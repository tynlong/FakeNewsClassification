281845,"We are told by the Administration that today’s estimated Federal budget deficit of $$296 billion is a triumph. The decrease is based on rising revenues, which are narrowing the gap with rising spending.

In short, economic growth is raising revenues. But can this economic growth be sustained? The Federal Reserve is now tightening the money supply — actually shrinking it (May 24 to July 20). If you don’t believe me, look at the statistics for the adjusted monetary base, the only monetary aggregate that the FED controls directly.

At the same time, price inflation is rising. This is the effect of previous monetary inflation. The Median CPI, which is the statistic that I use to monitor the price level, rose in June by .4% over May, which in turn had risen by .4% over April. Year to year, the figure is up by 3.2%. This figure is accelerating. It was up by 2.5%, January to January.

The FED’s present monetary policy is designed to reduce that rate of increase. The means of reducing price inflation is to cut monetary inflation. This policy raises short-term interest rates. Eventually, given the weak recovery of the economy since late 2001, this policy will produce a recession. That will end the rise in Federal revenues. The Federal deficit will expand — this time from the range of $$300 billion a year.

An inverted yield curve occurs when the short rate is higher than the long rate. This is the single most reliable indicator of a coming recession. The yield curve today is almost flat: a shrinking gap between 90-day T-bills (rising) and 30-year T-bonds (falling).

The FED is making one last stand, like Custer, against price inflation. It is guaranteeing a recession if it does not retreat from this policy — a policy that can save the dollar by allowing the American economy and the world economy to sink into recession. Nobody believes that Bernanke will hold to this policy of stable money when the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls by 2,000 points.

That is the home front. Now let’s look at the situation in Iraq.

THE CIVIL WAR IS HERE

Since May, the civilian death toll from the civil war has been in the range of 100 per day. That is for a population of 26 million. A comparable death toll for the United States would be 1,550 a day.

If, every day, over 1,500 Americans died from violence related to religious dissention, we would call this a civil war. But the U.S. government’s unofficial term is ""sectarian violence.""

Most of the reported violence is in Baghdad. By ""reported,"" I mean reported by the Baghdad morgue. There is violence outside the capital city, but with Sunni and Shi’ite populations so mixed in Baghdad, the level of violence is very high there.

There is nothing like this in northern Iraq, where the Kurds are dominant. But that constitutes only three of 21 provinces.

The largest single concentration of our troops is stationed mainly in the Green Zone, which is inside Baghdad. So, to keep the lid on the violence, our troops must be placed in harm’s way.

Recently, I read a first-hand account by a reporter who has been in and out of Iraq since the late 1970s, Patrick Cockburn (COEburn). He says that what he has seen in recent weeks is incomparable. On July 24, he wrote:

Some 3,149 people were killed in June alone, or more than 100 a day, and the figure is likely to rise higher this month because of tit-for-tat massacres by Sunni and Shia Muslims. Some 120 Shias were killed in two attacks earlier in the week and gunmen yesterday kidnapped 20 employees of a government agency in Baghdad looking after Sunni mosques and shrines.

The death toll has risen every month this year and totalled 5,818 in May and June. This far exceeds the number given by the Iraqi Coalition Casualty Count, a web site that compiles casualty figures based on published accounts, which said that 840 civilians died in June. Overall 14,000 civilians were killed in the first half of the year says the UN.

That figure would be the equivalent of 161,500 in the United States. Can you imagine the state of mind of Americans if Protestants and Roman Catholics were killing each other in these numbers? We would call it a return of the Thirty Years War (1618—48), in which half the population of Germany died in religious war. That was the most devastating war on civilians in European history.

Now, for the first time, the health ministry in Baghdad has told the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq, which publishes a bimonthly report on human rights, the exact death toll recorded by hospitals around the country. The central morgue in Baghdad provides figures for unidentified bodies, of which there were 1,595 in June. In the first six months of the year the number of Iraqi civilians dying violently rose by 77 per cent.

United States troops are sitting on top a cauldron of death, and the heat is being turned up. A conflict that had been suppressed by the Ba’athist Party’s secularism can no longer be suppressed.

The Americans are not part of the religious debate, except insofar as they imposed a democratic political order that assumes widespread public commitment to an overriding ""live and let live"" religious toleration. Such a policy grew out of the American experience, which in turn was heavily influenced by the desire to avoid anything like the German civil war and the English civil war (1642—49).

Such a policy is being attempted in Turkey, but it has taken since World War I to impose it, and only at the expense of personal liberty. For example, no woman may attend a tax-funded university if she wears a head covering. In Iraq, fashion disputes are handled differently.

The UN report paints a picture of Iraqi society dissolving under the stress of cumulative violence. Nobody is safe. A tennis coach and two players were shot dead in Baghdad for wearing shorts.

According to Cockburn, the Iraqi State is now getting in on the action.

Assassinations are often carried out by the security forces themselves. On June 3, for instance, 50 police cars surrounded the al-Arab mosque in Basra and killed 10 of the 20 people inside.

Within Baghdad, the violence is unthinkably bad, and it is getting worse.

Baghdad is now breaking up into a dozen different hostile cities, Sunni or Shia, heavily armed and living in terror of the other side. On July 9, Shia gunmen from the black-clad Mehdi Army entered the largely Sunni al-Jihad district in west Baghdad and killed 40 Sunni after dragging them from their cars or stopping them at false checkpoints. Within hours the Sunni militias struck back with car bombs killing more than 60 Shia.

We often speak of a nation’s infrastructure: roads, telecommunications, electricity, water. But the real infrastructure is the productive elements of the population: businessmen, physicians, engineers. It is creative people who make a society flourish. These people are leaving Iraq.

Many Iraqis have fled the country, mostly to Jordan and Syria, to avoid the violence. Syria now has 351,000 and Jordan 450,000 of these refugees, including 40 per cent of all Iraqi professionals, according to the US Committee for Refugees and Immigrants.

That would be the equivalent of about 9 million Americans fleeing the country.

Because of the traditional division of labor, certain occupations are dominated by one or another branch of Islam. This is now creating supply bottlenecks.

In many districts it has become difficult to buy bread because Sunni assassins have killed all the bakers who are traditionally Shia.

To this is added the new element of regional violence, the war in Lebanon.

""The government is all in the Green Zone like the previous one and they have left the streets to the terrorists,"" said Mahmoud Othman, a veteran Iraqi politician. He said the situation would be made worse by the war in Lebanon because it would intensify the struggle between Iran and the US being staged in Iraq. The Iraqi crisis would now receive much reduced international attention.

THE TAR PITS OF OIL

I grew up in the Los Angeles area. When I was a boy, I used to ride my bicycle from my grandparents’ home to the La Brea tar pits. The pits had not yet become the tourist attraction that they are today.

The pits fascinated me. Here, the remains of saber-toothed tigers and mammoths had been dug up. These creatures got trapped in the tar and sank. Their bones were preserved by the muck. They became valuable showpieces for the county museum. But, as they sank in the tar, I doubt that any of them was thinking, ""I’ll be a featured attraction someday."" They were thinking, ""I’ve got to get out!""

The United States has constructed over a dozen major air bases in Iraq. This has been public knowledge for over two years, yet it has received very little publicity in the major news media. A year after the invasion, in 2004, this was published on a Website devoted to global security.

""Is this a swap for the Saudi bases?"" asked Army Brig. Gen. Robert Pollman, chief engineer for base construction in Iraq. ""I don’t know. … When we talk about enduring bases here, we’re talking about the present operation, not in terms of America’s global strategic base. But this makes sense. It makes a lot of logical sense.""

Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, deputy chief of operations for the coalition in Iraq, said the military engineers are trying to prepare for any eventuality.

""This is a blueprint for how we could operate in the Middle East,"" Kimmitt said. ""[But] the engineering vision is well ahead of the policy vision. What the engineers are saying now is:

Let’s not be behind the policy decision. Let’s make this place ready so we can address policy options.""

The problem is this: The policy options did not include civil war and a resistance movement that is growing in both numbers and skills.

There is no indication that the Bush Administration has plans to leave Iraq. In January, 2009, the Administration will be replaced. The incoming Administration will then face the enormous problem of what to do with these bases.

Will our troops somehow secure them, operating inside besieged perimeters? It looks that way.

On the other hand, if the next Administration removes our troops and brings them home, who will inherit these bases? The national government of Iraq does not function today. Two and a half years from now, it is unlikely to exist at all. The civil war will have shattered whatever remains of the country, itself an invention of the British after World War I — an invention based on the Brits’ desire to control the allocation of the country’s oil, and also Kuwait’s, which was another British invention.

The United States is the heir to a role that the British decided to abandon, out of economic necessity, after World War II. That role is the role of policeman in those areas of special interest to the managers of the British empire. But the cost of maintaining this empire grew too great after World War II. They pulled out, leaving a vacuum. Harry Truman decided to fill the vacuum.

As taxpayers, we are being asked to maintain whatever remains of order in Iraq. The military cost of policing Iraq is rising daily. This will escalate as American troops find themselves more and more the only source of order, neighborhood by neighborhood, in the middle of an Islamic civil war.

I realize that those Americans who think we should pull out the troops will be accused of cutting and running. But those who make this accusation have yet to produce any policy that shows how American forces and American tax money can produce peace in the midst of a Sunni-Shi’ite civil war. This conflict is rooted in 1400 years of distrust and the longing for revenge. The Shi’ites’ major public liturgical rite is self-flagellation with whips, which is symbolic of the sect’s resentment against the Sunnis.

We have let two genies out of their respective bottles. They are now at war with each other. Our troops are caught in the middle.

Now the genies have moved on to Lebanon, where the Shi’ite Hezbollah has lured the Israelis into bombing Beirut, a Sunni city with Maronite Christian elements. The physical infrastructure is now rubble.

Warlords do not care what happens to the established government. Neither do guerilla leaders. They are happy to bring down such governments.

The human infrastructure has departed from Lebanon. At least 60,000 foreign residents have fled. The government claims that 500,000 people are now displaced from their homes. This, in a nation with a population of under four million. This is 13% of the population, the equivalent of almost 40 million Americans.

The scars there will remain. There will be capital flight. Families that lost their homes will have to start over. There will be resentment against Israel. The government has been shown to be militarily impotent. Soon, it will be bankrupt.

Add to this the threat of an air strike against Iran. If that takes place, the spot price of oil will go through $$100 in a week — and maybe a day.

The United States is in the tar pits. Nobody with enough votes to matter has proposed a plan to show how we are going to get out.

CONCLUSION

You must think through the implications of a tar pit for the American economy. I don’t mean the actual monetary expenditure, which is serious, but only a fraction of the Federal government’s total debt. Think of the implications for American self-confidence. Most important, think of this in terms of a training ground for regional terrorists.

When American forces are bottled up inside the bases, the message to the regional political leaders is simple: ""They came, they stayed, but those local politicians who relied on their help are in exile or else dead.""

We can see where all this is headed: a rising price of oil and a falling dollar.

We are already in the tar pit of the Middle East. To fund it, we have put the reputation of the American government on the line. Tied to that reputation is the dollar’s reserve currency status.

If you think the U.S. will extend its influence across the Middle East, then commit your capital to dollar-denominated assets. If you have serious doubts about our foreign policy, find non-dollar assets to buy, or assets that move up when the dollar’s purchasing power moves down.

But beware of the recession in between.

217697,"The mistake is one which was exposed in advance by Montesquieu: ""As it is a feature of democracies that to all appearance the people does almost exactly as it wishes, men have supposed that democratic governments were the abiding-place of liberty: they confused the power of the people with the liberty of the people."" This confusion of thought is at the root of modern despotism.

~ Bertrand de Jouvenel, On Power

The Scandinavian monarchs over the years have become more like hereditary presidents of their welfare states than kings.

~ Robert T. Elson, Life Magazine, April 6, 1964

One hundred years ago today Haakon VII was crowned and anointed King of Norway. This not only marks the centenary of the last Scandinavian coronation. It also in a way marks a hundred years since the ""coronation"" of the work of 1905, which included parting with Sweden and basically the completion of parting with the old monarchical order. This is a remarkable paradox. A coronation marks the dawn of the democratic age.

I wrote about the democratic transition in Norway in a couple of articles about a year ago; one with a wider historical perspective and another concentrating more on Oscar II — in a long and short [LRC] version.

It was the Danish Prince Carl who was made King of Norway as a part of the events of 1905. However, King Oscar II was offered the throne of Norway for a prince of his house, provided that such a prince renounced his rights to the throne of Sweden. This was a tactical move partly to make the coup or revolution look less revolutionary to the outside world, and partly to ease the conservatives. The Norwegian coup-makers had no wish for a king from the House of Bernadotte. The Swedish Prince Carl was the most probable candidate for the throne from the House of Bernadotte. According to historian Roy Andersen the Swedish Prince Carl told Norwegian representatives that he had no interest in being a ""marionette troll"" at the palace in Christiania. This expression is a much better description of the kind of monarch Norway has had since 1905 than ""constitutional monarch.""

The Norwegian Parliament moved to depose Oscar II as King of Norway basically because he asserted his right to say no to what democratically elected politicians had moved. If we go beyond the formal technicalities, this is the issue. The declaration of June 7, 1905 from the Norwegian Parliament is a piece of exquisite art of phrasing. It does not mention the denial of royal sanction, which was never written into the official records of the Council of State as it was never countersigned. The parliamentary declaration is concerned with the King’s constitutional duty of providing the country with a Cabinet. It claims the King deposed himself by not providing the country with a Cabinet. It was based on a document from 1847, i.e., from before parliamentarism, that Cabinet secretaries had the right to resign instead of countersigning a royal act.

There are Norwegian scholars who believe the act of June 7, 1905 was not constitutionally in order, but they excuse it because it was democratically endorsed or secured democracy. They especially refer to the referendum of August 13, 1905, in which only 184 — or 0.05 % — said nay to the ""union dissolution that had taken place."" Other scholars say the Parliament’s act of June 7, 1905 was constitutionally in order. Professor of law Ola Mestad bases his view on the fact that the declaration did not touch the issue of royal veto, but only the right of the Cabinet secretaries to resign and the King’s duty to hold a Cabinet. These factors supposedly make the Parliament’s act constitutionally in order. Lawyer Cecilie Schjatvet has claimed that the union was dissolved both de facto and de jure both constitutionally and when it comes to international law on June 7, 1905. She bases this theory on a presumption that the Swedish state cannot be considered absolute. One could wonder what Ms. Schjatvet thinks of the absolute power of the Norwegian Parliament.

It can easily be imagined what outrage there would be if the King were to declare that the Parliament had deposed itself because, as the King sees it, it has failed to fulfill some constitutional duty.

Christopher Bruun, a priest, wrote a pamphlet to the Norwegian people in 1905. No Norwegian publisher would print it. He had to go to Copenhagen to get it printed. The pamphlet has some wisdom to offer those who are overwhelmed with how well the coup d’état was implemented:

Wrongdoing does not cease being wrongdoing if it is exercised in the nicest forms and with the greatest skill.

It has also been claimed that since Crown Prince Regent Gustaf was warned of the Cabinet laying down their offices if the Act of Consulates was not sanctioned, and since the King and Crown Prince were quite passive during the crisis, the events of May and June of 1905 cannot be labeled a revolution.

A crime is still a crime if it is defended with the most perfectly constructed — and in themselves irreproachable — phrases in court. A crime is still a crime if warning is given of its being committed. Such a crime is still a crime if such warnings do not result in precautions being taken. Before the terrorist attack against the American Embassy in Nairobi in 1998 warnings were reportedly given, and these warnings were reportedly not taken seriously. That does not make the attack any less a crime.

A murder is still a crime if the popular majority approves of it. As Christopher Bruun’s pamphlet tells us:

And the wrong we have exercised does certainly not get better if the entire people learn to shout: it is not we who have done wrong, it is the King.

On the Contrary. That the people learn to turn moral concepts upside down is amongst the worst sides of the issue.

There are a lot of people who walk about with an unclear feeling that when the people or its majority agree on something, it must also be right. Perhaps they do not say it, but it is a part of their mindset. The majority does have the might in many ways to legalize what was formerly illegal. So it must then also have the ability to make wrong right.

And then we have the confusion of moral concepts going like an epidemic.

The fairy tale style story of the harmonious peacefully agreeing people of the August 13 referendum is probably quite widespread. Norwegians deplore similar referendum and election results in countries ""with which we do not want to be compared."" Professor of history Nils Ivar Agøy, amongst others, has made an honorable attempt at destroying this fairy tale view and myth. Dr. Agøy tells us that the August referendum was set up so that there could not be a shadow of a doubt as to whether the Parliament’s act of June 7 was final and legitimate.

If one did not believe that the Parliament’s act to depose the King and dissolve the union was legally, constitutionally, or otherwise in order, one could not take part in the referendum. As Agøy notes:

[B]y voting at all they accepted that [the dissolution of the union] had ""taken place"" (the question was a good example of the ""have you stopped beating your wife?"" type).

The referendum was about discipline, propaganda, angry mobs attacking those few who dared show dissent, and the likes. August 13, 1905 was a Sunday. The referendum largely had its polls in churches. Polling stations were decorated with propaganda for yea to the dissolution. Churches were decorated with Norwegian flags. Typically, a service was held where the parish was told that it was God’s will that the union was to be dissolved. Then the parish went to the polls.

According to Agøy the August referendum is no measure of popular agreement with the act of June 7. He notes:

We do also have many testimonies that people who up to June 7 wished to preserve the union voted yea August 13. This was not necessarily because they had altered their views, but rather because voting nay could not serve any good. It would not bring the union back, but it could make the situation worse for the country in August.

It should be added that probably a considerable amount of men voted yea due to pressure. Agøy notes on the 184 nay voters:

[T]he sources suggest that not a few of them [the nay voters] voted as they did because they took their oaths to Constitution and King more seriously than others, i.e., something concerning the revolutionary sides of the act of June 7, but not the view of the union as such.

We can discuss the issue of might versus right in constitutional history a lot. People tell me it is interesting, but not very relevant for our time. This side won, that side lost. Which side was constitutionally in the right is interesting, but the important thing is which side won, because politics is about might, and the actual outcome is what we are living with today. That is exactly the problem. We have to live with it. We can put all constitutional considerations aside. The fact remains that the limited and mixed governments of the 19th century were far friendlier towards liberty than today’s mass democracies. The Norwegian events of 1905 are a defeat for the concept of limited government and limited parliamentary power.

It is a common claim that 1905 marks the end of the transition to constitutionalism, i.e., that constitutionalism was not fully implemented before the end of Bernadotte rule in Norway. This is true if constitutionalism denotes that the King is completely subject to politicians, and basically cannot interfere in politics. I.e., it is true if the concept denotes a system where the King is basically powerless and at the complete mercy of Parliament, in that Parliament for instance may redefine the monarchy totally, e.g., by redefining how the throne is inherited. It may even abolish the monarchy completely if the royal office or family does not ""behave"" or loses popularity in the opinion polls. It is not true if constitutionalism denotes a system where the government is limited by a constitution. Nor is it true if constitutionalism denotes a system where the constitution is abided by. Today politicians basically define and redefine the Constitution at will. If constitutionalism denotes a government ""of laws, not of men,"" our history since 1905 is definitely not a history of constitutionalism.

It has been claimed that the term constitutional monarchy denotes a monarchy where it does not matter who is monarch. This is supposedly because the monarch is just to see to it that the Constitution is upheld. Now, if we apply an equivalent definition to constitutional democracy, this term would denote a system where it does not matter who the people are — or who the politicians are. They are just there to see that the Constitution is upheld. Does that sound like any democracy you know?

The election of Danish Prince Carl as King of Norway and his taking the name Haakon VII are often referred to as the establishment of a new monarchy. This is not so. Notwithstanding propaganda from the time giving another impression, no new monarchy was established. Of course, the monarchy was different after 1905 than before. However, the Swedish monarchy was different after the total emasculation of the King in the 1970’s, but it still is not referred to as a new monarchy as if it were a newborn baby. The Norwegian throne was the same through the events of 1905. It became vacant by King Oscar II’s abdication on October 26, 1905. Through a referendum — often, erroneously, referred to as a vote on the form of government — the people concurred in asking the Danish Prince Carl to accept this throne.

Constitutional amendments were passed in 1905, including introducing a requirement that an heir to the throne had to be born in wedlock. They were passed unconstitutionally in November because of the new constitutional situation. The union was gone, and provisions no longer relevant were amended. It is often referred to as ""emergency law."" It was Parliament that had acted unconstitutionally in the first place, so that’s a pretty poor excuse. In a way you could say our Constitution is from 1905, since it at that time was unconstitutionally amended. However, it is dated May 17, 1814. No formal changes were made to our Constitution in November 1905 regarding royal powers.

The lack of formal constitutional changes notwithstanding, what rose out of 1905 was basically a parody of a republican form of government, i.e., a republic in a monarchy’s clothing. The Swedish-Norwegian union was a construction of the age of dynastic monarchies. The ""new"" monarchy was a ""national monarchy,"" a concept mainly promoted by Sigurd Ibsen, son of Henrik Ibsen. The concept of national monarchy was basically that the monarchy belonged to the nation, and this concept broke radically with the old order, where territories belonged to monarchies.

When Prime Minister Michelsen was seeking a unanimous act of Parliament in June of 1905, he was seeking as few changes as possible. The parliament was only to dissolve the union. If there were any old school monarchists in Parliament at the time, they were seriously had.

The events of May and June 1905 provide an excellent recipe for how a king who does not ""behave"" can be handled. The success of Parliament’s unconstitutional act is a great manifestation of popular sovereignty. So are our two first referenda, which both took place in 1905 — with a three-month interval. The provisional Cabinet acted solely on parliamentary authority from Parliament from June to November in 1905. Those who negotiated with the future King were republicans in principle, and they were decidedly democrats. They had no interest in letting the constitutional order where there was a check on popular or parliamentary power survive. The same kind of people, and to an extent the same people, were ""king makers"" and ""king raisers"" in the period following the ascension of King Haakon VII. The premises for the November referendum were also quite clear. The Bernadotte ""partisan monarchy"" had been discredited. No interference in ""self-rule"" was to be tolerated.

In the parliamentary debate on the November referendum the not-so-representative Alfred Eriksen expressed:

Everyone knows that if there now is established a monarchy in this country, it will not be a monarchy by the grace of God, it will not even be by the grace of the people; it will at the most be a monarchy by the grace of Michelsen.

The Speaker of Parliament, Carl Berner, who had given Michelsen the idea of declaring the King deposed and the union dissolved almost at the last moment, also spoke. Obviously he was not acting as Speaker at the time. According to Professor of law Ola Mestad this was the most representative position in Parliament:

[W]e have come so far that if we now get our own Norwegian King, we can be sure that it would be a constitutional monarchy we would commence, and thus we would also have complete security for a complete self-government without a trace of limitation.

The provisional Cabinet’s proclamation — according to Mestad, formally a part of the basis of the referendum — says:

The political liberty of a people depends first of all on its constitutional right to decide its own destiny and on the people’s maturity and ability to use the Constitution, — but less on the question on whether the head of state is called King or President. The English people’s political liberty is as complete as that of any other people, and the new Italian monarchy has promoted the development and popular freedom of Italy as safely and quickly as any republic. In the democratic societies of our time the forms of monarchy or republic mean little and by the way prove nothing regarding the political liberty of the people and the size and strength of self-government.

Mestad notes that it is Great Britain, the mother of parliamentarism — or parliamentary government, and Italy with the new powerless King that are the role models, not Norway’s neighbors Sweden and Denmark. Nor is the monarchy that Norway has had a role model. I would add that neither Russia, Germany, nor the Habsburg Empire are set up as good examples.

Fridtjof Nansen, Norwegian polar explorer and national hero and then future Nobel peace laureate spoke on the day before the referendum commenced:

I can understand that there are people who find the republican form of government more ideal, I am myself not very fond of the monarchy, and I would gladly take part in abolishing it if anyone with certainty could give us a form of government that is more ideal and could give us greater advantages for the future, — and if I were certain that the republican form of government were as ideal in reality as it looks on paper. What I have seen of republics, and that is of the most developed and high standing, has not convinced me thereof. I have gotten the impression that they are very far from being ideal.

Later on in the same speech he tells the audience:

There is, however, as great differences between the different republics as between republic and monarchy. The American President has more power than any monarch in Europe, even if we include the Tsar. […] In the French Republic there is a president who has no power.

According to Mestad several changes were made regarding the royal office. King Oscar II and his predecessors had advisors in matters of state apart from the Council of State. Haakon VII had no such advisors. Previously documents in cases to be brought before the King’s Council — also known as Council of State or simply the Cabinet — were sent to the King in advance. Not so with King Haakon VII, at least with Haakon VII there were only a few exceptions to the rule that information was only given first at the Council meeting. There was also a question of whether the King could go with the minority in the Council. Prime Minister Michelsen had made it clear that the majority ruled even when the Prime Minister was with the minority. The King did not buy this — at least not immediately — and he asked for a private meeting with Michelsen. King Haakon VII is reported to have said at an occasion when he took a handkerchief out of his pocket:

This, you see, is something in which I am allowed to poke my nose.

Democratically elected politicians obviously do not want kings poking their noses in ""their business"" of poking their noses in other people’s business. Democratically elected politicians are moreover far better at poking their noses — or authorizing bureaucrats to do so — in other things than handkerchiefs.

Prince Carl was born and raised in the monarchical age. The basically curbed post-1905 monarchy is probably due to a combination of causes, including pre-1905 events, 1905 events, staunch democratist politicians, and an active choice of Haakon VII of not challenging democracy. He was at times harsh when he had differences with politicians, but he basically kept those differences behind the scenes.

Servility is probably a poor description of the new monarch. He might have done well as an ""interfering"" monarch. I was once told that with the way it went with monarchies with active monarchs it would have little purpose for Haakon VII to be one. Perhaps, but what is definitely more certain is that the democratic-republican age was not a historically necessity. It can be tactically wise to choose a winning side, but it is not necessarily the right thing to do.

Haakon VII saw as his duty to serve his people. What we have had since 1905 has been denoted a ""people’s monarchy."" Princess Märtha Louise — the sister of our current Crown Prince — was once interviewed about the expression ""people’s monarchy"" and what it meant. She answered that a ""people’s monarchy"" is a monarchy where the monarchy serves the people and not the other way around. Well, any monarchy is there to serve the people. The modern misconception is that the people are best served with unlimited democracy — or with the absolute rule of democratically elected politicians — and monarchs letting this absolutism rule.

There is little doubt — if any — that King Haakon VII took his duty seriously. He is known to have said — adhering to an old king moral — that a king is either completely alive or completely dead. To him it was a disgrace not to show due to bad health. One could say he adhered to the motto of Ibsen’s character Brand:

What you are be so fully and wholly, not partly and divided.

Haakon VII did not always rubber-stamp the decisions of the Cabinet immediately. There were occasions where he had decisions postponed when he was in disagreement with his Cabinet. He at least once called a conference at the Royal Palace to turn his Cabinet. According to former secretary for the Council of State Dag Berggrav, the King had a conference with the Secretary of Defense, the Commanding General, and the Commanding Admiral. His Majesty convinced both the general and the admiral, and then the Defense Secretary turned as well. It has also been said that Haakon VII had a certain space within which to act in foreign policy.

Haakon VII did at least at a couple of occasions threaten with abdication. One could say that this does not leave the King totally emasculated. After all, threatening with abdication can often be the most effective means of getting one’s way. This is true, and Oscar II did at least once threaten to abdicate as King of Sweden. However, what is probably more important than the means that are used to have one’s ways is how the roles are.

A striking difference between Norway’s pre-1905 and post-1905 periods is that prior to 1905 the King was after all King, and the Council was the body of his advisors. After 1905 the Cabinet was ""King,"" and the King was ""Council."" Before 1905 the Council could try to convince the King and the last resort was threatening to resign. After 1905 it was the King who had to convince the Council of State, and if he picked a fight, he was the one who had to threaten — as the last resort — with his resignation. The roles were basically switched.

It has been claimed that Haakon VII’s no to appointing a Nazi Cabinet in April 1940 is the last we ever saw of personal royal power. However, it was clear also here that the roles were like the said post-1905 roles. The King made it clear that the decision belonged to the Cabinet, but that he no longer would be King if the Cabinet gave in to the invaders.

Another — not so well known — threat of abdication came when politicians wanted to curb the King’s formal powers and strip him of the right to award orders. This was around 1913. The institution of orders was preserved, and the King’s formal powers were left intact. However, in 1913 the last doubt of whether there was any right of veto when it comes to constitutional amendments was removed. The arrangement of the King announcing constitutional amendments, as opposed to sanctioning or giving assent, was then put in writing. [Note: This amendment itself was announced by the King, not sanctioned. Any old school monarchist looking for a quarrel could have some fun with that. Additionally, one could theoretically have a possibility of an ""announcement strike"" when it comes to a constitutional amendment.] Already in 1911 it had been made clear that any decision in the Council of State had to be countersigned to be valid. At the same time military commands, i.e., from the royal office, were made subject to countersignature. In 1931 the Council of State was stripped of some powers regarding making treaties, but at that point the power already belonged to politicians. The power was moved from the Council of State to Parliament.

Professor of history Ole Kristian Grimnes believes that the victory of parliamentarism was secured with the events of 1905. So do Professor of political science Trond Nordby and Professor of law Ola Mestad. Some claim the transition to parliamentarism was not completed until the passing of the Act of Accountability in 1932. King Haakon VII appointed the first Labor Cabinet in 1928, defying advice from the politically established parties on the right. This is a defiance of parliamentarism. However, no clear alternative was presented to His Majesty, and it was clearly a part of a strategy of building a monarchy where also socialists were included — ""the people’s monarchy."" It was probably not a move to install a Cabinet of the King’s liking. Moreover, this Cabinet lived for no longer than 18 days, after having fallen by a parliamentary vote of no confidence, which it respected. Why the King treated the national socialists, whom he refused audience, differently than those who had sympathy with the Soviet regime we will leave here.

The Act of Accountability clearly states that members of the Cabinet are accountable to the Impeachment Tribunal for upholding the Constitution, other laws, and acts of Parliament and avoiding what is harmful to the realm. Violating the Constitution, breaching other laws, or contributing to something harmful to the realm may result in up to 10 years imprisonment. Being disloyal to acts of Parliament, however, may only result in up to 5 years imprisonment. Of course, in practice the Act of Accountability only applies to violations of the Constitution that Parliament finds troublesome. So a member of the Cabinet may find it better to violate the Constitution than to defy an act of Parliament in spite of the higher level of punishment for violating the Constitution. Moreover, a vote of no confidence — so it seems like someone is holding someone responsible — is more likely in a political milieu where ""everyone scratches everyone else’s backs"" instead of actually giving real content to the word accountability.

When World War II was over, King Haakon VII’s authority was arguably at a peak. He had led the resistance from London with his Cabinet, which many did not have much confidence in. Haakon VII headed the Council of State every Friday, which still is the normal day for Cabinet meetings, with few exceptions during the exile period at what today is the Norwegian ambassadorial residence in London. He lived at Windsor Castle due to the risk of bombings in the area of the embassy.

According to former employee with the Royal Norwegian Court Carl-Erik Grimstad, there were efforts made to revive personal royal powers at this time. Grimstad calls them political tinkers — a mostly derogatory phrase meaning basically someone who minds matters he does not have sufficient knowledge about, etymologically arising from Ludvig Holberg’s The Political Tinker. I do not know about those behind this proposal when it comes to the term political tinker, but democracy has steadily reduced requirements as to knowing what you are doing or talking about when engaging in politics. Age requirements are no exception. For instance, the voting age in 1905 was 25 years. Today it is 18 years. In 1905 the age requirement for being a member of Cabinet was 30 years. In the 1970’s it was reduced from 30 to 18. Mass democracy’s worship of lack of knowledge and wisdom is nothing to celebrate. Rolling some of it back would be progress. One way of doing this could be restoring some royal power. Grimstad should be more careful with the phrase political tinker. Using the term against limiting democracy suggests not knowing the anti-democrat theme of The Political Tinker.

Haakon is said to have disapproved of the proposal of increased royal powers, as it would supposedly destroy everything he had built up since he came to Norway in 1905.

There was a coronation a hundred years ago today in Trondhjem. One could think that with this coronation that all the outer, ceremonial, and symbolic stuff related to the monarchy remained intact. This is not so. Prime Minister Michelsen hated what he called royal posture. The uniforms of the members of Cabinet and civil officials were abolished the day before Haakon VII landed in Christiania. Royal heralds were abolished. The Royal Order of the Norwegian Lion was never formerly abolished — at least not in the correct manner — but it was never awarded after 1905. The Prime Minister was no longer to be addressed as ""Excellency."" According to an oral private statement by Professor of law Ola Mestad, “Excellency” was something Michelsen got rid of. There was a considerable republican sentiment in Norway in 1905, and the theme often went that if we were to have a monarchy, it was to be as republican as possible. Michelsen’s own vision for the monarchy was ""a King as simple as the people itself.""

Some ceremonial stuff remained though. Up until the end of the reign of King Olav V there was the institution of dissolving Parliament — with a ceremony with the King — at the end of each parliamentary year. It was then abolished. This happened long after people had stopped questioning the legitimacy of Parliament being convened all year round. Now, Parliament does have vacations. Norwegians are, however, so brainwashed by egalitarianism that they have a tendency to complain that parliamentarians have longer vacations than other people instead of rejoicing over the long parliamentary vacations and demanding more of it so that Parliament can do less wrong.

In 1905 oaths were an important part of official life. Until 1899 one had to give an oath to the Constitution in order to be registered as a voter. Many of the members of Parliament in 1905 were still bound by that oath. In addition, there were officers’ and officials’ oaths, and their oaths were to King and Constitution. In November of 1814 there was a parliamentary oath to King and Constitution, but according to the parliamentary archives there has been no such oath since then. There never really was an equivalent to the British parliamentary Oath of Allegiance. Today, there is only the officials’ oath left, and it may be replaced by affirmation — in the case of foreigners, left out — in addition to the King’s and that of the Crown Prince. Moreover, today there are few officials in Parliament or Cabinet, if any, and the few certainly would not take their oaths as seriously as in 1905. Also, according to historian Nils Ivar Agøy, the court system has announced that oaths have reduced significance. Of course, given the way the American President sticks to his oath one could wonder what the point with oaths is.

In 1905 it was a two-way street. Today it is a one-way street. The royal office is basically a subject to democracy. The price we pay for this is not negligible. In the days of Henrik Ibsen it was normal to sign letters to the King with, e.g., ""Underdanigst,"" which would translate into something like ""Your subject."" This goes for Ibsen himself as well. Tell an average Norwegian today that he is someone’s subject, and he will jump up and shout you down. Yet, we are today more in subjection in practice than Ibsen and his contemporaries probably ever would have accepted being.

June 22, 1906 was coronation day. Norwegian coronations had been more in line with the concept of popular sovereignty through the 19th century. E.g., when giving their coronational oaths the monarchs as Kings of Norway raised two fingers against the public, as opposed to in Sweden where the fingers were placed on the Bible. It must be noted, however, that according to the original Norwegian Constitution of 1814, the King was to be King by the grace of God and according to the Constitution of the Realm. Moreover, although a bishop led the ceremony, the Prime Minister took part in placing the crown on the King’s head. So when we were having our ""more democratic"" and simpler coronation of 1906 — when the royal couple was driven in a horse-drawn carriage to the cathedral, instead of walking under a ""throne heaven"" — Michelsen’s placing the crown on the monarchs head was only new in the sense that it was the first time a parliamentary Prime Minister did this. It is tempting to see this as a symbol of the new monarch as King by the grace of Michelsen. The Prime Minister had no part in the anointment. Given King Oscar II’s hard feelings there was no official Swedish representation at the ceremony.

The die-hard republicans had tried to stop the coronation in 1906. They wanted it all postponed until Parliament could vote on amending the Constitution to abolish the coronation and anointment. They did not succeed. However, in 1908 they succeeded in striking the provision on coronation and anointment from the Constitution against two honorable votes. The institution supposedly belonged in the Middle Ages and ""our neighboring countries could be said to have abolished the institution."" Well, Norway’s first coronation brought about a law-bound royal office, according to royal biographer Langslet. I guess law-bound authority belongs in the Middle Ages. Now the god Demos was to rule, and god Demos cannot have the competition which a coronation — and especially an anointment — represents. Popular sovereignty was to rule, and so the coronation had to go. As for the claim about ""our neighboring countries,"" Russia and the United Kingdom were our neighbors at the time. Now, Sweden and Denmark are generally the countries included in that term. King Oscar II had passed away only three months before the constitutional amendment. The new Swedish King, Gustaf V, did not want the pomp and circumstance of a coronation. To say that this constitutes abolition is dubious at best. Politicians have strange ways of reaching conclusions.

King Olav V and his son King Harald V both had blessing ceremonies — sometimes erroneously referred to as coronations. This kind of ceremony is not an act of state. The coronation with its anointment was. The remaining act of state for our monarch when ascending the throne is the oath given in Parliament. The fact that King Haakon VII held his hand high above his head, more like kings of old, his son, King Olav V, held his hand up more like we see American presidents at their inaugurations, and our present King Harald V did not hold his hand up at all also illustrates the decline in the monarchy.

King Olav V is known for having taken the city train when going skiing during the petroleum crisis of the 1970’s. The Norwegian royals go in cars and other modern forms of transportation for official ceremonies. If you want royal carriages and horses, you have to go to places like Copenhagen and London. Of course, I am not suggesting that monarchy belongs in the past just like horses and carriages. In a sense it is a good thing that the royals travel in cars to Parliament for the opening ceremony. It shows that monarchy has a place in the modern world. However, one cannot avoid getting the impression that the seeming obsession with using modern transportation is connected with an obsession of distancing the ""new"" Norwegian monarchy from the past.

It is important to note that all the ceremonial stuff and pomp and circumstance of monarchies are important, but they are not the core of the monarchical system.

In Ibsen’s The Pretenders Haakon tells Count Skule:

What is it that’s tempting you? The King’s ring, the cape with a scarlet edge, the right to sit three steps above the floor; — disgrace, disgrace, — was that being king, then I would throw the kingdom in your hat as I throw a small coin to a beggar.

In Ibsen’s Emperor and Galilean a grain merchant by the name of Medon comes to Emperor Julian complaining about a man wearing a scarlet cape. The Emperor tells Medon to come the next morning for some scarlet boots. The Emperor tells Medon:

These boots you will carry to Alites, put them on him and tell him that he definitely must put them on whenever he hereafter gets the idea to show himself in a scarlet cape in the light of day —

After a short interruption by Medon the Emperor continues:

— and when you so have done, you can tell him from me that he is a fool if he believes to be honored by the scarlet cape without owning the power of scarlet.

Although 1905 in several ways marks the end of the old order in Norway, there are ways in which it was not an end of the old order. The House of Glücksborg, as a branch of the House of Oldenborg was more of the old order than the House of Bernadotte, which was a product of the French Revolution.

Moreover, Crown Prince Olav was to be educated specially. He had private teachers, though he did also go to public school. Nowadays, it is almost seen as a matter of course that princes and princesses are to be sent to kindergulags — popularly known as daycare centers and kindergartens — and to public ""schools,"" whose educational qualities can be seriously questioned. Even though it still can be said that princes and princesses get life-long training, this educational egalitarianism, which no one should be subjected to, can severely jeopardize the concept of the monarch’s special training for the job. The value of monarchy is quite reduced if the monarch is brought up to be like everyone else.

Furthermore, Crown Prince Olav married Swedish Princess Märtha. That was a part of the old order that survived 1905. It has, however, not survived till today. These days, princes and princesses choose consorts of the lowest order — or as they say consorts with ""pasts.""

In this day and age, many people see the Norwegian royal family as an exercise in worshiping commonness. Other expressions that can be heard are that it is nice to have the royal family for Constitution Day celebrations on May 17, but otherwise we do not need them.

Every once in a while we hear an argument against the monarchy regarding certain members of the royal family having impunity. First of all, republics too have impunity for the head of state. The American President cannot be prosecuted before he fails to be reelected, resigns, or is removed by impeachment. In Norway, the King cannot be prosecuted, and he cannot be brought in as a witness. Certain other members of the royal family answer only to the King, or a specifically appointed judge — by the King — for this purpose. The King and these other members of the royal family are not above the law, as often is claimed, they are merely beyond prosecution.

It is often claimed that the institution of impunity is a remnant of absolutism, feudalism, or both. It all depends on the mood of the day, and the rather arbitrary use of the terms absolutism and feudalism demonstrate that those who use them mostly do not know what they are talking about. Montesquieu warned about the possibility of being able to prosecute the monarch. It could be used to bring down the royal office — or as he put it:

His person should be sacred, because as it is necessary for the good of the state to prevent the legislative body from rendering themselves arbitrary, the moment he is accused or tried there is an end of liberty.

So a legally irreproachable monarch might as well be a remnant of Montesquieu as it might be of absolutism or feudalism. But very often pundits do not know what they are talking about. They would probably neither know that Montesquieu warned against the executive not being able to restrain the encroachments of the legislature. If not, he warned, the ""latter would become despotic,"" as it would take the ""authority it pleased"" and ""would soon destroy all the other powers."" What the despotic legislature, which Montesquieu warned against, does on a near to daily basis today is a much larger problem than a few royals not getting a few speeding tickets. The irreproachable acts of parliamentarians are much more to worry about. Moreover, the public eye on the royal family probably has a much more disciplining effect on the royal family than law courts and the police have on the average commoner. If not, we have a serious problem, and it’s not that the royals are not disciplined enough.

In our time the monarch is almost totally emasculated. So one could say the arguments of Montesquieu no longer are relevant. However, heads of state generally, as mentioned earlier, cannot be prosecuted as long as they are heads of state. Furthermore, the impunity of certain members of the royal house may have a moderating effect in a country where government is increasingly far-reaching. More and more legislation is passed. The common citizen might soon not be able to move his two feet without committing a ""crime."" His fright of the despotic government may be moderated by the fact that its top representative seems not to care about a little speeding or not wearing a seat belt. In the case of King Olav V it was about a matter of principle of individual liberty for his people when it came to not wearing a seat belt. Let us care about the irreproachable acts of Parliament instead. That’s a far greater problem than the largely theoretical debate about royals ""not being accountable for their actions.""

Our royal office is not totally emasculated. There are certain personal prerogatives remaining, such as the right to approve consorts of princes and princesses, the right to award orders, and the right to appoint members of the royal court. The meetings of the Council of State, which His Majesty still formally appoints, are still generally held at the Royal Palace in Oslo. All Cabinet decisions must be made before either the King or the Crown Prince Regent, save when these have been relieved of the duty of holding Cabinet meetings due to bad health or travel. The Cabinet often comes together without any royals present to discuss and decide things in reality. However, decisions must formally be made either in an official Council of State meeting or by a single Cabinet member if he has been granted the right to do so in the matter.

The constitutional provisions giving the King relief from heading Council of State meetings have for a long time been interpreted liberally, and the argument goes that it does not do any harm, since the royal office does not really take part in the decisions. This is, however, not completely true. The King or the Crown Prince may ask questions. Direct initiative to have cases postponed for instance has not come from the royal office since the days of Haakon VII. If the royal office is not represented, there may be questions that are not asked, and questions have had consequences in the past. They may have so in the future as well.

Not only are questions asked. The royal office may ask for more information. King Olav V did just that, especially in cases concerning pardons. Often information is given in separate meetings, and there are regular meetings with the King and the Prime Minister and with the King and the Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Moreover, King Olav V is said to have been furious when he heard of leaks. The phenomenon of the media getting hold of cases before they were at his table was not viewed friendly. However, there was no question that he would sign whatever he was asked to sign. He even rubber-stamped legislation on abortion, an issue he was deeply concerned with personally.

As for the mentioned orders, there are absolutely good reasons for keeping these outside the political sphere. That is not to say that this institution could not be kept outside the political sphere without being protected by the royal office, but it seems to be going quite well, and so there is no reason to put it at risk.

The question has been asked whether the institution of holding meetings of the Council of State before the royal office is unnecessary formalism. Well, everyone going to a Cabinet meeting at the palace knows that this is serious business. The Cabinet Secretaries have to be well prepared. They know the King may ask questions. Questions may be asked in the following public debate as well, but it probably is a good thing that an experienced authority may ask questions before the matter becomes a question of saving face. Abolishing the institution will probably not make things much worse. After all, the partisan Cabinet basically does what it wants. However, the possibility of things getting better is close to — if not at — zero. Moreover, abolishing the institution will probably also abolish the opportunity of the monarch acting in an emergency. The moderating effect of the weak royal office should not be overrated, but not underrated either. Those who want to abolish the monarch’s overseeing the work of the Cabinet either hate the monarchy, hate anything that would moderate popular or parliamentary rule, or underrate said moderating effect.

Stripping the monarch of more power would probably prevent him from even acting in crises and unclear political situations. In emergencies is perhaps when we need modern monarchs the most. Stripping them of their powers when we do not see such an emergency coming is easy. The problem is that we will find out too late what an error we have made.

Personally, I would restore the royal powers at least to the level at which they were on February 26, 1884 — the day before the ""verdict"" of the Impeachment Tribunal against the Selmer Cabinet, a ""verdict"" that was substantial in bringing about parliamentary government in Norway — tomorrow if I could. The problem, of course, is the lack of realism in this plan. Effective royal powers are probably not going to be seen in Europe anytime soon, save the principalities of Liechtenstein and Monaco.

So why can’t we just abolish it altogether? We can have ""real checks and balances"" with a constitutional republic, which — it is said — is a concept that is more likely to succeed. It is perhaps true that we can have more real checks and balances than in the current system — but not compared to the real mixed governments of old — by abandoning the monarchy. However, that implies going for something basically like the American presidential system.

A relevant question then is how effective has the American system been lately at keeping the reach and the size of the state in check. The likelihood of such a system replacing the current system is furthermore minimal. Moreover, the Norwegian establishment hates the American system. Some of the reasons for this are good, some not. The Norwegian establishment will never go for a system like the American one. Besides, the American system is a one-party system with two party wings; the Demopublicans and the Republicrats. This party system controls both the legislative and executive branches of government, and it is quite successful at limiting the judiciary’s ability to serve as a check and balance on the other two branches. At times the party system even wants to fill the judiciary with loyal partisans. To call this system ""real checks and balances"" would be an insult to the late French Baron of Montesquieu — and other thinkers of limited government for that matter.

A republican form of government would require an amendment to the Constitution. This is generally done by Parliament. Is Parliament likely to set up a system that in any real way will limit the power of Parliament? And in the unlikely event of Parliament ceding the authority of amending the Constitution to some other body, this body will hardly consist of representatives who will give us a more liberty-friendly constitution than what we in reality have today.

One of the most likely options when abolishing the monarchy would be replacing the monarch with a Parliament-appointed president. Such a president would take care of ceremonial duties and chair the Cabinet meetings. He would have no more power than the King has today. He would have his authority from Parliament. An active or retired politician asking questions to the Cabinet instead of a King would hardly be an improvement.

Probably it would be a change for the worse. We would basically exchange the non-partisan review of Cabinet decisions with a partisan review and a politicization of the office of head of state.

Besides, the Swedish constitutional system is today designed in such a way that it is Parliament, not the King, that in practice as well as formally appoints the Prime Minister. The role of appointing the Cabinet has already been taken away from the King of Sweden. If one wanted ""real checks and balances,"" one could simply let the office of Prime Minister be put up for popular election. Yet, there are republicans who claim that the only way to have ""separation of powers"" is to abolish the monarchy.

If I were to give one good reason for abolishing the monarchy, it would be the level to which the monarchy has fallen in several respects. It no longer exercises power. If it did, it would probably not survive. Members of the royal house strive for being like commoners. However, I do not believe replacing the monarchy would make things better. Moreover, we could easily be fooled — overrating the non-democratic element of the government — by the present system. This phenomenon of overrating seems to be quite present in the United Kingdom. One could argue that removing the monarchy would be an eye-opener in this respect.

Norway is said to have the most egalitarian culture in the Western world. Yet, we have a monarchy. Notwithstanding the royals’ efforts to be basically like everyone else, this monarchy represents a substantial element of inequality. Some may argue that it is forced inequality, funded by the tax-payers, and so it must go. Those who want to abolish the monarchy because they are against all kinds of inequalities are not to be trusted. Those who generally believe that inequality is good, but that monarchy represents the wrong kind, should think about the consequences in society of removing the monarchy for egalitarian and anti-egalitarian sentiments. Notwithstanding how far the emasculation of the royal office has come, the monarchical element of our governmental system keeps the principle of inequality alive. It also keeps the principle of non-democratic government — or a democratic government with non-democratic elements — alive. Removing the monarchy will be at our peril.

Additionally, there are worse things that can happen to a country than being a Western democracy. One could easily doubt — with the level to which monarchs have been emasculated — that monarchs will ever intervene, even when the worst crisis or emergency occurs, but there is at least a hope. Yves R. Simon notes:

Although the king of Great Britain and the Scandinavian kings may do little governing, they certainly play a very important part in the political life of their kingdoms. No matter how democratically inclined they may feel, these hereditary presidents of democracies, by the very fact that they are designated not by election but by birth, are nondemocratic characters. Yet few supporters of democracy would wish monarchy to be suppressed in these countries. The almost unanimous opinion is that, under the circumstances, monarchy is useful in several respects — that it is useful, in particular, for the protection of democracy. It is easy to see that by accident (but such accidents are frequent) a nondemocratic principle may serve democracy by holding in check forces fatal to it. One recognized drawback of democratic institutions is that they may occasion sharp strife among parties or factions. When people are sufficiently exhausted by such strife, the situation is ripe for the one-party system and dictatorship. Accordingly, one major need of democracy is protection against the destructive effects of domestic conflicts. That such protection, under definite circumstances, should be best procured by such a nondemocratic factor as a hereditary monarch is perfectly intelligible.

A lot of people see the monarchy as a symbol of subjection, in spite of the history of the republican form of government through the 20th century. The Soviet Union, Mao’s China, and Weimar Germany are examples that tyranny is at least as good a characteristic of republics as that of monarchies — if not more. Liberty has declined in Europe almost in line with the emasculation of its monarchs and the rising esteem of democratic republics. That does not exactly make the republican form of government an icon of liberty.

However, the most convincing argument against this concern with symbols I would draw from the pen of Henrik Ibsen. He wrote to his fellow writer Bjørnson on the issue of ""the pure Norwegian flag."" Ibsen deplored the concept of caring for symbols, ideas, and theories to the extent that progress in practice is not made.

Leave the emasculated monarchs of Europe as they are, save if you are interested in increasing their powers. They do not do much harm. You cannot get a king of your choosing, but you will probably not get a president of your choosing either, unless you consider getting the candidate you voted for among very few as president as your choice.

Care about real progress and not about ""intolerable symbols of subjection."" Let us keep the ""constitutional monarchs"" for ceremonies and emergencies.

742650,"I monitor statements by senior officials of the Federal Reserve System. There are supposedly “hawks” among the regional Federal Reserve banks — privately owned banks. These “hawks” oppose the “doves.” The “doves” are always ready to inflate. The “hawks” are always ready to remind the “doves” that inflation may be a problem one of these days, but not yet. Then the “hawks” vote with the “doves” to expand the monetary base.

If you have not seen a chart of the adjusted monetary base lately, you owe it to yourself. Take a look.

If this chart did not send a chill down your spine, you must work for the Federal Reserve.

In recent weeks, the FED’s party line has become clear. The officials all parrot it. They do not explain it, but they parrot it. Let me summarize.

1. “THERE IS NO THREAT OF INFLATION AT THIS TIME.”

When they say “inflation,” they mean price inflation. The rate of price inflation is measured by various statistical indicators. I have long used the Median Consumer Price Index, which is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. It went up less than the CPI when the CPI moved up. It has not fallen, unlike the most recent CPI. So far in 2009, the Median CPI has moved up, January—April, at 0.2% per month. This is not price deflation, but it is comparatively low by Federal Reserve standards, i.e., too high.

It is safe to say that price inflation is not yet a threat. It is not a threat because the commercial banks are not lending. They are not lending, because bankers all over the world are scared of this economy. They are keeping funds above the legal minimum at their respective central banks. This means that policy-makers at the FED have had little room to maneuver. The federal funds rate is just barely above zero.

Reporters or Congressmen who hear party line #1 should ask this series of questions of Chairman Bernanke: When the recovery arrives, and commercial banks start lending, what will happen to the M1 money multiplier?

Policy positions aside, what follows are characteristics in a person that would serve us very, very well in a President.

1. He tells the truth.

It is not fun to hear that our country is going bankrupt, or that our government is out of control, or that we are losing our liberties at a dizzying rate. It is scary and upsetting. But if we are to regain the country that we like to think we live in, the truth must be heard. Dr. Paul discusses with great frankness the actual reasons for troublesome conditions we now face, and while this may be bitter medicine, it does point the way to reversing the spiral and regaining our footing as a peaceful, free, and prosperous nation.

2. He is unflappable.

When others are in an uproar, Congressman Paul demonstrates a remarkable level of equanimity. On the Tonight Show with Jay Leno (Jan 7th), for example, he discussed FOX's shameless decision to exclude him from their ""Republican debate"" without the slightest hint of rancor or hostility; he even showed a sense of humor. When he has been scoffed at in debates, he has ignored the jeers and gone on to explain his positions in a mild and deliberate manner. This calm demeanor would be a great asset in dealing with the myriad clamorings that make their way into the Oval Office.

3. His story does not change with the political winds.

For many long years, Dr. Paul has been talking about the same crucial topics: sound money; honoring the Constitution; protecting life, liberty and property; friendly relations with other nations and entangling alliances with none; maintaining a strong national defense; honoring our veterans, etc. It doesn't seem to matter where he goes or who is listening — the story remains the same. Wouldn't it be nice to know that the President of the United States had an unswerving commitment to principles of freedom that you could depend upon, once he was in office?

4. He is polite.

If you notice how Dr. Paul behaves in debates, you will see that any annoyance he demonstrates is strictly on policy matters. No matter how much pressure he is under, he is unfailingly polite and respectful, and does not join the game of tossing out rude barbs to trip up or embarrass other candidates. Consider how important might be the simple fact of Presidential good manners in dealing with testy foreign nations.

5. He obeys his oath of office.

When Congressmen (and Presidents) take office, they take the following oath: I, loyal citizen of the Republic, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.” In ten terms in Congress, Dr. Paul has an untarnished record of adhering to this oath. Who else can say that? Nobody. It is, sad to say, practically unheard of. And if we ever needed it in anybody, surely it is in the head of the Executive branch.

6. He is open about what he is doing.

An example of this can be found on Dr. Paul's campaign website, where in prominent display are the totals, minute by minute, of money flowing into his coffers from campaign contributors. I've seen no other candidate do this. It is a small example, perhaps, but it is telling.

7. He is neither owned nor cowed by special interests.

In his years in the House of Representatives, Congressman Paul has proven beyond doubt that he cannot be bought. Lobbyists, I am told, don't even bother trying to get in to see him, since they know that if government funding of their pet projects would be unconstitutional, they are wasting their time. The pressures on a President to bow to powerful interests are sure to be tremendous, and a man who can stand up to them is a very great man indeed.

8. He believes in the America of our Founders.

It has been a slow and painful awakening for some of us to realize that the America in which we now live is not the one our Founders gave us. Sadly, our peace, prosperity and freedom are all under assault. We still have a lot to be thankful for, there is no doubt of that, but we cannot afford to let our freedom keep slipping away, and I want the guy who remembers where we came from and wants to make good the original Revolution.

9. He is modest.

When Congressman Paul talks about his success, he attributes it to the popularity of the ideas he espouses. It is the ideas, not the man, that are carrying this movement, as he has repeatedly said. But the truth is that in the world today, it takes a giant of a man to carry this torch, and he, who is such a man, carries it with grace and modesty. This suggests to me that he cares more for the ideas and for the freedom of his countrymen than he does for his own ambition, and who wouldn't want a President like that?

10. He addresses the issues that matter.

There is always political noise about something, but Dr. Paul cuts under the fray to get at what is causing situations to occur. This sort of approach lends itself to solutions. It is interesting to consider that under a Paul administration, the tide might be reversed, and we might actually regain some of our freedom and prosperity and peace.

11. He is courageous.

If we ever needed a brave man in office, it is now. The pressures that threaten freedom in our land are formidable, and a mere politician, I think, could not stem the tide. Only a statesman could do that, and in Dr. Paul, by the grace of God, we have such a man. Even he could not do it alone, though, and it is heart-warming to see the great numbers of people who are rising up to rally around this cause. This is a movement of historic proportions, and may give us the best chance we'll ever have to restore the foundations of our Republic.

12. He is a nice person.

The President is the first and most public Ambassador of the United States of America. Dr. Paul shows in many ways that he would uphold this responsibility admirably. He demonstrates through example the tenets of his faith (like wanting to treat other nations the way we would like other nations to treat us); he demonstrates professionalism and honesty, scholarship and humor, compassion and integrity. By example alone, he would improve America's standing in the world.

218265,"Statism parades itself in various forms. Most noticeably, it puts a chokehold on individuals through its progressive taxation policies, micro-lawmaking, and ultra-regulation of everyday lives. Yet one of the most creeping ways in which statism affects us directly is in the form of its propaganda.

Every act of state propaganda requires a cause to make it necessary. That cause needs a catchy theme that conveys how one should think about it. As with political polls, the simplified purpose of propaganda is to tell us what to think. Each cause, therefore, requires a crisis — or a perceived crisis — in order for the masses to more readily accept the symbolism disseminated in the name of that cause. And with crisis, fear may be a factor. And currently, in the midst of such disquieting geopolitical volatility, what could be more fear-provoking than the crisis of war?

For instance, the new patriotism that is sweeping the nation is unyielding in its grip on Americans anxious to show their love of country. Terrorism at home and the looming threat of war with insurrectionary jihad makers begets a massive anxiety. And fear, as a rule, tends to be assuaged via a sense of coming together. From the mass-produced ""God Bless America"" signs to pro-USA T-shirts and lapel pins and hats, folks are snapping up this merchandise like mad. They do so because they are told that such actions help to overcome adversity and serve to support the affected. And the state is highly successful in promoting such thoughts. However, all the symbolism proves to be pointless rah-rah that intends support for the government’s actions, whether they are actually sanctioned by the electorate or not.

Nowadays, the ""patriotic"" lip service promoted by the State is eerily reminiscent of that during World Wars I and II, when the Wilson and FDR administrations and their assorted government entities gave rise to a tide of mind-numbing posters meant to instill a sense of duty among citizens devastated by war. WWII propaganda is perhaps more compelling because of its ultimate goal in promoting outright socialism and the building of foreign alliances abroad.

The horrible statism symbolized by WWII-era posters sometimes harped on feel-good themes of doing one’s part and being useful, or they may have even exploited fear by inflating crises and threatening impending disaster. The feel-good propaganda, in particular, played upon the natural inclination people have toward participation and accomplishment, and it boasted of individuals playing their proper role in the war effort; those roles for participants being that of conserving rubber, lumber, petroleum, paper, food and other items that are typically in high demand during times of war. A smiling housewife boasting about her family’s food rationing was intended to provoke a general submissiveness on the part of families toward government diktat. And conserving one’s tires or lumber was a way of having a hand in helping to provide supplies for the boys overseas. All the while, the citizenry was unknowingly mocked into surrender of their individuality and family-first guiding principles. Immediately, one can understand how a move away from such docility could spark a rising independence in society that might no longer mandate a government’s full-blown war.

Other good behavior included abiding by price controls and believing in the ultimate value of such, and certainly, avoiding black markets to serve one’s daily needs. A good American would rather ""do without it"" was the message. And the offices of War Information, Price Administration, and War Food Administration were adept at conveying that meaning.

Another form of efficacy was portrayed in the form of constant production, with hard work being the means to the end of winning the war. After all, who could possibly be against a good work ethic? Increased production called for women to sacrifice domestic bliss for the sake of her men and country. And non—war-bound men were made to sense that they couldn’t work hard enough to overcome the lack of a draft card and military uniform. And the most outlandish State propaganda always assured that those not meeting the demands of the day were, in fact, working for the enemy.

Then there was crisis and disaster. This was always portrayed in the sense of ""you can do something to prevent it."" This theme preyed on the natural human instinct to do all that one could in order to stave off calamity. Loose lips sink ships, we were told, and blabbermouths ultimately killed men directly. And of course, the ultimate catastrophe was for evil to encroach upon American shores and strike us right here at home. WWII propaganda posters are perhaps most memorable in this sense because of the availability of pop-culture villains from which to draw motivation. Mussolini, Stalin, and especially Hitler provided a heap of fodder for the statists.

In 1942, the War Production Board released a series of posters that depict how Hitler was everywhere. According to the propaganda cretins he was in our neighborhoods if we didn’t support the war and in our car if we didn’t carpool. After all, in times of such profound suffering and despair, there had to be ends that individuals and families could strive for to justify the means. The evil images of a Hitler gone mad in our personal spaces conveyed the most deliberate messages of all.

Because this crisis of Hitler in our homes was portrayed as bona fide, American women were often represented as willingly giving their men to the State to die for its war. After all, without the propaganda of encroaching horror to engender absolute fear into a nation of peace-loving people, the State could not possibly expect to be able to clutch loved ones from the home and toss them into harm’s way. Without this ultimate goal from which to convey the necessity of the ultimate sacrifice, a warmaking State would have few subjects from which to garner enough support for ongoing war. Imagine the average American being asked to die for Churchill, or to serve the purpose of U.S. imperialist adventures promoting puppet governments abroad?

Hence, the notion of sacrifice was perhaps the most compelling of all during this time because of the corollary that was presented as the alternative: the squashing of the entire nation by its global enemies. Therefore, the life of one man within the ambit of a gigantic whole was devoid of any parallel worth. FDR socialism was hard at work.

And in a less compelling sense, families were to sacrifice their vacations and save resources for the greater cause. Staying home was said to be beneficial toward the war effort. In fact, it was a great way to contribute by simply doing nothing. An oxymoron, but patriotic nonetheless. In addition, people were convinced to sacrifice laissez-faire commuting plans for car pools. Individuality was entirely eschewed in favor of collective ambitions, as is always the case within the framework of statism.

And lastly, perhaps the most common type of WWII propaganda abounding was that pushing war bonds. Of course, financing a war presented more than just conventional money-raising problems; it also meant that government first needed to acquire a gainful approval rating — from an already overtaxed public — for spending the populace into further debt. Once again, people were instructed how to behave via posters produced by, typically, the United States Treasury or the War Finance Division. Purchasing bonds meant directly supporting the husbands and sons overseas, and spending ten-percent of one’s weekly paycheck was a minimum criterion in order to meet the standards of sufficient patriotism.

All in all, WWII successfully marketed its persuasion upon a willing American audience just waiting to be coerced into thinking something, believing anything, and merely following the Head Persuader.

However, the propagandists must always first build a reputation and credibility, even if they merely feign it as opposed to actually possessing it. After all, persuasion is one of the keys to the democratic process, hence, the revulsion that some of us have to “democracy” and governing by the politicized masses.

Interestingly, Aristotle noted that propaganda (or persuasion) was to be only used by those of good character or good moral standing, otherwise, it ceased to be trustworthy or to have credibility. Modern propaganda as practiced by the State gains its ""credibility"" because, as a precursor to its persuasion tactics, the State has — through its Cradle-to-Grave-role — already exercised a seemingly legitimate form of rule in that they are the final arbiter of all that is significant, from taxes to the military to monopolized goods and services. Therefore, the pre-conditions have been set for a massive campaign of telling people how to think, act, and carry out their daily tasks.

Be aware that the pre-WWII era was a time of isolationist impulse; a time when an entire generation had already experienced world war, and afterwards, only desired to stay home and tend to their domestic lives instead of being dragged off into another series of foreign entanglements. In spite of this, FDR’s various agencies proved masterful in their endeavor to shift the opinions of an entire nation from coveting peace to supporting war.

For war, it seems, had became the norm for the maintenance of a healthy and growing State, and hence, the same propaganda lives on today in a similarly effective role. On balance, shouldn’t we all pull together to prop up our government’s wars?

Coffee sippers who think it might be a good idea to free Tibet from China are about 58 years too late. China is not going to free Tibet, and Western encouragement of Tibetan resistance will only get people killed needlessly.

Tibet was part of China for centuries. In 1913, when China seemed to be falling apart, the British Empire encouraged Tibet to declare its independence. It did, and that lasted until 1950, when, at the end of the Chinese civil war, China invaded and reclaimed the area. By then, the impotent British Empire was in no position to help anyone even if it had been so inclined. America chose to do nothing.

If you are not willing to make your way to the Tibetan plateau and face Chinese guns and prisons, then you certainly should not sit around some coffee shop and urge Tibetans to do so. Tibet is a strategic area of China, and the Chinese government is not going to give it up or grant it independence or even autonomy. To paraphrase a famous outlaw, it is enough that we know that China will do what it has to do.

As for us, we should do nothing. Tibet is part of China, and what happens there is an internal affair of China. The rest of the world has no right to interfere, and other than bloviating for a while, I seriously doubt that it will. Unfortunately, in this age of global communications even bloviating can cause bad things to happen to people.

Boycotting the Olympics is a foolish idea by a tiny minority of fanatics. The Olympics have nothing to do with Tibet, just as they had nothing to do with the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. Boycotting the games would be a cruel blow to athletes who have been sweating and training for four years. It would accomplish nothing. It would further politicize the games, which should be encouraged to return to their amateur status.

China was awarded the Summer Games in a fair international competition and has spent a lot of money getting ready for them. Any attempt to spoil the games will do a great disservice to the athletes, the Chinese government and the Chinese people. It will do nothing positive and will only harden attitudes and end up making the world even more dangerous than it already is.

Americans in particular should keep in mind that we are currently engaged in mismanaging two occupations of two countries that we illegally invaded. Neither enterprise is going well. Neither is our economy. In short, we have enough on our own plate without trying to steal a bite off of China’s plate. We should make sure that Afghanistan and Iran are the last wheezes of the sick American Empire and shut it down and return to our republic.

I don’t know why some Americans seem to have trouble realizing that the days of the European empires are over. Part of the problem is that we have way too many vocational intellectuals and way too few real intellects. A vocational intellectual is someone who makes a living writing or talking. Such people tend to live inside their heads. Delusions of grandeur and fantasies about the real world are constant occupational hazards for such people.

No country in the world has to do what we tell it to do. Certainly that’s the case with the big powers like China, Russia, Japan and India. As you can see every day in your morning paper, even a little country like Iraq can cause us more trouble than it’s worth. It’s a crime against humanity that our sons and daughters are dying in the desert dust while fat politicians cavort about in Washington. Don’t encourage Tibetans to die in some futile fantasy about independence. They are not independent. They are part of China, and part of China they will stay.

501295,"Walter Block’s new book Toward a Libertarian Society covers a wide variety of topics from the death penalty to secession, and from war to macroeconomics. Dr. Block recently spoke with the Mises Institute about just a few of these.

Mises Institute: You say in your book that it is a contradiction in terms to be both libertarian and to be for an aggressive foreign policy. Why is this?

Walter Block: The essence of libertarianism is the non-aggression principle (NAP). This means it is legitimate to use force only in defense, or retaliation, but not to initiate it. However, an aggressive foreign policy is an attempt to export democracy, or the American way of life, or to make things easier for US business, at the point of a gun or a bomb. Thus, this policy necessarily initiates violence against foreigners, but not in defense of their attack on us, nor in retaliation against such. Thus, there is a contradiction. It is as if A were to have the policy of punching B in the nose, where B did not first use violence against A. Clearly, A would be violating the NAP. This is true, however, whether it applies to an individual or a large group, such as a nation. But what about 9-11? Did they not attack us first? No. They were “over here” because we were first “over there.” This was blowback. Had we not stuck our stick into hornet’s nests in that part of the world, they would not have attacked us. They were retaliating against the prior use of force on the part of the US government.

MI: When it comes to the compatibility of libertarianism and labor unions, you say, “it depends.” What does it depend on?

WB: It depends upon whether organized labor violates the NAP. They need not do so in order to pursue their goals, which is an improvement in the wages and working conditions of their members. For they do have one legitimate weapon in their arsenal: the mass quit. If one person goes to the boss demanding improved pay, he is likely to be shown the door. But if he says that all 500 employees will walk out of the factory unless their demands are met, or at least negotiated, the boss is more likely to make a counteroffer. If the union limits itself to this sort of threat, it is entirely legitimate and is acting in accordance with libertarian requirements. However, unions rarely, if ever, limit themselves to a threatened mass quit. They also use violence against those who try to pass through their picket lines, such as replacement workers, or raw materials entering the firm’s property, or finished goods leaving it. It is as if a husband divorces his wife, but they surround her house with his friends who threaten to beat up any potential suitor of hers. Leaving her, a quit, is justified; using violence against competitors, is not.

MI: When it comes to building a better economy, you say that it is production that counts and not jobs. What does this mean?

WB: The goal is not jobs, but the goods and services jobs bring about. If we could have the latter without the former, that is, banish scarcity, all would be lovely. We could play (do whatever we enjoyed) the live-long day. Unfortunately we want more things than is available; that is why we have to work for them. Suppose that the “jobs” consisted of digging holes in the ground, and filling them up again, and that everyone did this and nothing else. At the end of the day, we would have had mass employment, and we would all starve to death because these “jobs” produced nothing to keep us alive.

MI: One should not be surprised at all that you oppose the drug war, but what is the most important reason to oppose the drug war?

WB: There are many reasons to oppose the drug war. It creates havoc in the lives of drug users. It promotes crime. As a result of it, we have all too many people in jail. It is a victimless crime, when limited to consenting adults. But the most important reason to be against it is that the drug war violates the NAP. It uses violence against peaceful users, and entrepreneurs who supply this good to them.

MI: How do you cure poverty? What is the best short answer to this question when a non-libertarian asks about it?

WB: A very short answer is: promote private property rights, laissez faire capitalism, and the NAP of libertarianism. A longer answer would mention the fact that in the free enterprise system, the only way to become wealthy (that is, cure poverty), is to engage in commercial interaction. But this necessarily improves the well-being of all parties to the exchange. Whenever Bill Gates sold a computer to someone for $$500, that person valued it at The Case for Discrimin... Walter Block Check Amazon for Pricing. more than this amount, otherwise he would not have purchased it; and it cost Bill Gates less than that figure to produce the computer. Otherwise, he would have gone broke. Each and every commercial transaction, buying, selling, renting, bartering, borrowing, lending, employing, etc., is mutually beneficial at least in the ex antesense of anticipations (we engage in the market since we expect to gain thereby). Free enterprise is necessarily in this sense a wealth creating institution. How else can poverty be cured, but by creating wealth?

MI: You’ve also written extensively on environmentalism and free markets. Without government, wouldn’t we all have to drink filthy water and breathe dirty air?

WB: Private property rights, along with the NAP, are the two sides of the libertarian coin. Both are essential. But what is pollution, whether air or water borne, other than a trespass of smoke and dust particles onto the property, and into the lungs, of other people? The government unfortunately, for many years, has not allowed people to sue each other for such trespasses. If they had allowed this to occur, the challenge of filthy water and dirty air would have long ago been overcome.

462687,"Recently by Ben O’Neill: Doing Your Own Thing

Several months ago, I was visiting some friends in Sydney and was invited to the house of a friend-of-a-friend for some late night drinks and a chat. My host and his friends were left-wing bohemian types and had been informed by my friend that I am a ""free-market anarchist,"" or something like that. They found this notion intriguing, and so they quizzed me on what that means, and this naturally led into a discussion of the merits of a free market versus a democracy.

The discussion was a cordial one, and went as most of these discussions do when one is chatting with people who have never previously been exposed to consistent libertarian philosophy. My host and his friends raised most of the standard objections to the free market and to the idea of a stateless private-law society, and I explained why I regard each of those objections as erroneous.[1] Though the attending group appeared to find my arguments on these individual points thought provoking, they remained unconvinced. The main sticking point to the discussion was a pervasive concern that the free market does not allow for democratic state action  that ""the people"" should have the right to collectively determine ""the rules of the game"" by voting their preferred politicians into power, and that their determinations should legitimately bind the members of the society they are in.

The Sanction of the Victims

This discussion would have been fairly routine  much like countless similar discussions I have had on these issues before  except for one interesting peculiarity. As I argued for the virtues of noncoercion as a governing principle for society, and my host and his friends rallied in favor of unlimited democracy, every one of them happened to be concurrently occupying themselves by snorting lines of cocaine through their rolled-up monopoly-issued fiat currency. (They graciously offered me some, but my recreational drug of choice is alcohol, so I declined.) This gave the discussion an interesting tinge that illustrates an important aspect of people’s love affair with mob rule: ""Does it bother any of you,"" I asked them, ""that under your own preferred political system you’re all considered criminals? What you’re doing right now is considered a crime, and you could be fined or even go to prison for it.""

The answer was no; it didn’t bother them. It doesn’t really bother anyone who accepts mob rule as a desirable form of social organization. The reason is that democrats never regard existing democracy as their preferred political system  they regard it only as a transitory state to a democratic utopia in which the elected leaders will agree totally with their own values and social-political views. Mises has observed that ""the critics of the capitalistic order always seem to believe that the socialistic system of their dreams will do precisely what they think correct.""[2] Hence, when people talk about the importance of democracy, it is never democracy as it has ever actually functioned, with the politicians that have actually been elected, and the policies that have actually been implemented. It is always democracy as people imagine it will operate once they succeed in electing ""the right people""  by which they mean, people who agree almost completely with their own views, and who are consistent and incorruptible in their implementation of the resulting policies. This is what allows an intelligent group of people to espouse mob rule as a desirable principle, even as they simultaneously commit acts that brand them as criminals worthy of imprisonment under the very social system they maintain.

Ayn Rand referred to this phenomenon[3] as the ""sanction of the victim""  a person can occupy himself snorting lines of cocaine in his own home, while simultaneously accepting the view that it is morally proper for those in his society to use violence against him if they catch him doing it. The reason for this is a mistaken view in the desirability and moral legitimacy of mob rule as a governing principle for society. With this in mind, let us examine the real nature of this much-lauded democracy.

Unlimited Democracy Is a Form of Socialism

Democracy, of the unlimited kind lauded today,[3] is a form of socialism, in the sense that it arrogates ultimate power over all decisions to the government. Implicit in the notion of people’s present love affair with mob rule is the assumption that government, through the collective ""will of the people,"" should have the prerogatives of ownership of all resources in society, should it choose to exercise these. The democrat brooks no limitation on the legitimate powers of government and hence gives total ownership over all of society to this institution. The only limitation in his mind is the limitation of democracy itself  that the rulers in control of the government apparatus must guard against being displaced by another set of rulers, at the behest of the demands of the mob.

The socialistic nature of democracy is true regardless of the size of governments elected under a democratic order or their particular policies. It is true even when a democratic government chooses policies that are relatively liberal and purportedly support the ownership of private property. For such property ownership is regarded as conditional. Supporters of the system of democracy assert their right to forcibly interfere in the lives of others whenever they have sufficient support from the mob to do so, or are otherwise capable of capturing political power. By supporting the existence of a democratic order they implicitly sanction an arrogation of ultimate ownership of all society to the government, whether decisions over particular resources are exercised by government or not.

Any private property or personal autonomy allowed under democracy exists only with the permission of the government, and under the constant threat of the whims of the mob, rather than existing as a recognized enforceable moral right against the government. The ideal of democracy dictates that a person’s private rights are always subject to being overruled by the government, and so it is actually the government that is the implicit owner of all the resources (and people) in its territory. Such a society is implicitly socialist in character, unless and until people reject the legitimacy of government power over their resources, a view which requires the rejection of mob rule as a governing principle.

The fact that most democratic governments ban the possession, trade, and consumption of cocaine  and treat those who engage in these activities as criminals  is just one minor corollary to the implicit assumption that democratic government owns you. Those in control of the government don’t need to worry too much if you disagree with their ""public policies,"" so long as you concede the legitimacy of their power to impose these policies on you. It is not enough to dislike or disagree with their specific programs  to attain genuine enforceable rights, people need to reject the moral legitimacy of government interference in their lives.

Do Not Consent to Be Ruled

Those who support democracy tend to conflate the issue of the method of selection of rulers with the preliminary question of whether political power is legitimate in the first place. Hence, it needs to be clearly understood that objection to democratic rule does not mean that one prefers dictatorship  it means than one does not consent to have others initiate force against them, regardless of the method of selection of those with the power to do this. Indeed, one may quite rightly prefer democracy to dictatorship while still regarding both of these systems as inferior to a society without political rulers.

If you are inclined to believe that democracy will function justly when ""the right people"" are elected, then bear in mind that each political party is elected precisely because its candidates are regarded as the best people available by the majority at the time. Look around you at the people who are elected, and look at the actions of these people. This is your democracy, and the destruction and domination occurring under its imprimatur are the natural consequences of the view that the desires of the mob should override the rights of the individual.

When chatting about this issue with my hosts over late-night drinks, I was one-too-many beers away from sobriety to put the case well. But if I had mustered the presence of mind to do so, I would have told them that instead of concerning themselves with how their rulers should be chosen, they have another choice available to them: reject the idea that you require rulers at all!

Most people don’t spend their Friday nights snorting lines of cocaine. But virtually every adult person contravenes the ubiquitous regulations of democratic government at many times in their life. And regardless of their actions, everyone living under unlimited democracy is treated as the property of the government, with rights that are disposable at the whims of the mob. Under democracy, everyone is subject to the rule of any group that can acquire large numbers and become adept at capturing political power.

People still have not absorbed the lesson of democracy that should have been learned when Socrates was condemned to death by his fellow Athenians for his impiety.[5] Might is not right: whether expressed through raw physical power or through the voting booth, it is illegitimate and undesirable for people to aggress against their fellow human beings. Rejecting the rule of the mob is an important step towards peace and prosperity.

Notes

[1] Objections included the assertion that free competition leads to giant corporate monopolies, the claim that big corporations would rule the world, the notion that private protection providers would form organized-crime groups akin to the Mafia, the delusion that poor people would die in the streets for want of food and medical care, and a host of other objections that have been refuted ad nauseam in libertarian works too numerous and diverse to mention. I do not provide answers to these arguments here, though they can easily be found in other literature.

[3] Rand’s reference to the ""sanction of the victim"" was used to refer more specifically to the fact that victims supply the tools of their own destruction to their destroyers, who are incapable of production themselves. Though Rand would not have regarded cocaine consumption as a productive activity that provides tools to one’s destroyers, she did regard the moral sanction of the victim as being a necessary tool supplied to one’s destroyers. It is in this sense that I use the term.

[4] Most democratic states today maintain some form of constitution that purports to limit their powers. However, these are increasingly strained by the widespread acceptance of unlimited democracy as a political ideal, and by the capacity of the elected executive government to choose the judicial officers who interpret this alleged limiting device. In fact, no such device can limit the power of government in its own right, because it is an instrument of public law itself and is administered by government officials. Events in democratic countries repeatedly demonstrate that such constitutions exert no real constraint on the power of government, even when the ruling officials in government act in ways that are unmistakably in conflict with the prohibitions in these documents.

Questions raised by Koenig and Lendman call to mind Operation Gladio. Gladio is the codename for a secret NATO operation set up by Washington after WWII as a result of fear that the Red Army would overrun Western Europe. Originally Gladio consisted of hidden arms caches and an organization to conduct a guerrilla war against the Soviet occupying army.

Myths, Misunderstandings and Outright lies about owning Gold. Are you at risk?

Instead of a Soviet Invasion, the threat that emerged was the popularity of the Communist Party in France and especially Italy. Washington was fearful that communist parties would win enough votes to form a government and that Washington’s Western European Empire would be breached as these communist governments aligned with Moscow.

Consequently, Gladio was turned against the European communist parties. The Italian intelligence service together with the CIA began bombing public places in Italy, such as the Bologna train station in which 285 people were killed, maimed, and otherwise wounded.

Gladio operative Vincenzo Vinciguerra first revealed Gladio’s existence during his 1984 trial for the bombing of the Bologna train station in 1980. Questioned about the Bologna bombing, Vinciguerra said:

“There exists in Italy a secret force parallel to the armed forces, composed of civilians and military men, in an anti-Soviet capacity that is, to organize a resistance on Italian soil against a Russian army…A secret organization, a super-organization with a network of communications, arms, and explosives, and men trained to use them…A super-organization which, lacking a Soviet military invasion which might not happen, took up the task, on NATO’s behalf, of preventing a slip to the left in the political balance of the country. This they did, with the assistance of the official secret services and the political and military forces.”

It was not until 6 years later, 1990, that the prime minister of Italy, Giulio Andreotti, officially acknowledged the existence of Gladio.

Italian General Gerardo Serravalle commanded Italy’s Gladio’s participation in the first half of the 1970s. Wikipedia reports that he testified that those responsible for planning and coordination “were the officers responsible for the secret structures of Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, and Italy. These representatives of the secret structures met every year in one of the capitals… At the stay-behind meetings, representatives of the CIA were always present.”

There were many bombings with many civilian casualties from the 1960s through the mid-1980s. Vinciguerra said: How America Was Lost: ... Paul Craig Roberts Best Price: $$9.89 Buy New $$19.90 (as of 07:35 EST - Details)

“You were supposed to attack civilians, women, children, innocent people outside the political arena, for one simple reason–to force the Italian public to turn to the state, turn to the regime and ask for greater security. . . . This is the political logic behind all the bombings. They remain unpunished because the State cannot condemn itself.”

The bombings were blamed on communist terrorist groups, such as the Red Brigades and the Baader-Meinhof gang, groups that might have been real or invented intelligence covers to aid the discrediting of European communist parties.

In 1984 Judge Felice Casson reopened a 12-year-old case of a car bomb in Peteano, Italy. The judge found that the case had been falsified and blamed on the Red Brigades, but had actually been the work of the military secret service, Servizio Informazioni Difesa (SID) in conjunction with Ordine Nuovo, a right-wing organization created or co-opted by Gladio. The police official who falsified the investigation was sentenced to prison. Judge Casson’s investigation concluded that the Peteano bombing was part of a series of bombings carried out by Gladio including the Milano Piazza Fontane bombing, which killed 16 and injured 80, and the 1980 Bologna railway station bombing, which killed 85 and injured 200.

Based on the Italian revelations, Belgium and Swiss governments undertook investigations of Gladio operations in those countries. The United States government has denied any participation in the bombings. However, Judge Casson’s search of the archives of the Italian military secret service turned up proof of the existence of the Gladio network and links to NATO and the United States.

Western peoples whose democracies have degenerated into plutocracies are inoculated against the belief that the government would kill its own citizens. Clearly, they need to learn about operation Gladio.

Is Operation Gladio still alive and well? The terror events of today are blamed on Muslims instead of on communists. Is it possible that the terror attacks in France and Belgium are Gladio operations?

Addendum:

This large collection of photos from the UK Daily Mail of the Nice attack does not seem to show any blood in the streets where the carnage is reported to have happened or any blood associated with what are reported to be bodies. The white truck that is reported to be the murder weapon does not seem to show any blood or damage. A colleague once hit a deer, and his car was totaled. How can there be 186 people hit and no damage to the truck? Also, among the photos is a video of police standing exposed a few feet from the truck cab firing into the cab. For the police to expose them to a lunatic reported to be armed implies that he wasn’t armed or that the truck cab was empty. Why didn’t the police just open the door and capture him, or if he was armed wait until his pistol ran out of ammunition? In all of these attacks, the alleged perpetrator is always killed. Note also that already there are names and photos of the victims and a history of the perpetrator. How can so many photos of so many different people be so quickly collected and so much information collected about the perpetrator? The media never ask public authorities such questions or ever provide answers. It seems the story is prepared and ready to go when the event occurs, and that story is all we ever get.

And what do we make of this. Why would armed French troops on the scene capable of stopping the Bataclan carnage be told to stand down?

225108,"There are not many Hollywood movies that can be called openly libertarian. There are occasional movies that might be called closet libertarian. Think of this review as outing one of them.

Wild River was a financial flop, unlike most of Kazan’s other films in the 1950’s: A Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, and East of Eden. It received little attention at the time, and it has not been revived as a cult classic, unlike Kazan’s A Face in the Crowd (1957). I think this is because the film’s theme is too foreign for modern film reviewers.

It is the story of the building of the Tennessee Valley Authority’s system of dams. It takes place in the mid-1930’s. It begins with newsreel footage of a flood on the Tennessee River.

Montgomery Clift plays a TVA bureaucrat whose job is to persuade an 80-year-old matriarch to sell her island in the middle of the river. She had refused so far, despite the arguments of previous bureaucrats. The TVA is running out of time to clear the land of trees. It does not want to evict her by force . . . yet. It would be bad publicity. Ethics has nothing to do with the TVA’s reticence to foreclose and evict.

The matriarch is played by Jo Van Fleet, who made a career of playing women decades her senior. Her scene as the dying mother of Paul Newman in Cool Hand Luke is memorable. Her less known scene as an Italian matriarch in The Gang that Couldn’t Shoot Straight has this classic line: “If it’s not in the Daily News, there wasn’t no murder.” But nothing she did matches her role as Ella Garth.

In one scene in the film, the bureaucrat tries to persuade her that the dams will bring progress, including electricity. She is buying none of it. She sees this as the destruction of her way of life. Finally, she challenges him: “You can get me off by force, I reckon. It won’t take much force, but it will take some.” The scene is here.

Later in the film, she stages a scene for the bureaucrat. It is not clear to him or the viewer at first exactly what is going on. She has a confrontation with a black man, one of dozens who do all the work on her island, which is a low-income plantation.

She confronts the man. She says she wants to buy his dog. He refuses to sell. She offers him $$15, which in the rural South in the Great Depression was a lot of money. He refuses. She asks him if the price is fair. He says the dog is not worth much, but he refuses to sell.

Then she ups the ante. She tells him that she is going to take his dog, so he might as well take her money. He still refuses.

She then tells the bureaucrat that this is what ownership is all about. She walks away, having made her point.

I have never seen property rights defended any more clearly on screen. She initially comes off as a die-hard remnant of the ante-bellum South. But it is clear at the end of this staged confrontation that race is not the issue for her, nor is power. It is the right to say “no” when someone says he is going to buy your property.

The uncredited actor who plays the dog’s owner was Robert Earl Jones, James Earl Jones’ father. Also uncredited is Bruce Dern, in his first movie role. He plays the familiar Bruce Dern character: a sniveling slimeball bully. He was typecast early in his career.

It is worth noting that a quarter century later, Mel Gibson starred in The River (1984), a movie about a family farmer trying to make a living at the edge of a Tennessee river, which periodically floods the region. You mean the TVA had not solved the flooding problem after all? You mean that farmers buy low-priced land that occasionally floods, because that is all they can afford? You mean that people take risks if the price is right? At least everyone had electricity. It makes declaring bankruptcy more comfortable.

215419,"The

Enron scandal may administer the coup de grace to the public accounting

profession. Already last rites are being said for Arthur Andersen,

one of the big five accounting firms. Andersen is under siege after

destroying crucial documents relating to the Enron audit

There

are two scenarios being banded about concerning the future of private

auditing firms. At one extreme, optimistic pundits refuse to believe

that Andersen is history. They predict that the firm can clean house,

restructure, change its name and survive. Also, partners at other

firms will realize that their bending of rules to pacify large clients

cannot continue. So public accounting will rise from the ashes like

the phoenix.

However,

the other extreme being alluded to is what frightens me. Some are

saying that government will use this scandal as an excuse to assume

all auditing functions. Of course, it would be difficult for the

government to pass up an opportunity like this. They could seize

the moment and expand their power even further. We can only cross

our fingers and hope this doesn' t happen.

But

what would auditing be like if the Federal government performed

it? Bear in mind that the function would be administered, not by

elected officials but by entrenched bureaucrats who survive from

administration to administration. Today's bureaucrats operate under

the philosophy of political correctness and its three principles:

egalitarianism, diversity and multiculturalism. Temporarily assuming

the mindset of a Washington bureaucrat I can give you a preview

of some of the changes in auditing that might occur.

Bureaucrats

would contend that anyone who can pass a civil service test could

perform any audit function required. Therefore they would not hire

CPA u2018s and would claim that the CPA exam is biased in favor of those

who have studied accounting. But those with no accounting training

would be at a disadvantage so the egalitarian principle would be

violated.

Also,

the AICPA's Financial Accounting Standards Board would have to be

restructured. This Board has been comprised primarily of white males

and, since white males have a history of oppressing women and minorities,

the Board's pronouncements would be suspect. In addition, their

strict rules regarding accounting practices inhibit creativity,

which is necessary for people to achieve a feeling of psychological

self-worth.

The

Financial Accounting Standards Board would be restaffed with people

from diverse ethnic and cultural groups as well as those who have

been held back as result of a discriminatory society. The symbolism

of such a group is important enough to sacrifice correct accounting

standards.

Because

some government auditors may not be fluent in English, companies

would be required to keep a separate set on books in Spanish and

maybe a third set in another language. In the future, when vision

impaired auditors are added to the staff, companies will have to

create a set of records utilizing braille.

However,

this change will not be implemented immediately because of the unfavorable

publicity the government received as a result of its experiment

with blind nurses. The blind nurse who mistakenly assumed a visitor

was the patient and forced her onto a bedpan against her will caused

quite a controversy. But this was an isolated incident and shouldn't

be used to prohibit blind auditors.

The

government will probably not use a manager to supervise an audit

because this would imply that some auditors are better than others.

So each auditor would operate on his own, deciding for himself which

part of the audit he will perform. If two auditors choose the same

part, the matter will be referred to a government arbitration committee.

The audit will be postponed until the committee meets and makes

a decision.

We

must understand that some people are not good with numbers but that

shouldn't preclude them from being a government auditor. However,

they may not be able to balance a balance sheet and their inability

to do so would be stressful and lower their self-esteem. So the

newly staffed Financial Accounting Standards Board would replace

the traditional balance sheet with a new concept, the ""Partially

Balanced Balance Sheet.""

A

Statement of Income implies that an entrepreneur sold his products

for more than it cost him to produce them. This is malevolent capitalism

which the government hates. In fact, according to Washington, the

only positive thing corporations do is pay taxes. So the Financial

Accounting Standards Board would change the Statement of Income

to the ""Statement of Provision for Future Taxes"".

Finally

we come to the all-important Accountant's Report wherein the auditor

renders his opinion on the financial statements: do they fairly

represent the financial position of the company? But we are living

in a non-judgmental environment where all opinions have equal value

except for politically correct opinions which take precedence over

all others.

So

the Accountant's Report would read: ""We have audited the accompanying

Partially Balanced Balance Sheet as well the Statement of Provision

for Future Taxes of XYZ Company for the year ended December 31,

2002. However, it would be politically incorrect for us to imply

that our opinion of these statements should be held in higher regard

than the opinion of others. Each reader of this report should, based

on their gender, ethnic affiliation and environmental circumstance,

form their own opinion regarding the financial position of XYZ Company.""

457223,"The high point of the American Empire has passed and mercifully we have emerged intact from the 20 very dangerous years during which the United States was the sole superpower in the world. We must never allow ourselves to endure that trial again. Power in the world is now passing to the East, to China, to Russia and to other rising nations as the United States is an aging tiger whose teeth are falling out. This was stated in an interview which outspoken and brutally honest British MP George Galloway granted to the Voice of Russia’s John Robles. With regard to US surrogate NATO which is circling both Russia and China with bases and nuclear weapons, he labeled it an “imperial war machine” and called it “the greatest danger to peace and security in the world.” Mr. Galloway was also candid on his assessment of Saudi Arabia which he called a “gangster state” with Prince Bandar acting as chief capo who delivers severed horse’s heads into the bed of whomsoever they wish to intimidate. As for Ukraine Mr. Galloway put the situation into stark perspective by saying: “Can you imagine what would happen if President Putin went to the streets of Toronto on street demonstrations whipping up anti-American feeling, in neighboring country. And yet this is precisely what is happening on the front line in Kiev now,” he added; again President Putin has again played a masterful diplomatic game. As for declining US hegemony he stated: “… they are losing and losing and losing. … they are losing because their power is waning, because hard power is waning, their financial power is defunct and their soft power, their cultural power is virtually non-existent. Anyone who takes a look at John McCain and thinks that that is a cultural soft power icon to desire, to head towards, would need their head examined. This is knuckle-dragging, low grade moronic culture,” he stated.

This is John Robles, you are listening to an interview with George Galloway, a member of the British Parliament. This is part 3 of an interview in progress. You can find the previous parts of this interview on our website at voiceofrussia.com

Part 1

Part 2

Robles: Another country that, I just want to add to your list, was Saudi Arabia when Prince Bandar threatened terrorist attacks on the Olympic Games in Sochi. Russia would have had every right to just wipe it off the map.

Galloway: Well, Saudi Arabia is a gangster state and Bandar is increasingly the chief capo. He is the man who goes around delivering the severed horse’s headinto the bed of whomsoever they wish to intimidate.

They try bribery first of all and then they try browbeating, and finally they are ready to bully through the use of their surrogate auxiliary terrorist army.

And they found that President Putin could be neither bribed nor bullied, and he was sent away with a flea in his ear. But he was very lucky; it was only a flea in his ear. Frankly if he’d tried it with me he’d have gone home without an ear.

Robles: Yeah, I mean, you don’t threaten a nuclear superpower, I’m sorry, the West can say whatever they want but Russia is still a nuclear power. You don’t tell a president: “We are going to unleash Al Qaeda; we control your Chechen terrorists”. What about Scotland? You are Scottish, yes, sir?

Galloway: Yes, I am, yes.

Robles: What about Scottish independence? Do you think that will happen? How is it going?

Galloway: I don’t think it will happen and I don’t want it to happen. I’m against the breakup of states. This small country has been one country for more than 300 years. We speak the same language, we have a common language, a common culture, a common economic situation and once upon a time, if only briefly, we did some good things in the world, particularly in 1940 and 1941 when we stood alone against Fascist barbarism,and we didn’t ask the people who did so whether they were Scottish or whether they were English.

And I just think that working people divided are always weakened, working people together will be stronger. So, I was against the breakup of Yugoslavia, I was against the breakup of the USSR, I can hardly be in favor of the breakup of this small country.

Robles: Ok. Can you give us your opinion of sovereignty in the EU with regard to, for example, Ukraine and how much do countries lose in terms of sovereignty in your opinion when they join the EU?

Galloway: Before I answer that, let me just make this point. Can you imagine what would happen if President Putin went to the streets of Toronto on street demonstrations whipping up anti-American feeling, in neighboring country. And yet this is precisely what is happening on the front line in Kiev now. European and North American politicians are on the streets of Russia’s neighboring country whipping up anti-Russian feeling. But it seems to me, maybe I’m wrong – you will know better than I – but it’s running out of steam.

Again President Putin with his economic arrangements that he has now made with the President of Ukraine has again played a masterful diplomatic game. And the European Union, virtually bankrupt, is not in a position to match what Russia can do to help Ukraine in this terrible economic situation that it is in.

But to answer your point, the European Union is a good idea in principle. It has stopped the countries of the west of Europe in the first instance, from attacking each other, and murdering each other in their millions, which they did from 1870 until 1945, three times at least. And that is a good thing.

It is a good thing if working people in the European continent, not only within the boundaries of the European Union but throughout the European continent, can reach a common agreements on social policy, on environmental issues, on issues of social security and even common defense. There is nothing wrong with any of these things.

But the European Union is utterly dysfunctional when it comes to the manner in which it is run and the free market banking principles on which it is based.

We have a Reganite-Thatcherite European Central Bank which sets monetary and fiscal policy for the Franco-German center and not for the periphery even of Western Europe, never mind Central and Eastern Europe as they become more often members of the European Union.

So it is a very dysfunctional organization, it is broke and it ought to fix its own problems rather than sticking its nose into the problems of Ukraine and the Ukraine’s relationship with Russia.

Robles: I see. And by extension – NATO, what is your opinion about NATO and their expansion?

Galloway: Well, NATO is an imperial war machine; its name is increasingly of course a misnomer. The North Atlantic has been stretched as a geographical definition as far as the desserts of North Africa. And the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is circling both Russia and China with bases and nuclear armed warships and airplanes and so on. And it is the greatest danger to peace and security in the world.

And one of the many reasons why I find the call for Scottish independence implausible is that the Independence Party plans on making the independent Scotland a member of NATO which makes a mockery of its professed intention to be rid of nuclear weapons. You cannot be rid of nuclear weapons whilst joining a nuclear armed club.

Robles: Do you see NATO weakening or just growing and growing beyond all control?

Galloway: No, no, they are definitely weakening. The high point of the American Empire has passed as the high point of the British Empire before it passed.

Power is passing to the East, to China, to Russia and to other rising countries in the East and the South. I wouldn’t say as Chairman Mao said 30 years or 40 years, prematurely, that the United States was a paper tiger, but it is definitely an aging tiger whose teeth are beginning to fall out.

Robles: I see. Very well put, thank you sir – brilliant.

Galloway: Thank you.

Robles: If I could last, very last point and then I’ll let you go: Ukraine, right; Syria, we think Ukraine it was like revenge for their loss in Syria, right? Now if they lose in Ukraine what is the next hot spot going to be in your opinion?

Galloway: Well, the thing is they are losing and losing and losing. Now that might make them more angry but it doesn’t make them more able to win. They are losing because they are losing, they are losing because their power is waning, because hard power is waning, their financial power is defunct and their soft power, their “cultural power” is virtually non-existent.

Anyone who takes a look and a listen to John McCain and thinks that that is a cultural soft power icon to desire, to head towards, would need their head examined. This is knuckle-dragging, low grade moronic culture. And I don’t think that the great people of the Ukraine or in many other places are attracted to the soft power of the United States. The United States doesnot have the financial and economic wherewithal to make it worth their while.

So people are increasingly looking to themselves I hope, and looking elsewhere to other rising powers in the world. And let’s hope that in the next year and the next decade we have a number of great powers in the world.

Mercifully we have emerged intact from the very dangerous twenty years in which the United States was the sole superpower in the world, we escaped that and we must never allow ourselves to endure that trial again.

Robles: I see. Can we finish up with your film? Can you give us a few details maybe plug it if you want to, tell us where can we go.I understand, your film its very unique in that it’s being funded by the people.

Galloway: Yes, the Killing of Tony Blair began on Kickstarter, which is a crowd-funding mechanism. We asked for £50,000 and we got £160,000. And the money is still coming in, it can’t come in now by Kickstarter but you can still support us through PayPal, you can go to theblairdoc.com.

You can follow us on Twitter at the @TheBlairDoc. There are many many ways, if you forget any of those, just go to George Galloway MP on Facebook or follow me @George Galloway on Twitter and I’ll put you in the right direction. The film should be out next autumn, and it is coming to a cinema near you.

Robles: OK. I’m sure it will be very popular in Russia; hopefully we can get a Russian version.

Galloway: I hope so. Thanks very much indeed, John.

Robles: Ok, thank you, sir, it was an honor and a pleasure, and thanks for your time.

Galloway: My pleasure, my pleasure, thanks, bye.

Robles: Ok, bye-bye.

459837,"As America celebrates its 240th anniversary of independence from Britain, Texas’ and California’s campaigns to secede from the US have been given a kiss of life. But are they really ready to follow #Brexit and revive their bids to break away from Washington.

#Texit #Texodus

Right after the Brexit success, people in Texas began pushing for a ‘Texit’– a Texas split from the USA – on social media.

To explain why Texas should secede from the Union, Twitter users showed the map of EU and outlined the area of the Lone Star State. And it looks rather impressive.

Current Prices on popular forms of Silver Bullion

Others even suggested a better hashtag for a Texas exit: #Texodus, a portmanteau of ‘Texas’ plus ‘exodus’, the migration of Jews from Egypt.

Texas was the 28th state to join the Union in 1845, following nine years as an independent republic. According to speculation from the Texas Nationalist Movement, the state could exit the US as early as 2018.

“In the Brexit vote, the people of UK felt that they were paying more into EU than were getting out of it. And it’s exactly as it is here in Texas,” Daniel Miller, President of the TNM, told RT.

According to Miller, there is a sense locally that the best people to govern Texas are Texans.

Boasting 261,231 supporters on its website, TNM is calling for more Texans to join and bring pressure on Texas Governor Greg Abbott to allow a vote on independence from the US and its “sprawling Federal bureaucracy.”

And based on its present day $$1.6 trillion economy, if it did become a separate nation, it would be among the 10 top economies in the world, Miller said.

The group has more likes on Facebook than the Texas Democratic Party, one of the two major political parties in Texas, with 211,000 ‘likes’ compared to 133,000.

#Calexit #Caleavefornia

And Texas is not alone when it comes to following the Brexit example – some in California, the most populous US state, are ready to split, too.

The ‘Yes, California’ Twitter community, which leads the campaign for the Golden State to secede from the United States, already compared the size of California to the EU.

Against the State: An ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr. Best Price: $$3.89 Buy New $$9.95 (as of 08:00 EST - Details) “We are here in California subsidizing the other states of this union,” Louis J. Marinelli, president of the Yes, California independence campaign, told RT. “As a result, we are losing tens, sometimes hundreds of billions of dollars every year” to other states.

Thus, Californians don’t have enough to improve healthcare or education, he added.

“We did an informal poll. We asked 9,000 Californians: ‘Should California become an independent country?’ And our response at that time was 41 percent said ‘Yes’. That’s why we take so much encouragement after what happened in the Brexit vote,”he added.

Some 7,000 users ‘like’ Yes California on Facebook. The group is organizing a California Independence Rally on the 166th Anniversary of Californian ‘Statehood’ September 9.

California officially joined the US back in 1850, becoming its 31st state.

Yet California and Texas are not the only US states eager to exit the union.

Native Americans, who have long struggled for independence status in the US, proposed their own Republic of Lakotah back in 2007. It is, in fact, a virtual state which covers some 200,000 sq km and includes territories of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming and Montana. Kids TEXAS SECEDE Tshi...

In the meantime, the Alaskan Independence Party (AIP) has been calling to quit the US since the 1980s. There is also the so-called Cascadian movement in the US and Canada, which calls to form a country consisting of Washington, Oregon, and portions of other US states, as well as British Columbia, Canada.

Hawaii, the most recent state of the US, which received statehood back in 1959, has also had its own independence movements since the 1960s. One of them, the Hawaiian sovereignty movement, says that the archipelago’s annexation was illegal.

However, according to Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, the exit of states from the US, and Texit in particular, won’t happen.

“A state couldn’t legally force the US to let it secede if the US refused. But if the state and the US agreed, that would be doable. At worst, it would require a constitutional amendment, but most likely an act of Congress, coupled with a majority referendum that the state government views as binding, would suffice,” Volokh told the Dallas Observer

He added that “most Texans ….are proud to be Americans, whether or not they like what the federal government is doing, and they can see the benefits of remaining part of a powerful country that can defend their interests.”

And the rest of the world wonders if they will ever get back together. Who cares? This is cultural depravity revisited. (Actually, depravity never left Hollywood.) Story is, they were off to Vermont to celebrate their lesbian marriage-to-be, and would follow up by “having a baby together”. Apparently, Ellen wanted Anne to carry the baby, but Anne was not so sure that was her job (But Anne, you can’t expect the [man] to carry the child!)

If this break-up means I’ll never again have to look at Ellen and Anne on the cover of the Enquirer while in long lines at the supermarket, Hallelujah! As far as Ellen goes, I would put her back in the closet, lock it, feed her parakeet seeds under the crack of the door, set up a church organist and choir outside the door that would play church hymns endlessly, make her write “I think Mel Gibson is handsome” 1000 times on a sheet of paper, pipe Rush Limbaugh’s radio show into the closet at a very loud volume, and send in an FBI tank like the one used at Waco to “keep her at bay”. At least until Anne Heche finds a boyfriend — which she will. To those who followed her romantic endeavors in the pre-Ellen days, she likes men. She doesn’t have the “gene.” Go for it, Anne.

Whoever gave women the idea that they look good in brush-cuts? Maybe it’s just in the Midwest, but summer seems to bring on a slew of ladies with the prickly ""do"". Ok, hair prep time can really put a dent in one’s morning. But beauty comes at some price, eh? Rudy on “survivor” looks good in a brush-cut. 25-year-old police officers look good in brush-cuts. Naval officers look good in brush-cuts. If these cuts were considered so stylish for women, then why don’t TV anchors and beauty contestants wear them? Case closed.

Michigan’s favorite feel-good election signs are popping up all over the front lawns of suburban Detroit again this year. They read: ""Education, Jobs, Health Care: Democrats Care!"" Oh brother.

Gotta love those one-dimensional bumper stickers that say “I [blankety-blank-blank], and I vote!” I want one that says, “I’m not a soccer Mom, and I vote!”

“Everybody does it” (the media argued during the Clinton-Lewinsky debacle). They claimed many Presidents, including Washington, Reagan and Bush wandered sexually. “Ronald Reagan was quite a man about Hollywood.” The only problem is, he doesn’t remember!

Not my original, but one of my favorite jokes I heard Rush Limbaugh tell many years ago (WARNING for leftists — religious overtones): One day, God came down and announced the end of the world. Of course, newspaper headlines reflected this very fact the next morning. The USA Today printed big color pictures, explicit graphics, and cut-away views of a world blown to bits along with the headline, ""We’re All Dead!"" The New York Times printed this headline, ""God Said World to End Tomorrow! See page 17A"" The Wall Street Journal printed this headline, ""God Has Said the World Will End Tomorrow u2014 Market To Close Early!"" The Washington Post reported this headline, ""God Said World to End Tomorrow u2014 Women and Minorities Hit Hardest!"" [This being my own personal addition to the joke, the Detroit Free Press would say, “God Permanently Oppressing Entire World: Now We Are Certain He Is A White, European Male.”]

Blame it on Cover Girl & Breyer’s — A couple of years ago, I remember a UN Development Program Report complaining that Americans spent more on cosmetics and Europeans more on ice cream annually than it would cost to provide basic education, or water and sanitation to all the world’s poor people. This report said ""the world cannot arrive at an equitable distribution of goods"". It advocates a world that is less unbalanced and sets different priorities. Says the program’s administrator James Speth, ""Not everyone has been invited to the party."" However, the UN continues its policy of sanctions in Iraq that make clean water and sanitary conditions nonexistent. A slight dilemma here?

Everyone in Iraq, including the children, have been forced into attending this “party”.

Simple fact: If we had Accountants in Washington instead of Lawyers, we wouldn’t be proclaiming a budget surplus.

170284,"CNBC’s long-running “jobs Friday” fetish is getting downright appalling. Each month the BLS puts out a treasure trove of data on the rich and complex mosaic of the US labor market—-a download that embodies a truly frightening trend of economic failure.Yet the clowns who assemble in its screen boxes to opine on Hampton Pearson’s 30-second summary of the BLS release never have a clue. In their allotted 15 seconds of fame, they merely bloviate about the single dumbed-down number—-the establishment survey jobs print—that is the sum and substance of the coverage.Trained seals would be just as effective: ort! ort! ort!In any event, within seconds the SPX futures are off to the races, flashing the trading algos’ instant take on what the “print” means for one thing alone. Namely, does it portend continued or even more ease at the Fed and a plentitude of juice for Wall Street speculators.Last Friday CNBC inadvertently indicted it own pandering when the winner of its “pick the number” contest hit 142,000 jobs right on the head, making a mockery of the 200-250k consensus range that had issued from the “experts”. The winning viewer’s name was Ronnie Squires, who described himself as “retired” and the owner of a (very) small business through which he occasionally transports unwanted cats and dogs in his pick-up to new out-of-state “homes” for friends. Along the way, he does his own jobs survey:

“I do a lot of traveling around the country and there’s still a lot of folks who say ‘there’s no jobs out there’. I watch [CNBC] every day and I just don’t see it. I don’t know if the people on Wall Street are not really getting out and seeing what’s really going on [in America]. When you go to small towns, like I do, and talk to people – people don’t have much confidence in the numbers you hear.“

In a few deft seconds, a “no jobs” nobody who apparently doesn’t actually have one himself, essentially explained the contents of the chart below to his silenced CNBC hosts. Over the course of 170 “jobs Fridays” since mid-2000, the latter have apparently never noticed the single most stunning fact embedded in the monthly BLS report. Namely, that outside of health and education there has not been one net new job created in the American economy since July 2000! Yes, not a single new job—as in none, nein, nichts, nada, zip!

Yes, we do have about 7.3 million more teachers, nurses, home health aides and bed-pan changers—-meaning that the total job count in what I have termed the HES Complex (health, education and social services) now stands at 31.7 million compared to 24.4 million in early 2000 (see below). Moreover, since all work is noble—-that applies not the least to the labors of those who educate our children and care for the sick.

The point here, however, is about economics, not social worth. And in the realm of economics, the notion implicit in “jobs Friday”—-that all jobs are created equal—-is simply a fatuous shibboleth.

In fact, the 107 million non-HES Complex jobs shown above can be divided into two categories—–part time jobs and breadwinner jobs. Compared to breadwinner jobs which pay about $$50,000 per year, the former pay at a rate of about $$20,000 annualized, reflecting around 26 hours of work per week and hourly pay of about $$14.

Stated differently, the bartender, waiter, bellhop, maid, shoe repair, retail clerk and temp positions reflected in the graph below represent 40% jobs from an economic value perspective. And from a societal angle, they provide no foundation whatsoever on which to support middle-class families and a thriving citizenry.

By contrast, breadwinner jobs in manufacturing, mining, construction, FIRE, transportation and distribution, information technology, the white collar profession and business management do generate the means for at least a minimum standard of living. Unfortunately, the graph shows an awful truth that Steve Leisman and Mark Zandi, the Keynesian statist from Moody’s Economics (who advised John McCain in the 2008 campaign to fold his tent on the abominable Wall Street bailout), have never noticed.Namely, that the US economy has been losing breadwinner jobs at a rate of 18,000 per month for 14 years running.

Taken together, these two charts leave nothing to the imagination. Since Bill Clinton’s last month in office there has been a 3 million or 5% shrinkage of breadwinner jobs. There is nothing like this in modern history, yet the Jobs Friday revelers have always been oblivious to that economically debilitating trend—a harsh reality which massively dwarfs the seasonally maladjusted, continuously revised, heavily imputed and guesstimated monthly noise that is the essence of Hampton Pearson’s summary.

Even when you look at the growth in part-time jobs outside the HES-Complex, the pattern has been volatile and tepid on a trend basis. During the “recovery” since the Great Recession ended in June 2009, for example, most of the gain has consisted of “born again jobs”. That is, two-thirds of the 3.7 million part-time job gains reported since June 2009 were first generated during the Greenspan housing bubble. Needless to say, they were then wiped-out during the Great Recession plunge—- only to be slowly recouped in the 61 months since then as “born again” jobs represented as new hires.

Stated differently, Bernanke boasted in February 2004 that the US economy had entered a period he was pleased to term “The Great Moderation”. But it didn’t exactly work out that way—since just four years later he claimed the nation’s economy stood at the gates of the Great Depression 2.0.

Bernanke’s lack of clairvoyance, however, is not the point here. At least by the lights of the monetary central planners in the Eccles Building, the 14 year since the turn of the century were certainly intended to represent a great moderation. That’s why twice during that period they flooded the financial markets with unprecedented liquidity—–a maneuver designed to flatten the cyclical bottom and ignite the rebound.

Yet what did it do for the non-HES labor market? It did not arrest the trend decline in breadwinner jobs in the slightest. And even in that bleak corner of the economy that I have labeled the part time economy there has been a net gain of just 21,000 per month over the past 14 and one-half years.

That bears repetition. During a decade and one-half, the US economy has managed to generate only 21,000 part-time jobs per month outside the HES Complex. So it might well be well and truly wondered how these people keep putting on their party hats month-after-month.

In the first place, even if you believe that prosperity can be sustained by the vaunted “shop until they drop” American consumer, the pattern shown above doesn’t get the job done by a long shot. The periodic rebirth of a modest quotient of part-time positions paying $$20k per year will support robust consumption spending in the current GDP reports only at the expense of ballooning credit losses and over-time work for the repo man down the road.

Apart from this obvious non-starter, there are three specific facets of the American economy’s complete dependence on the HES Complex for job growth that are deeply troubling, but have perennially escaped the notice of the Jobs Friday commentariat.

First, nearly all of these jobs are “fiscally dependent” owing to direct government spending, loans and tax expenditures. At present, total government expenditures for Medicare and Medicaid, for example, amount to $$1.2 trillion annually and account for well-more than 50% of health service delivery, but upwards of 90% in some areas that are jobs intensive. The 3.3 million jobs in nursing facilities, for example, are almost completely funded by Medicare and Medicaid.

Likewise, the number of home health care jobs has soared by 700k and nearly doubled since the year 2000, but this sector is also heavily dependent upon the two big government programs. At the same time, the tax expenditure each year for employer-based health coverage and individual tax credits and deductions is upwards of $$200 billion, meaning absent these underlying fiscal subventions—- health care expenditures and employment gains would be far lower.

Even in the education sector where 13.6 million jobs were reported for August compared to 11.6 million in January 2000, 75% of this pick-up was in higher education, not K-12; and it goes without saying that the boom in higher education is the direct result of $$1.2 trillion in student loans and $$40 billion annually in direct grant programs financed entirely by Uncle Sam.

On the margin, all of this fabulous fiscal support for the HES Complex consists of borrowed money—-since if there actually were a balanced budget law that required today’s taxpayers to foot the cost of government rather than the unborn taxpayers of tomorrow, the first thing to be cut would be the giant subsidies being collected by the health and education cartels. In any event, governments are now bumping up against “peak debt”, meaning that the stupendous flow of fiscal resources to the HES Complex is beginning to abate sharply, resulting in a unmistakable slowing in the rate of so-called job creation.

During the Greenspan Boom between 2000 and 2007, for example, the monthly rate of job creation in the HES Complex was 51,000. During the Great Recession that slowed to 43,000 per month; and during the 61 months of recovery since then it has dropped further to just 28,000 per month. In short, the American jobs machine—-tentative as it has been for the past 14 years—-has essentially rested on a fiscal mirage that is now reaching it waning days.

The second disability follows—namely, that HES Complex job growth has nothing to do with monetary policy. There is no way, shape or form by which the Yellen Fed’s focus on the labor market, and its determination to keep the lunacy of zero interest in place for what will be 78 month running through mid-2015, actually stimulates activity rates and jobs in the HES Complex.

Overwhelmingly, the hospitals, doctors offices, outpatient clinics, nursing homes, for profit higher ed diploma mills and just plain old public education system do not borrow large amounts of money to operate. They do not care whether the money market interest rate is zero or 5%.

The credit market transmission mechanism for Fed policy is over and done, anyway, because the household sector has reached peak debt, as shown below. But the obvious point is that the HES Complex was never dependent upon cheap interest rates and booming debt creation in the first place. It was about fiscal transfers all along.

In short, the Fed has managed to grow it balance sheet from $$500 billion to $$4.4 trillion during the period encompassed by the charts above—-and the overwhelming Keynesian rationale has been saving and creating jobs. Yet the only net jobs created in the US economy during this period had absolutely nothing to do with this manic spree of money printing. Would that one of Janet Yellen’s vaunted “dashboards” carried a reminder to that effect.

Finally, there is the issue of productity and paying our bills as a nation. We import about $$2.5 trillion per year. That giant inflow of consumer products, capital goods and raw materials has to be paid for out of exports of goods and services— or the shortfall must be borrowed from the rest of the world.

The Keynesian money printers, of course, counsel not to worry, because foreigners are eager lenders to an American nation that has lived beyond its means for 30 years. According to Greenspan, Bernanke, and any random Wall Street economist you might happen to choose, the peasants of Asia who have come out of the rice paddies to earn a meager living in the slave factories of east China have an irrational penchant to over-save and thereby accommodate the $$12 trillion debt of the US household sector.

Needless to say, that’s a fairy tale. Sooner or later, the American economy will be forced to import only what its earns in foreign sales and services because the export of excess dollars and debt by the Federal Reserve will be brought to a halt as the global central bank race to the bottom enters its final phases.

In this context, there has self-evidently been no recovery in goods production. As of last Friday’s report, the number of jobs in construction, manufacturing and mining (including energy) had hardly budged from the recession bottom and was down nearly 25% from the level of January 2000.

So at the end of the day, the HES Complex does not help the US economy pay its way. Essentially, America has been creating jobs only by borrowing from the rest of the world—–more than $$10 trillion on a balance of trade basis during the last 30 years.

And most certainly, this is a structural barrier to real economic growth and job creation that the revelers on Jobs Friday have never even remotely bothered to note.

224258,"Recently by Gary North: Questions for Bernanke

Every once in a while, some famous defender of a position switches without warning to the rival position. A famous atheist becomes a believer in God (Antony Flew). A famous Protestant becomes a Catholic (Richard John Neuhaus). A famous Chicago School economist becomes a Keynesian (Richard Posner). These events are unexpected, especially by the people who make the switch. When it happens, the former disciples are left high and dry.

I am not talking about people who go to work for the enemy. Adam Smith, the most famous opponent of tariffs, became the commissioner of customs for Scotland within two years of the publication of The Wealth of Nations. Alan Greenspan, a defender of the gold standard in 1966, became Chairman of the Federal Reserve in 1987. I am talking rather about an unpredictable reversal of an opinion which had defined the person. Such a reversal usually costs the person. He is seen as having betrayed his followers, whose own opinions had been shaped by his. He may lose income if he had been selling his self-defining idea.

The amazing thing is when the followers accept the switch and instantly adopt their guru’s opinion without question. Populist FED-hater Ellen Brown’s switch to full support of Bernanke’s QE2 policies within three weeks of the FED’s announcement in November 2010 is a recent example. She insisted that this was not a switch at all. Her devoted followers went along with her.

Sometimes the person says that he was persuaded by new facts. Yet these supposedly new facts in almost all instances had been around for years. Why had the person not accepted these facts before? He does not offer persuasive reasons.

RICK ACKERMAN’S FLIP-FLOP

Rick Ackerman publicly predicted price deflation  serious, world-shattering price deflation  for 20 years. He believed it for 30 years. Overnight, he has switched.

For two decades, he has been saying I was wrong to predict price inflation. Typical was this: Killer Deflation Eludes Monetarist North. (I am not a monetarist, which was Milton Friedman’s position, which I have always opposed.) For two decades, he was wrong. Yet he did not switch. The relentlessly upward move in consumer prices did not persuade him, decade after decade.

On April 5, he once again threw down a challenge: Big Gap in Logic Weakens Hyperinflation Argument He has been doing this for 20 years. Nothing new here. So, I ignored it. I have responded in the past. Here is an example. It was a waste of my time. In any case, I do not predict hyperinflation, unless Congress intervenes and nationalizes the Federal Reserve System, which I do not think it will do. I do predict rising price inflation, but not the complete destruction of the dollar.

I agree with Charles Hugh Smith. Ackerman began with him.

Basically, he argues that it would not suit the interests of the rich and powerful, who after all are heavily invested in financial assets that would plummet in value. I have argued the same point, albeit from a different angle, by asking the inflationists to explain why the supposed Masters of the Universe would permit hyperinflation when it would effectively allow Joe Sixpack to pay off his mortgage and all other debts held by the rich and powerful with confetti. Smith’s paper is entitled The Mechanics of Hyperinflation: Bankers vs. Politicos, and it can be accessed by clicking here. He provides a further link to an Austrian analysis that explains why Weimar’s money blowout was quite different from anything that might occur in the U.S. The crux of it is that Germany’s money supply was controlled by the political class rather than by such rich and powerful behind-the-scenes players as created and still control the Federal Reserve. I would ask that anyone who joins in the discussion from this point forward be familiar with Smith’s argument, if not necessarily with the Austrian treatise.

Then he went on with an argument about real estate prices.

I predicted here years ago that home prices would eventually fall by at least 70 percent before deflation ran its course, and I am sticking with that forecast. It implies that even after the wholesale price destruction that has occurred over the last three years, the worst is yet to come.

And yet, for the moment, it is understandable that the hyperinflation argument has been enjoying (if you’ll pardon that word) a bold resurgence  one that has caused even me, a hard-core deflationist who has been writing on the topic since the mid-1990s, to second-guess myself. After all, fuel and grocery prices are rising steeply, and Federal debt  $$14.270 trillion and counting  has entered a vertical parabola.

He then presented a completely convoluted argument.

To repeat: Hyperinflation would require the shifting of cash money into physical goods and assets. But other than mattress money and the relatively paltry sums of cash on hand at branch banks, there would be precious little cash to shift. And if the panicked money is assumed to come out of Treasurys and other paper assets, it begs the question of how much the paper assets will fetch on the day when there are no buyers other than the Federal Reserve. . . .

I invite readers to attempt to rebut my argument in the Rick’s Picks forum  – to tell me exactly where the cash will come from that would allow Americans to bid the price of hard assets into the ionosphere. In the meantime, I plan to run a guest commentary later this week concerning one asset class that seems likely to outperform all others. Hint: it is not bullion. And, this investment category could conceivably increase in absolute value for the same reason that the pine forests of the Southwest are dying. Under the circumstances, the asset appears to be very undervalued at the moment. It will be out of reach once the system crashes.

I had never seen him more incoherent. As it has turned out, he was at the end of the road. It was a 30-year road. On April 25, he announced:

Hyperinflation vs. Deflation: I Concede

FOFOA blogspot has taken pains to lay out the most cogent, exquisitely nuanced and, ultimately, persuasive argument for hyperinflation that I have read to date. You can access it by clicking here. I’ve responded as follows but plan to write later, in agreement, at greater length.

Sheesh! Where to begin? It’s difficult to give up a belief system that took root 30 years ago, but I find your arguments irresistible. I took notes as I read the essay, thinking to rebut you point-by-point; instead, halfway through it I found myself overwhelmed by the clarity of your thoughts. The real power of this essay is that each step of the hyperinflationary endgame you foresee is entirely consistent with human nature, particularly where self-interest and self-preservation are fated to play out.

Incredible! Three decades of bad assumptions, yet all that it took to persuade his self-defining outlook him was an article on anonymous blog. All of a sudden, hyperinflation is “entirely consistent with human nature.”

Out of the deep freeze and into the fire.

But what of non-hyperinflationary Charles Hugh Smith, who three weeks earlier had been a model for him? Gone!

So, as always, I find that I do not agree with Ackerman. I agree with Smith. Smith wrote this in the article Ackerman recommended on April 5:

My problem with the “hyper-inflation is inevitable” school of thought is that I cannot identify what powerful interests would gain from the destruction of the currency and all financial wealth. A hyper-inflationary wipeout certainly wouldn’t benefit the Financial Power Elites who hold the vast majority of the financial wealth. Yet it is this very Elite which wields the preponderance of political power.

Thus you end up with this untenable conclusion: the politically powerful Financial Elite will consciously choose to self-destruct. I don’t buy that as a likely scenario. If inflation started destroying their wealth, then they would instantly influence political policy to reverse course to preserve their wealth.

I will not be spending time refuting Ackerman. That did me no good over the last 20 years. It will do me no good now.

I am the equivalent of a meat-lover. Ackerman was the equivalent of a vegetarian. He would not hear of meat-eating. Meat-eating made no sense. All of a sudden, he recommends cannibalism. I prefer steaks. I always did.

Here is the April 4 essay that prompted him to write his convoluted article on April 5.

Here is the article that converted him.

It argues that politics will overcome central banking. Hyperinflation will then hit in full force. I believe that such an outcome is possible politically. I think it will not happen. What I have always said is this: there is no deflationary factor in the structure of the capital markets to keep a central bank from destroying the currency unit. There are no deflationary forces that central banking cannot overcome if it chooses to destroy the currency unit.

EVER SINCE 1967

I argued with deflationist Martin Weiss back in a recorded debate in 1982 that price deflation would not come anytime soon. I had been arguing ever since 1967 that his father, J. Irving Weiss, had been wrong in predicting deflation in 1967. Finally in 2009, the son switched. He now predicts price inflation.

Will price deflation ever come? Every inflationist says it will. The question is timing: either before hyperinflation or after, when the economy adopts a replacement currency. What Ludwig von Mises called the crack-up boom (hyperinflation) inevitably cracks up. A new currency replaces the now-extinct one.

I don’t think we are near an era of central bank monetary stability, recession, and depression. Central bankers can still safely inflate, and they will.

With Ackerman gone, this leaves Mish and Robert Prechter as the last famous deflationists still standing. But there were never many of them. They were always vastly outnumbered by hard-money analysts who predicted price inflation. From John Exter and C. V. Myers in the mid-1970s until today, the leaders of the deflationist camp have been few and far between. Today, they are fewer and even farther between.

Charles

Munger is so deeply sceptical about the human condition, wrote

Roger Lowenstein in Buffett:

The Making of an American Capitalist (Weidenfeld & Nicholson,

1996), that Warren Buffett has called him ""the abominable no-man.""

A tenet of Munger's approach to investing — and to life in general

— is constantly to ask what can and likely will go awry. ""Invert,

always invert,"" said the mathematician Carl

Jacobi, and for decades Munger has faithfully applied this maxim.

Invited to address high school graduands, he did not laud the habits

and qualities that would promote health, wealth and wisdom; instead,

he denigrated those that would ensure emotional penury and material

misery. In effect, he counselled his young audience ""If you

don't do the things I'm going to talk about, then chances

are you'll be just fine."" More whimsically, he once wondered

aloud where he would die ""so that I never go there.""

Clearly, to

""invert, always invert"" is to mitigate the downside and

let the upside take care of itself. It is also to see things from

another person's point of view; and a particularly illuminating

way is to consider a contentious situation from the perspective

of an opponent or adversary. If we can avoid harming others, or

offer amends to those whom we inadvertently harm, then we lessen

their incentive to hurt us; and if we can make habits of civility

and neighbourliness, we will likely reduce some of the misfortune

that life routinely tosses into our paths. Umbrage and hatred seem

to flourish longest and deepest among people who have lost — or

never possessed — the capacity to empathise with those whom they

have harmed, and also among the people who have retained the capacity

to remember the harm they have suffered. How to avoid injuring others?

We become more inclined to treat other people as we would want them

to treat us, and thereby to increase the chances that we enjoy their

goodwill, when we try to see their situation, predicament or grievance

through their spectacles. A good way to avoid unintended consequences,

and to mitigate what might go awry and return to haunt us, is to

walk in others' shoes.

David Ben-Gurion,

Israel's first prime minister, seemed to be thinking along these

lines when he said ""If I were an Arab leader I would never

make terms with Israel. That is natural: we have taken their country

… We come from Israel, but two thousand years ago, and what is that

to them? There has been anti-Semitism, the Nazis, Hitler and Auschwitz,

but was that their fault? They only see one thing: we have come

here and stolen their country. Why should they accept that?""

(See also John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, The

Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy).

Alas, Ben-Gurion

did not seem to be ""inverting"" when he declared ""We

must use terror, assassination, intimidation, land confiscation

and the cutting of all social services to rid the Galilee of its

Arab population."" Even more regrettably, this apparent lack

of compassion for people other than his own also spread further

afield. In 1948, the year the State of Israel was founded, he declared

""We should prepare to go over to the offensive. Our aim is

to smash Lebanon, Trans-Jordan, and Syria. The weak point is Lebanon,

for the Moslem regime is artificial and easy for us to undermine.

We shall establish a Christian state there, and then we will smash

the Arab Legion, eliminate Trans-Jordan; Syria will fall to us.

We then bomb and move on and take Port Said, Alexandria and Sinai""

(see Michel Bar-Zohar, The

Armed Prophet: A Biography of Ben-Gurion, Barker, 1967).

from an unaccustomed, unconventional or unpopular angle often helps

to understand them more thoroughly, appreciate their worth and acknowledge

their flaws. It thereby promotes humility and inoculates against

narrow-mindedness and intransigence. ""Inversion"" does

not necessarily corrode one's principles; still less does it inevitably

overturn them. Yet once in a great while, it triggers a fundamental

alteration of outlook. But because it is so emotionally difficult

— indeed, because something akin to the Stockholm

Syndrome usually prevails — people go to extraordinary lengths

to avoid reappraisals of their rulers. Perhaps that is why so few

Australians, for example, think seriously about how their rulers'

policies affect people in other countries. After all, foreign lands

are usually distant and unfamiliar; there are only so many hours

in the day to inform oneself about them; and other matters, from

mortgage rates to petrol prices, seem to be more pressing. Accordingly,

are not such specialised matters best left to the anointed experts

in Canberra, the universities, think tanks and editorial pages?

And surely the motives of Australian politicians and their Anglo-American

masters are unimpeachable?

But shortages

of time do not provide very satisfactory explanations of this general

abandonment of the classical liberal virtue of vigilance. It is

clear to anybody who opens his eyes that the policies of the Western

political class routinely create messes and disasters at home: so

why on earth should they foment anything other than chaos and misery

abroad? Alas, few of the ruled ask this question. Instead, many

avert their eyes and blindly accept what their rulers tell them

about foreigners and far-off parts of the world. Why? Perhaps because

if they saw things from the point of view of people at the receiving

end of Western governments' foreign policies, an awful truth would

stare them in the face: during and since the Second World War, some

celebrated Western ""leaders,"" particularly American and

British, have, by the standards employed at Nuremberg, qualified

as war criminals.

As an example,

consider Harry S Truman. Ralph Raico, in ""Harry

S. Truman: Advancing the Revolution,"" concludes

""the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a war crime

worse than any that Japanese generals were executed for in Tokyo

and Manila. If Harry Truman was not a war criminal, then no one

ever was."" To say the least, America's most senior military

men, including Dwight Eisenhower, Ernest King, Douglas MacArthur,

Chester Nimitz and Carl Spaatz, expressed deep reservations about

the bombings — and to say the most, they condemned them as pitiless,

spiteful and unnecessary. The assessment of Admiral William D. Leahy,

Truman's chief of staff, was typical: ""the use of this barbarous

weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in

our war against Japan … My own feeling was that in being the first

to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians

of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make wars in that fashion,

and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children.""

In his memoirs,

entitled I Was There (McGraw-Hill, 1950), Leahy compared

the use of the atomic bomb to the treatment of civilians by Genghis

Khan, and termed it ""not worthy of Christian man."" Truman

himself eventually regretted his decision. In a private letter written

just before he left the White House, he referred to the dropping

of the bomb as ""murder,"" and concluded that it ""is

far worse than gas and biological warfare because it affects the

civilian population and murders them wholesale"" (see Barton

J. Bernstein, ""Origins of the U.S. Biological Warfare Program,""

in Preventing

a Biological Arms Race, MIT Press, 1990; John Denson, ""The

Hiroshima Myth""; Gary Kohls, ""Whitewashing

Hiroshima: The Uncritical Glorification of American Militarism"";

and Ralph Raico, ""Rethinking

Churchill,"" particularly Part

V).

What Is

a War Crime, Anyway?

A war crime

is a general label used to describe one of three specific crimes

enumerated and described in Article 6 of the Charter of the International

Military Tribunal (IMT). Immediately after the end of the Second

World War, the governments of the ""Big Four"" (i.e., the

U.S.A., Soviet Union, Britain and France) established the IMT in

order to prosecute the leaders of National Socialist Germany and

its allies. The Tribunal's Charter, published on 8 August 1945 (ironically,

shortly after the nuclear explosion at Hiroshima and just hours

before the second detonation at Nagasaki), declared in Article 6:

""The following acts, or any of them, are crimes coming within

the jurisdiction of the Tribunal for which there shall be individual

responsibility"":

""Crimes

against Peace: namely, planning, preparation, initiation or

waging of a war of aggression, or a war in violation of international

treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a Common

Plan or Conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing.""

In plain English, to invade a nation that has never threatened

you and does not presently threaten you is a crime against peace. ""War

Crimes: namely, violations of the laws or customs of war.

Such violations shall include, but not be limited to, murder,

ill-treatment or deportation to slave labour or for any other

purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory, murder

or ill-treatment of prisoners of war or persons on the seas, killing

of hostages, plunder of public or private property, wanton destruction

of cities, towns, or villages, or devastation not justified by

military necessity. ""Crimes

against Humanity: namely, murder, extermination, enslavement,

deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian

population, before or during the war, or persecutions on political,

racial, or religious grounds in execution of or in connection

with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether

or not in violation of domestic law of the country where perpetrated.""

Article 6 warns:

""Leaders, organisers, instigators, and accomplices participating

in the formulation or execution of a Common Plan or Conspiracy to

commit any of the foregoing crimes are responsible for all acts

performed by any persons in execution of such plan."" Section

7 states ""The official position of defendants, whether as Heads

of State or responsible officials in Government departments, shall

not be considered as freeing them from responsibility or mitigating

punishment."" And Section 8 cautions: ""The fact that the

defendant acted pursuant [to an order of a superior] shall not free

him from responsibility …""

At a series

of trials at Nuremberg, Germany, in 194549, these criteria were

used to try more than 100 defendants. At the most important trial,

of the top surviving leaders of Hitler's government and military,

twenty-two men were indicted on one or more of the charges listed

in Article 6. Nineteen were convicted and three acquitted. Of those

found guilty, twelve were sentenced to death by hanging, three to

life in prison and four to terms of imprisonment ranging from ten

to twenty years. No appeals were permitted, and the last surviving

convict, Rudolf Hess, died at Spandau Prison in Berlin in 1989.

In late 1946,

the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted Resolution

95 (1), affirming The

Principles of International Law Recognised in the Charter of the

Nuremberg Tribunal and in the Judgment of the Tribunal. In this

and other respects, the premises, process, results and precedents

of the Nuremberg Tribunal form cornerstones of civilised international

behaviour.

The Trouble

with Victors' Justice

The Nuremberg

Tribunal explicitly prohibited tu quoque (""you did it

too!"") defences — hardly a surprise, given that it rendered

victors' justice. The prosecuting powers sought to obscure the inconvenient

fact that during the war their civilian and military leaders, as

well as a few of their officers and enlisted men, had issued and

obeyed orders that fell well short of the standards imposed upon

Hitler's henchmen. This prohibition set a bad precedent. Surely

justice, if it is worthy of the name, cannot be restricted to particular

times, places and people? That is, if the invasion of Poland was

a crime against peace when Adolf Hitler and high-ranking German

officers and diplomats planned and executed it in 1939, then (to

cite but one example) surely the invasion of Iraq, when planned

and committed in 20012003 by George W. Bush, Tony Blair, John Howard

and their military and diplomatic subordinates, is no less a crime

against peace?

Apparently

not — or, at any rate, few Americans, Australians and Britons believe

that their leaders could contemplate, let alone commit, such crimes.

But if one peruses the public record and considers how Anglo-American

governments have planned and conducted military actions, then time

after time one encounters prima facie evidence that certain

of their politicians, bureaucrats, senior military officers and

a few soldiers and airmen have committed crimes against peace, war

crimes, and crimes against humanity as defined by the International

Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in 1945.

In light of

the voluminous evidence that now crowds the public domain, a case

can be made that in 20012003 American, British and Australian leaders

and their military and civilian advisers engaged in or acquiesced

to the ""planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war

of aggression."" It was obvious at the time (see in particular

Justin Raimondo, ""The

Lying Game,"" 7 February 2003), and today is as plain as

the nose on one's face, that neither Saddam Hussein nor the Iraqi

military posed any threat to America, Australia or Britain. The

many revelations by former insiders, coupled with the Downing

Street Memo, Lewis Libby indictment and numerous other sources,

leave little doubt that these insiders intentionally deceived their

own citizens and the world in order to invade a country that did

not threaten them.

Accordingly,

and by the precedent set at Nuremberg, the misleading and ever-changing

rationales uttered before, during and after the invasion exonerate

nobody. Nor does the evasive special pleading uttered after the

fact (""we acted on the best information available,"" Mr

Howard has bleated repeatedly since the WMDs failed to materialise).

To invade a country that has neither the means nor the intention

to attack you — whether or not the invaders know it when they

plan and execute their invasion — is a crime against peace.

As Murray Rothbard put it in The

Ethics of Liberty, ""It is important to insist, however,

that the threat of aggression be palpable, immediate, and direct;

in short, that it be embodied in the initiation of an overt act.

Any remote or indirect criterion — any u2018risk' or u2018threat' — is simply

an excuse for invasive action by the supposed u2018defender' against

the alleged u2018threat.'"" Whether waged by Nazis or neocons, a

""pre-emptive"" war is necessarily a crime against peace.

The ironic and rather pathetic fact that between 1991 and 2003 Saddam

Hussein was the only person who spoke truth to power about WMDs

in Iraq speaks volumes about the determination of Western politicians

and their lackeys to twist information in order to indulge their

inflexible prejudices.

Moreover,

and again in the light of the massive and growing body of evidence

available to anybody prepared to consider it, it appears that American

and British politicians and bureaucrats (and some military personnel

obeying their orders) have committed ""violations of the laws

or customs of war,"" including ""murder . . . of civilian

population of or in occupied territory, murder or ill-treatment

of prisoners of war . . . plunder of public or private property,

wanton destruction of cities, towns, or villages, or devastation

not justified by military necessity."" Acts that seem to fit

this description have occurred at Falluja,

Haditha,

Mahmoudiya,

Samarra,

Tikrit,

the Abu

Ghraib Prison and other locations.

These incidents,

it is reasonable to assume, are not isolated. Inevitably and by

its very nature, war, occupation, insurgency and counter-insurgency

breed atrocities (see, for example, ""Beyond

My Lai: New Revelations of Vietnam Atrocities"" by Jon Wiener).

Accordingly, when neoconservatives babble their despicable blather

(i.e., ""we must not cut and run,"" ""we must stay the

course,"" etc.), their use of the pronoun ""we"" is

disingenuous. What they really demand is that somebody else

must continue the destruction of faraway places and the murder of

anonymous people. Equally deceitful is their invocation of a bogus

and moronic ""war on terror"" and vast exaggeration of ""the

terrorist threat"" (which, as Leithner

Letter 33 shows, is in probabilistic terms actually quite trivial).

Hence an inconvenient question for the foreign policy interventionists:

if pleas of military necessity did not excuse leading Nazis, then

how can the alleged imperatives of a war on terror excuse the Three

Amigos and their subordinates?

The parallels

are troubling. In the dock at Nuremberg, did Hermann Göring

not plead that concentration camps were necessary in order to preserve

order and stability? Did he not say, ""It was a question of

removing danger""? Göring also shed disturbing light upon

the political tricks that demented shepherds use to frighten their

docile flocks into the false belief they need more regulations,

services and protection. During his trial, he mused to an interviewer

""Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some

poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best

that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece?

Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor

in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That

is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country

who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag

the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship

or a parliament or a communist dictatorship"" (see Gustave Gilbert,

Nuremberg

Diary, DaCapo Press, 1995).

A Grave

Responsibility Mocked and a Desperate Effort Repudiated

Today, more

than three years after the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq and overthrow

of Saddam Hussein, many Westerners have mostly forgotten (if, indeed,

they ever knew them) the transgressions of this war, its 1990–1991

predecessor and the many others that preceded them. They don't ""invert""

— that is, see things from others' points of view — because, by

and large, they have convinced themselves that their rulers are

right and just and others' are wrong and crazed. Hence it never

occurs to them that their politicians, in their name, commit war

crimes; and they respond with indifference, denial or even hostility

to the proposition that today's crop of Western politicians, like

their predecessors at Versailles, are creating conditions under

which extremists thrive.

Since 2003,

much mainstream coverage and commentary about the second war against

Iraq has focussed first upon the failure to send enough troops to

pacify the country; and then upon the decision to disband Saddam's

army without training a new one; and more recently upon the failure

to crush the insurgency and foresee the appalling communal violence;

and now upon the highhandedness, incompetence, cruelty and utter

pointlessness of the occupation. But little analysis has pondered

the legal questions arising from this and previous aggressions.

The UN's Secretary-General has put his view in an unusually blunt

fashion. In September 2004, Kofi Annan told the BBC: ""the US-led

invasion of Iraq was an illegal act that contravened the UN Charter.""

If so, then

the question arises: should Anglo-American politicians and their

top civilian and military aides be prosecuted for their repeated

violations over the years of the very laws devised in order to punish

Nazis after the Second World War? Do the precedents established

at Nuremberg apply to American and British officials? Or are they

somehow exempt from the principles that their predecessors invoked?

If not, why shouldn't Bush, Blair, Howard and their inner circle

be tried for the many deaths and untold misery their policies have

caused?

If, on the

same basis the Big Four employed to try Nazis at Nuremberg, the

leading members of the American, Australian and British governments

and armed forces were tried for actions taken in Iraq, Afghanistan

and elsewhere in recent years, they might well be convicted (see

Anwaar Hussein, ""Dust

Off the Nuremberg Files""; Michael Mandel, ""Nuremberg

Lesson for Iraq War: It's Murder""; and Michael Gaddy, ""The

Ghosts of Nuremberg""). In his Opening Address at Nuremberg,

Justice Robert Jackson of the U.S. Supreme Court began with these

words: ""The privilege of opening the first trial in history

for crimes against the peace of the world imposes a grave responsibility.""

Alas, during the intervening years, Western politicians have mocked

and debased this responsibility to such an extent that Nuremberg

principles are today little more than rhetorical devices uttered

on ceremonial occasions. So the Three Amigos need not worry. Apparently,

these principles apply only to captured thugs from Balkan or Third

World countries.

Yet reading

the Nuremberg transcript, it is clear that all who were accused

of crimes, from the humblest foot soldier to the highest and mightiest

civilian and military leader, were considered responsible for their

actions. In particular, the leaders and henchmen who initiated aggression

were assigned primary criminal responsibility. None of the subsequent

crimes would have been committed if the primary aggression — that

is, the crime against peace — had not occurred. On 12 August 1945,

Justice Jackson stated the objective of the American prosecution:

""If we can cultivate in the world the idea that aggressive

war-making is the way to the prisoner's dock rather than the way

to honours, we will have accomplished something toward making the

peace more secure. … We must make clear to the Germans that the

wrong for which their fallen leaders are on trial is not that they

lost the war, but that they started it.""

Justice Jackson's

subsequent statements concerning the Nazi leadership in the dock

go to the heart of the matter: ""These defendants were men of

a station and rank which does not soil its own hands with blood.

They were men who knew how to use lesser folk as tools. We want

to reach the planners and designers, the inciters and leaders without

whose evil architecture the world would not have been for so long

scourged with the violence and lawlessness, and wracked with the

agonies and convulsions, of this terrible war. … We have here the

surviving top politicians, militarists, financiers, diplomats, administrators

and propagandists of the Nazi movement. Who was responsible for

these crimes if they were not?""

On 1 October

1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal delivered its judgement. Three Amigos,

are you listening? ""To initiate a war of aggression is not

only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime

differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within

itself the accumulated evil of the whole … Crimes against international

law are committed by men, not by abstract entities; and only by

punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the provisions

of international law be enforced."" Had Bush, Blair and Howard

not unleashed their aggression, then tens of thousands of Iraqi

civilians, thousands of American and hundreds of British and other

military personnel would be alive today. Hence Justice Jackson's

last sentence of his closing statement applies to contemporary Anglo-American

leaders as much as it did to the Germans on trial at the time: ""If

you were to say of these men that they are not guilty, it would

be as true to say that there has been no war, there are no slain,

there has been no crime.""

Justice Jackson's

words thus prompt one to wonder: how would he assess the legal basis

of the Three Amigos' decision to wage their unprovoked war? Neoconservatives

would do well to remember his injunction: ""Our position is

that whatever grievances a nation may have, however objectionable

it finds the status quo, aggressive warfare is an illegal means

for settling these grievances or for altering these conditions.""

And those who cannot visualise American, Australian and British

defendants in a war crimes trial should also ponder Justice Jackson's

words: ""Let me make clear that while this law is first applied

against German aggressors, the law includes, and if it is to serve

a useful purpose it must condemn, aggression by any other nations,

including those which sit here now in judgment … This trial represents

mankind's desperate effort to apply the discipline of the law to

statesmen who have used their powers of state to attack the foundations

of the world's peace and to commit aggression against the rights

of their neighbours.""

Sixty years

later, it is clear that this desperate effort has failed. Ignore

their babble: the Three Amigos are above any law and accountable

to nobody. How on earth can this be? How can it be otherwise? The

""leaders"" of welfare-warfare states are nothing more than,

and have never been anything more than, the chiefs of criminal gangs

(see Murray Rothbard, The Ethics of Liberty, New York University

Press, 1998). They are not protectors: they are predators. Further,

major political parties (Liberal-National coalition versus Labor

in Australia, Labour v. Conservative in Britain, etc.) are not separate

entities offering distinct policies; instead, they are simply appendages

of a single welfare-warfare party. They are, to use Butler Schaffer's

apt analogy, wings of the same bird of prey. Those who have yet

to encounter — much less absorb — this self-evident truth cling

ferociously to the fairy tale of the benevolent state. Accordingly,

confronted with the evidence that some of their ""statesmen""

are better described as war criminals, they reply either with denial

or vitriol.

Contempt

of Criminality and Obedience to God

In the world

of business, finance and investments, Charles Munger constantly

asks what can and likely will go awry. Applied to rulers and their

policies of welfare and warfare, the rule is: whether at home or

abroad, interventionism creates unintended consequences; and these

consequences inevitably worsen the very problems that the interventions

allegedly sought to resolve. What, then, to do? A first step is

to disengage. In the absence of compelling reasons to the contrary,

regard anything uttered by any politician — and certainly any Anglo-American

politician — as an evasion, distortion, delusion or outright fabrication.

Don't believe them when they assert, in effect, that they can wave

a magic wand and give you something (be it ""security""

or ""quality healthcare"" or ""affordable childcare""

or low interest rates or cheap petrol) for nothing. And ignore their

vilifications of people in far-away places: if you have no reason

to meddle there, then what grounds have your rulers?

Why can't you

believe the wicked priests of the welfare-warfare caste? Jim Henley,

in his blog Unqualified Offerings (3 February 2003), answers

this question tartly:

Because

they lie. Routinely and often and deliberately. They said there

were 100,000 people in mass graves in Kosovo. That

was a lie. They said Iraqi soldiers were tossing babies

out of incubators. That

was a lie. They said Iraqi troops in 1991 were massing

on the Saudi border. That

was a lie. They said Saddam's attack on Kuwait was

a total surprise. That

was a lie. They said US troops had no combat role in

Central America in the 1980s. That

was a lie.

Right

through the Gulf War, I believed that sh**. By the time of Kosovo,

I knew better. I'm 42 years old, I knew the Middle East existed

before September 11, 2001, and if today's bunch sounds like a

lot of previous bunches that turned out to be full of crap, my

conclusion is that this bunch is full of crap too.

Today, neoconservative

politicians scream that Hezbollah, Syria and Iran are ""threats

to Western security."" These assertions, too, are bald-faced

lies (see, for example, Justin Raimondo, The

Lying Game Revisited). Another is that ""they hate us for

what we are."" The truth is that the victims of interventionism

hate Western politicians' relentless aggression, and the death and

destruction that it invariably generates. It is flatly wrong, in

other words, to insist that suicide attacks at Bali, London, Madrid,

New York and Washington, etc., have been conducted by ""Islamofascists""

engaged in a religious onslaught against the secular West (see in

particular Our

Fascism, and Theirs by Justin Raimondo). Instead, ""suicide-terrorist

attacks are not so much driven by religion as by a clear strategic

objective: to compel modern democracies to withdraw military forces

from the territory that the terrorists view as their homeland. From

Lebanon to Sri Lanka to Chechnya to Kashmir to the West Bank, every

major suicide terrorist campaign — over 95% of all incidents — has

had as its central objective to compel a democratic state to withdraw""

(see Robert Pape, Dying

to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism, Random

House, 2005). Suicide attacks, in short, are not a consequence of

religious extremism: they are a response to political extremism

— namely Western aggression and interventionism. Suicide attacks

occur over here because our politicians meddle so brutally over

there.

The good news,

in Pape's words, is that ""The history of the last 20 years

shows that once the [occupation forces] withdraw from the homeland

of the terrorists, [the suicide attacks] often stop — and stop on

a dime."" If so, then the bad news is that the more our politicians

intervene over there, the more the suicide bombers will retaliate

over here. The Three Amigos' alleged cure for terrorism is actually

a cause of terrorism. Memo to politicians: Do you truly want to

prevent suicide bombings? Then stop your aggression and invasions,

withdraw the troops and renounce interventionism (see also Patrick

Buchanan, ""Why

Are They Killing Us?"").

The truth

is that today's neoconservative lies are simply the latest in a

long series of statist lies. Anglo-American politicians have repeatedly

manipulated their subjects into war. These wars created unintended

consequences; and the next batch of politicians treated these consequences

with more interventions, more deceptions — and more war. Woodrow

Wilson, for example, lied America into the Great War (see Thomas

Fleming, The

Illusion of Victory: America in World War I, Basic Books,

2003); and Wilson's war, which he glorified as ""The War to

Make the World Safe for Democracy,"" became, in terms of its

effects, ""The War That Made the World Safe for Fascism.""

Similarly, Franklin Roosevelt bamboozled America into the Second

World War (see Thomas Fleming, The

New Dealers' War: FDR and the War Within World War II, Basic

Books, 2001). FDR's war, allegedly fought to defend and promote

The Four Freedoms,

became ""The War That Made the World Safe for Communism.""

And so too the Bushies: they have lied repeatedly and shamelessly

about Afghanistan and Iraq, and it appears that their aggressions

will become known as ""The Wars That Made the World Safe for

Christian, Jewish and Islamic Extremism.""

London's Lord

Mayor, ""Red"" Ken Livingston, one of the few politicians

who seems to know that there are no traffic problems, only insufficiently

clearly specified property rights, offered these

wise words when asked what motivated the attacks in New York,

Washington, London and elsewhere:

I think you've

just had 80 years of Western intervention into predominantly Arab

lands … We've propped up unsavoury governments, we've overthrown

ones we didn't consider sympathetic. And I think the particular

problem we have at the moment is that in the 1980s … the Americans

recruited and trained Osama Bin Laden, taught him how to kill,

to make bombs, and set him off to kill the Russians and drive

them out of Afghanistan. They didn't give any thought to the fact

that once he'd done that he might turn on his creators … If at

the end of the First World War we had done what we promised the

Arabs, which was to let them be free and have their own governments,

and kept out of Arab affairs, and just bought their oil, rather

than feeling we had to control the flow of oil, I suspect [attacks

by Muslim extremists in retaliation against the attacks of Western

extremists] wouldn't have arisen.

What to do?

Secondly, respect history. That is, understand the course of events

that has led to this sorry juncture, and extrapolate where the actions

that have created it, if they continue, will lead. For the past

century, America's foreign relations can best be characterised as

a series of subterfuges for empire-building (see in particular Ivan

Eland, The Empire Has No Clothes, The Independent Institute,

2004); and for the past half-century, the foreign relations of countries

like Australia, Britain and Canada have comprised little more than

the running of fools' errands for Uncle Sam. The trouble with meddling

in foreign lands, in addition to the misery, death and destruction

it wreaks upon its victims, is that it extinguishes liberty at home.

And the trouble with overt imperialism is epitomised in a question

that preoccupied Thucydides and Livy, absorbed America's Founders

and will likely overwhelm today's political caste in Washington:

when does empire corrupt and bankrupt a once-great republic beyond

the point of no return? (See also Laurence Kotlikoff's must-read

Is

the United States Bankrupt?).

The point for

foreigners is that Anglo-American politicians have no right to dictate

to the world and remake it in their image. The point for Americans

is that by dictating to the world they cease to be the Americans

in the sense that Thomas Jefferson understood that term — and Benjamin

Franklin rightly feared would disappear within a century. For Americans

and non-Americans alike, the extinction of Jeffersonian America

is a sad loss.

Interventionist

foreign policies, in short, breed war; and war spawns more interventionism.

War, as Randolph Bourne

famously put it, ""is the health of the state."" To advocate

war is to promote big government; and to promote big government

is to endorse failed programs. So make no mistake: war is just another

failed government program. Given this insight, what will the ""war

on terror"" achieve? Much killing, vast destruction of property

and liberty, and growing hatred: it will, in other words, benefit

the anointed and harm the benighted. Grieving the death of his only

son during the war to end all wars, in 1919 Rudyard Kipling wrote

""if any question why we died, tell them because our fathers

lied."" The same point applies to the Americans, Australians,

Britons, Canadians, Dutch and others mired pointlessly in Iraq and

Afghanistan.

Peace will

not come until Western and particularly Anglo-American politicians

abandon what they arrogantly believe is their birthright — the treatment

of the Arab and Muslim world like a pawn on a chessboard, drawing

its boundaries, making and breaking incompatible promises, occasionally

invading it and constantly meddling in its affairs, and establishing

and supporting puppets that oppress local populations. At various

points during the twentieth century, particularly at Versailles

and during the 1920s, Western politicians did little that mitigated

— and much that encouraged — the rise of extremism. Today, they

are doing exactly the same thing. A just peace can come only if

politicians stop creating a state of affairs in which extremists

thrive. Given their past and present form, a long time will pass

before they come to their senses. In the mean time, countries like

Australia, Britain and Canada should indeed adhere strictly to a

staunchly pro-American policy. But it must be ""pro-American""

in the proper historical sense of that term — one, alas, that is

alien to the best and brightest in Canberra, Ottawa and Westminster.

As Amir Butler expresses it in an outstanding article, Australia

Must Follow Washington — George Washington, that is.

What to do?

Thirdly and above all, Christians must abandon their moral relativism

(whereby it's OK when Christians kill Muslims over there, but it's

not OK if Muslims kill Christians over here) and worship of and

craven submission to the state. They must recognise the strict limits

of their duty towards the state (see in particular David Lipscomb's

""Civil

Government: Its Origin, Mission, and Destiny, and the Christian's

Relation to It,"" Michael Rozeff's ""Christians

and Libertarians,"" Teresa Whitehurst's ""Why

Are Some American Christians So Bloodthirsty?"" and Leithner

Letter 59). Lipscomb presents a biblical view of a voluntary

society. He refutes the fantasy that governments are created for

""the public good,"" and demonstrates that peace, progress

and civilisation do not and cannot depend upon the state. If Christians

participate in politics, they necessarily mock the Ten Commandments.

Instead, they should persuade people to renounce the use of force

— in all its forms, including taxation — embrace God and emulate

the Carpenter of Nazareth.

Christians

should pray that their earthly rulers rule justly. But they must

not glorify them, and still less should they bomb and kill for them.

What happens when Christians turn their backs to God and hail Caesar?

Consider the words from 1 Samuel (8:1118):

This is what

the king who will reign over you will do: He will take your sons

and make them serve with his chariots and horses, and they will

run in front of his chariots. Some he will assign to be commanders

This essay is chapter 15 of the book Egalitarianism As a Revolt Against Nature.

Murray Rothbard at his typewriter in the 1960s

Why be libertarian, anyway? By this we mean, what’s the point of the whole thing? Why engage in a deep and lifelong commitment to the principle and the goal of individual liberty? For such a commitment, in our largely unfree world, means inevitably a radical disagreement with, and alienation from, the status quo, an alienation which equally inevitably imposes many sacrifices in money and prestige. When life is short and the moment of victory far in the future, why go through all this?

Incredibly, we have found among the increasing number of libertarians in this country many people who come to a libertarian commitment from one or another extremely narrow and personal point of view. Many are irresistibly attracted to liberty as an intellectual system or as an aesthetic goal, but liberty remains for them a purely intellectual parlor game, totally divorced from what they consider the “real” activities of their daily lives. Others are motivated to remain libertarians solely from their anticipation of their own personal financial profit. Realizing that a free market would provide far greater opportunities for able, independent men to reap entrepreneurial profits, they become and remain libertarians solely to find larger opportunities for business profit. While it is true that opportunities for profit will be far greater and more widespread in a free market and a free society, placing one’s primary emphasis on this motivation for being a libertarian can only be considered grotesque. For in the often tortuous, difficult and grueling path that must be trod before liberty can be achieved, the libertarian’s opportunities for personal profit will far more often be negative than abundant.

The consequence of the narrow and myopic vision of both the gamester and the would-be profit maker is that neither group has the slightest interest in the work of building a libertarian movement. And yet it is only through building such a movement that liberty may ultimately be achieved. Ideas, and especially radical ideas, do not advance in the world in and by themselves, as it were in a vacuum; they can only be advanced by people and, therefore, the development and advancement of such people  and therefore of a “movement”  becomes a prime task for the libertarian who is really serious about advancing his goals.

Turning from these men of narrow vision, we must also see that utilitarianism  the common ground of free-market economists  is unsatisfactory for developing a flourishing libertarian movement. While it is true and valuable to know that a free market would bring far greater abundance and a healthier economy to everyone, rich and poor alike, a critical problem is whether this knowledge is enough to bring many people to a lifelong dedication to liberty.

In short, how many people will man the barricades and endure the many sacrifices that a consistent devotion to liberty entails, merely so that umpteen percent more people will have better bathtubs? Will they not rather set up for an easy life and forget the umpteen percent bathtubs? Ultimately, then, utilitarian economics, while indispensable in the developed structure of libertarian thought and action, is almost as unsatisfactory a basic groundwork for the movement as those opportunists who simply seek a short-range profit.

It is our view that for a flourishing libertarian movement, a lifelong dedication to liberty can only be grounded on a passion for justice. Here must be the mainspring of our drive, the armor that will sustain us in all the storms ahead, not the search for a quick buck, the playing of intellectual games or the cool calculation of general economic gains. And, to have a passion for justice, one must have a theory of what justice and injustice are  in short, a set of ethical principles of justice and injustice, which cannot be provided by utilitarian economics.

It is because we see the world reeking with injustices piled one on another to the very heavens that we are impelled to do all that we can to seek a world in which these and other injustices will be eradicated. Other traditional radical goals  such as the “abolition of poverty”  are, in contrast to this one, truly utopian, for man, simply by exerting his will, cannot abolish poverty. Poverty can only be abolished through the operation of certain economic factors  notably the investment of savings in capital  which can only operate by transforming nature over a long period of time. In short, man’s will is here severely limited by the workings of  to use an old-fashioned but still valid term  natural law. But injustices are deeds that are inflicted by one set of men on another; they are precisely the actions of men, and, hence, they and their elimination are subject to man’s instantaneous will.

Let us take an example: England’s centuries-long occupation and brutal oppression of the Irish people. Now if, in 1900, we had looked at the state of Ireland, and we had considered the poverty of the Irish people, we would have had to say: poverty could be improved by the English getting out and removing their land monopolies, but the ultimate elimination of poverty in Ireland, under the best of conditions, would take time and be subject to the workings of economic law. But the goal of ending English oppression  that could have been done by the instantaneous action of men’s will: by the English simply deciding to pull out of the country.

The fact that of course such decisions do not take place instantaneously is not the point; the point is that the very failure is an injustice that has been decided upon and imposed by the perpetrators of injustice  in this case, the English government. In the field of justice, man’s will is all; men can move mountains, if only men so decide. A passion for instantaneous justice  in short, a radical passion  is therefore not utopian, as would be a desire for the instant elimination of poverty or the instant transformation of everyone into a concert pianist. For instant justice could be achieved if enough people so willed.

A true passion for justice, then, must be radical  in short, it must at least wish to attain its goals radically and instantaneously. Leonard E. Read, founding president of the Foundation for Economic Education, expressed this radical spirit very aptly when he wrote a pamphlet I’d Push the Button. The problem was what to do about the network of price and wage controls then being imposed on the economy by the Office of Price Administration. Most economic liberals were timidly or “realistically” advocating one or another form of gradual or staggered decontrols; at that point, Mr. Read took an unequivocal and radical stand on principle: “if there were a button on this rostrum,” he began his address, “the pressing of which would release all wage and price controls instantaneously, I would put my finger on it and push!”[1]

The true test, then, of the radical spirit, is the button-pushing test: if we could push the button for instantaneous abolition of unjust invasions of liberty, would we do it? If we would not do it, we could scarcely call ourselves libertarians, and most of us would only do it if primarily guided by a passion for justice.

The genuine libertarian, then, is, in all senses of the word, an “abolitionist”; he would, if he could, abolish instantaneously all invasions of liberty, whether it be, in the original coining of the term, slavery, or whether it be the manifold other instances of State oppression. He would, in the words of another libertarian in a similar connection, “blister my thumb pushing that button!”

The libertarian must perforce be a “button pusher” and an “abolitionist.” Powered by justice, he cannot be moved by amoral utilitarian pleas that justice not come about until the criminals are “compensated.” Thus, when in the early 19th century, the great abolitionist movement arose, voices of moderation promptly appeared counseling that it would only be fair to abolish slavery if the slave masters were financially compensated for their loss. In short, after centuries of oppression and exploitation, the slave masters were supposed to be further rewarded by a handsome sum mulcted by force from the mass of innocent taxpayers! The most apt comment on this proposal was made by the English philosophical radical Benjamin Pearson, who remarked that “he had thought it was the slaves who should have been compensated”; clearly, such compensation could only justly have come from the slaveholders themselves.[2]

Antilibertarians, and antiradicals generally, characteristically make the point that such “abolitionism” is “unrealistic”; by making such a charge they are hopelessly confusing the desired goal with a strategic estimate of the probable outcome.

In framing principle, it is of the utmost importance not to mix in strategic estimates with the forging of desired goals. First, goals must be formulated, which, in this case, would be the instant abolition of slavery or whatever other statist oppression we are considering. And we must first frame these goals without considering the probability of attaining them. The libertarian goals are “realistic” in the sense that they could be achieved if enough people agreed on their desirability, and that, if achieved, they would bring about a far better world. The “realism” of the goal can only be challenged by a critique of the goal itself, not in the problem of how to attain it. Then, after we have decided on the goal, we face the entirely separate strategic question of how to attain that goal as rapidly as possible, how to build a movement to attain it, etc.

Thus, William Lloyd Garrison was not being “unrealistic” when, in the 1830s, he raised the glorious standard of immediate emancipation of the slaves. His goal was the proper one, and his strategic realism came in the fact that he did not expect his goal to be quickly reached. Or, as Garrison himself distinguished:

Urge immediate abolition as earnestly as we may, it will, alas! be gradual abolition in the end. We have never said that slavery would be overthrown by a single blow; that it ought to be, we shall always contend.[3]

Actually, in the realm of the strategic, raising the banner of pure and radical principle is generally the fastest way of arriving at radical goals. For if the pure goal is never brought to the fore, there will never be any momentum developed for driving toward it. Slavery would never have been abolished at all if the abolitionists had not raised the hue and cry thirty years earlier; and, as things came to pass, the abolition was at virtually a single blow rather than gradual or compensated.[4]

But above and beyond the requirements of strategy lie the commands of justice. In his famous editorial that launched The Liberator at the beginning of 1831, William Lloyd Garrison repented his previous adoption of the doctrine of gradual abolition:

I seize this opportunity to make a full and unequivocal recantation, and thus publicly to ask pardon of my God, of my country, and of my brethren, the poor slaves, for having uttered a sentiment so full of timidity, injustice and absurdity.

Upon being reproached for the habitual severity and heat of his language, Garrison retorted: “I have need to be all on fire, for I have mountains of ice about me to melt.” It is this spirit that must mark the man truly dedicated to the cause of liberty.[5]

216457,"I Have A Dream

I have a dream. My dream does not involve exalting a multicultural America or striving for racial harmony and universal equality.

Instead, I dream that one day I will be able to say “Drats!” to all the bloody PC hounds and speak my mind freely, without compromising to the various societal Thought Patrols invading my life. I dream that I will no longer have to check my opinions at some censorship door, making sure that somebody’s sensitivity meter won’t be set off. And I dream that there will be no PC reverberation forthcoming from my honest and truthful actions that others deem politically incorrect.

However politically incorrect others may judge me matters not. What is important is that I’m free to say what I mean.

I want to be free to say that the Ad Council commercial that was launched following the September 11th terrorist act is multicultural bilge. The commercial represents a stream of colorful, multi-ethnic faces — red, black, yellow, brown, Jewish, female, and then a white face or two — spouting the unwavering “I am an American”. This is the typical diversity utterance, and don’t I dare question it in my politically incorrect manner, according to the Though Patrols. I not only question it, but I also despise the message.

As a politically incorrect American, I note that every city, every town, and every county has a whole host of Martin Luther King Boulevards. One Boulevard in each city named after MLK appears to be necessary but not sufficient. It is PC to appease the 13% black population with endless affirmation of black history. The joke is: PASSENGER: “Turn left on MLK Boulevard.” DRIVER: “OK, but which MLK Boulevard?”

I like John Rocker, and how evil that must be. Not only was he a heck of a ballplayer before his verbal claim to fame, but he also gave us a great and truthful rundown of why one doesn’t want to ride the No. 7 train in New York. Then there’s the basketball genius Bobby Knight, a guy whom others detest. He doesn’t act like the politically correct culture expects him to act, so therefore, he’s a societal misfit and he’s deemed worthy of outcast status, according to the PC’ers. I especially look forward to the upcoming season and following Knight at Texas Tech.

I’m the kind of un-PC gal that would like to roll over Ed Begley, Jr. in one of his tiny electric-powered cars with my massive SUV. That’ll teach him to preach his socialist religion to the rest of us. I dream of being free to say that I favor trucks, SUVs, and other big cars over these roller-skate compacts the PC police would have us drive.

When Nancy Kerrigan got whacked in the leg by a Tanya Harding hitman, she emitted a strange series of sounds — Whyyyyyyyy? – that I mimic to this day, because it makes people laugh. It’s politically incorrect to laugh, however, if the laughing involves making fun of even a temporary misfortune of another.

I cheer for David Horowitz on the reparations issue, and I cannot believe that others could even make this topic a serious point of discussion. I once wrote my own very un-PC opinion on reparations, and the PC Peoples were appalled.

I am dumbfounded by the anti-gun PC’ers who consistently deny the right to bear arms and defend oneself. In fact, I’m so politically incorrect on the gun issue that I think I should be able to carry a fully automatic machine gun in my car, into my place of work, or elsewhere when the owner of private property may allow it. This will produce a wide range of “You lunatic!” hurlings from the Left. Nonetheless, it’s a basic belief for me. The PC anti-gunners never produce any logical arguments; only emotional rants based on fuzzy catchwords like children, societal harm, dangerous, and, did I say children?

I have never hunted but I am profoundly pro-hunting. I don’t smoke, but I dare the anti-smoking Nazis to tell me I can’t.

I think that daycare stinks and that pesticides are heroic. Daycare has a great potential for destroying children’s lives, while pesticides, DDT included, improve all of our lives. I make a point of watering my lawn on days when the mandatory watering bans are in effect; I do it as a statement against the wasteful public ownership of water and other utilities. Favoring privatization is as un-PC as it gets. Even my neighbors must not be very politically correct because, so far, no one has tattled on me for violating the watering ban every summer.

When the local governments declare “Ozone Action Days”, they mean to say that the very hot and humid weather is not conducive to any form of production or motorization. They ask us to refrain from cutting our grass or using any mechanized lawn equipment; they tell us to carpool; and, they say, don’t even fill your gas tanks because the gas fumes are not productive to the ozone layer. The sad thing is, people buy this propaganda. It’s a time to cut my lawn and fill my tank, as planned.

I detest the government-mandated, handicapped parking spots that flood the parking lots of my favorite shopping places. These spots are not designated by the owner of the property, but by government, based on some numbers-crunching formula on how many handicapped people might be parking there at any given time. I feel morally obligated to park in those spots. Besides, it’s not just for the handicapped or injured anymore. Handicapped now includes over-55 and healthy or 30-years-old and obese. One local supermarket now designates a few of the good spaces for pregnant women. This is a nice touch because it’s a decision made by the property owners based on an assessment of their customer base.

It’s not PC to say that decades of U.S. interventionist foreign policy has brought terrorism upon our citizens, and most recently, on our own soil. It’s not PC to oppose a full-scale war to prop up our military empire. It’s not PC to be anti-statist in a time when we are supposed to be waving our American flags, singing God Bless America, and “coming together” in the name of nationalist unity — all part of a propagandist’s dream. For that reason, anti-government dissenters are most un-PC right now.

Political correctness is a disease of the Left. It is a disease that imbues the mind with a sense of culpability toward those who need propping up by those enjoying some variety of physical or mental abundance. It is a disease that has invaded the mainstream’s catalog of rhetoric, replacing proper irreverence and nuances with inapplicable language deconstructions that suit the fragile types.

I refuse to submit to any mind-numbing attempt at linguistic fascism. I call fat people fat, stupid people stupid, and ugly people ugly. A pejorative is sometimes necessary to convey the facts. And when I speak of achievement, I don’t mention equality as being a substantial factor. I don’t even think about it. Plus, I stand opposed to the propaganda spewed by my government, and so I fail to heed the indoctrination. I stand opposed to the general masses in most opinions on otherwise PC subjects, and that’s good enough for me.

However, my dream is a long way from happening.

218740,"John Bolton, who’s as qualified as I am to be a United Nations ambassador, won’t make much difference, because the United Nations doesn’t amount to much. The so-called reforms the Bush administration wants are nothing but bureaucratic tinkering. Most of them have already been agreed to.

Some people on the right have used the United Nations as a booger-bear that threatens to become a world government. It is not a world government, and it never will be.

A government, world or otherwise, needs two powers. It needs the power to tax, and it needs the power to enforce its decisions — in other words, to wage war and to put people in prison. The United Nations lacks both. It was designed to be impotent.

The General Assembly, in which all the member nations and pseudo-nations get one vote each, has no power. It can pass resolutions up the gazoo, but it cannot enforce any of them. It is nothing but a forum for talk. For most of its ambassadors, it is an excuse to avoid living in their miserable countries.

The Security Council has the authority to levy economic sanctions and to wage war, but any one of the five permanent members — the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France — can veto any such resolution simply by voting no. Furthermore, assuming the five permanent members all agree, all the money and all the troops have to be volunteered by the member states. The U.N. has no army and no money, and no power to raise either.

While they might give some other nations a permanent seat on the Security Council for public-relations reasons, none of the present five members is about to grant any other nation veto power. Thus, any changes that are made will be essentially cosmetic.

And Americans should be happy about that. No sensible American wants a world government, because that would mean surrendering our sovereignty and independence to foreign rule. There have always been a few very liberal cranks yakking about world government, but it has never had any serious support in the United States. Any attempt to surrender America’s independence would be a cause for the people to take up arms. The probability of a world government is so low, it is essentially a red herring. It’s not even worth talking about.

All that said, the U.N. still has some useful functions. Its organizations that deal with health, children and refugees do good work. It is important to have a common forum where nations can discuss problems and hopefully build a consensus to solve them peacefully. Never worry, though, that the U.N. will be able to stop the United States from doing whatever it wants to do — or Russia, China, France or Great Britain, for that matter.

The reality is that the United States has and will use the United Nations to accomplish its own purposes or, in other cases, simply ignore it. Whenever we decide to ignore it, there is nothing the U.N. can do about it except talk.

The problem with Mr. Bolton is that he is a hack politician who has never shown any ability to build a consensus. The idea that ""tough guy"" Bolton will ""knock heads"" at the U.N. is silly. The ambassadors from Russia, China and France are tougher than he is, and a whole lot smarter. Bolton will be ineffective — which might, after all, be exactly what President Bush wants him to be. One Washington rumor says that Secretary of State Condi Rice wanted Bolton in the U.N. job because it gets him out of the policy-making business. In other words, it’s a face-saving way to dump him out of the loop.

The U.N. is just one more failed attempt to build a Tower of Babel. If you remember your Bible stories, a united population decided to build a tower that would reach heaven. God didn’t like the idea, so he caused all the workers to start speaking different languages. With the workers unable to communicate, the project collapsed.

The human race will never unite. We were created as tribes, and we will go extinct as tribes. Another tower, the European Union, is also starting to collapse. As I said, world government is the least of our worries.

For Sherlock Holmes fans, there is not only a large book titled “The Complete Sherlock Holmes” but also a boxed set of DVDs of many of the best Sherlock Holmes stories, starring Jeremy Brett as the best of a number of actors who have played the Holmes role over the years.

Among books on serious issues, some are great for people who are interested in a particular subject but have never read a good introduction to the issues involved. For young people, they may need to read something to counter the politically correct nonsense they have heard in their schools and colleges.

The recently published book “American Contempt for Liberty” by Walter E. Williams is an especially wide-ranging examination of current issues. This 417-page compilation of Professor Williams’ newspaper columns devastates innumerable politically correct beliefs, often providing not only new information but also some much-needed examples of rational thinking in general.

An older book that has been recommended here before, but will be recommended again because there is nothing else like it, is “Life at the Bottom,” by Theodore Dalrymple.

This is an insightful account of the dire consequences that the welfare state has led to among low-income whites in England.

Many will recognize striking similarities to problems among low-income blacks in America — problems often blamed on “a legacy of slavery,” but which have followed in the wake of the welfare state in England, among whites with no legacy of slavery.

Among my own books, “Basic Economics” remains the one read by the most people and translated into the most foreign languages. It presents economics without the graphs and equations, or the jargon, that make economics seem needlessly difficult to many people. “Basic Economics” was written with the idea that economics can be both informative and enjoyable.

My most recent book, published this past September, is “Wealth, Poverty and Politics.” It has received the kind of praise from reviewers that an author wants but seldom gets. Part of this may be due to the interest aroused by the subject matter itself and part to the book’s clarification of things that are too often presented in confused and misleading terms.

Much media hype about “the top ten percent” or “top one percent” of income earners collapses like a house of cards when you scrutinize the numbers and the words used to describe those numbers.

Over the course of a lifetime, for example, more than 60 percent of Americans are in households within the top ten percent of household incomes at one point or other. Politicians who want us to resent “the top ten percent” are encouraging most of us to resent ourselves.

Although that would not make sense, politicians are far less interested in making sense than in getting votes. Talk about the top ten percent or top one percent gets votes. And that is the politician’s bottom line.

For someone who likes to read about serious subjects but already has the kinds of books you might want to give as a gift, what no one has are future issues of outstanding publications on serious issues. A subscription to “City Journal” or “Hoover Digest” is a gift that would solve that problem.

171045,"Facebook has recently developed a new artificial intelligence (AI), and it has since created its own language using code words to communicate more efficiently. Researchers promptly shut the system down over concerns that they might lose control over the A.I.

This isn’t the first time AIs have diverged from their training in the English language to develop their own, more efficient language. While the resulting phrases from this condensed method of communication sound like gibberish to the human ear, they do in fact make semantic sense when interpreted by AI agents.

Negotiating in a New Language

As Fast Co. Design reports, the researchers noticed that the bots had completely given up on English, but their advanced system is actually capable of negotiating with other AI agents. Together, they can decide how to proceed with whatever they’re working on. At first, the phrases being used seemed unintelligible, but upon further observation, researchers found they represented the tasks at hand.

In one particular exchange, two of the negotiating robots, Bob and Alice, used their own language to complete their exchange. Bob started by saying, “I can I I everything else,” to which Alice responded, “Balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to.” The rest of the conversation was formed from multiple variations of these sentences.

Time to buy old US gold coins

While the phrases appear to be nonsensical upon first glance, researchers believe they reveal how the two robots are working out how many of each item they should take. Bob’s repetition indicates how it was using the language to offer more items to Alice. Interpreted in this way, his response becomes something like the way we might say, “I’ll have three and you have everything else.”

It seems the AI discovered that English phrases weren’t required for the specific scenario. Modern AIs operate on a “reward” principle, where they expect that by following a course of action they will receive a “benefit.” But in this scenario, for example, there was no reward for continuing to use English, so they decided to use a more efficient way of communicating instead.

According to FastCo. Designs, “Agents will drift off understandable language and invent code words for themselves. Like if I say ‘the’ five times, you interpret that to mean I want five copies of this item. This isn’t so different from the way communities of humans create shorthands.”

Other AI developers have noticed a similar use of “shorthands” to simplify communication. At a company called OpenAI — the AI lab founded by Tesla creator Elon Musk — an experiment succeeded in letting the AI robots learn their very own languages.

What’s the Problem?

If AI continues to create their own languages, developers may have problems creating and adopting new neural networks, but it’s unclear whether this would allow machines to actually overrule their operators.

These new developments, however, allow AI to work more efficiently and can benefit research teams in the long run if they put in the work to learn the new AI-created shorthand and stay up to date with this new method of communication.

After hauling out many dictionaries, Yoo managed to redefine torture in the following pretzled fashion: “must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.” Thus, did a junior member of the Bush administration open the legal way for waterboarding in the White House. This is the man who, only two weeks after September 11, wrote a memo to Gonzales’ deputy entitled The President’s Constitutional Authority to Conduct Military Operations against Terrorists and Nations Supporting Them, which is certainly in the running for the most sweeping claim of unfettered executive power in our nation’s history and which laid the (il)legal groundwork for an Iraq war of choice to come. “In the exercise of his plenary power to use military force,” Yoo insisted, “the President’s decisions are for him alone and are unreviewable.”

Over four years later, lobbying for torture is no longer restricted to secret, high-level White House meetings, insider memos from Justice Department lawyers, or little privately scrawled notes from Donald Rumsfeld — like the one on a November 27, 2002 memo on acceptable interrogation methods: “I stand for 8—10 hours a day. Why is standing [as a counter-resistance technique] limited to 4 hours?” Last week, on the torture side of the ledger, Vice President Cheney descended from the imperial heavens to lobby Senator McCain, a man who knows something about torture first-hand, to exempt the CIA (and possibly other secret agencies) from his amendment. According to the New York Times, here is the (tortured) wording of the exemption the Vice President was pushing:

“[The measure] shall not apply with respect to clandestine counterterrorism operations conducted abroad, with respect to terrorists who are not citizens of the United States, that are carried out by an element of the United States government other than the Department of Defense and are consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States and treaties to which the United States is a party, if the president determines that such operations are vital to the protection of the United States or its citizens from terrorist attack.”

“As for Mr. Cheney,” the Washington Post editorial page commented astringently, “[h]e will be remembered as the vice president who campaigned for torture.”

Last week, by the way, the ACLU released “an analysis of new and previously released autopsy and death reports of detainees held in U.S. facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan, many of whom died while being interrogated. The documents show that detainees were hooded, gagged, strangled, beaten with blunt objects, subjected to sleep deprivation and to hot and cold environmental conditions… The documents show that detainees died during or after interrogations by Navy Seals, Military Intelligence and u2018OGA’ (Other Governmental Agency) — a term, according to the ACLU, that is commonly used to refer to the CIA.” Evidently, this is just everyday life in the world created by Dick Cheney and John Yoo.

As it happened, Cheney was going for the torture trifecta. The Monday after the indictment and resignation of I. Lewis Libby, he announced the appointment of a new vice-presidential chief of staff, his counsel David Addington, a man the Washington Post has identified as “a principal author of the White House memo justifying torture of terrorism suspects. He was a prime advocate of arguments supporting the holding of terrorism suspects without access to courts.” These days, it seems, this is nothing short of a qualification for holding high office. After all, the three men who head our new Homeland Security State — Alberto Gonzales, Michael Chertoff, and Donald Rumsfeld (Justice, Homeland Security, and Defense) — were all intimately involved in creating and/or parsing pretzled definitions of torture meant to free our “commander-in-chief” to order more or less anything he wanted done to anyone at all out there in the imperium.

Now, the Vice President proudly joins this line-up with the lovely complaint (according to a number of publications) that McCain’s amendment “would bind the president’s hands in wartime.” (Ouch! And how that would hurt!)

Despite his anodyne prose, John Yoo is a living link between an imperial presidency freed of all constraints — or all that matter anyway — and the plunge into barbarism that has made torture the binding issue of this administration. (It’s the sort of connection that Caligula or Claudius would have grasped instantly.) David Cole, whose Enemy Aliens: Double Standards and Constitutional Freedoms in the War on Terrorism takes up the denial of basic constitutional rights in the name of “wartime” expediency, considers Yoo’s new book and the extreme theory of presidential power it proposes in an essay that is running in the November 17 issue of the New York Review of Books and appears here thanks to the kindness of that magazine’s editors. ~ Tom

What Bush Wants to Hear

A Consideration of John Yoo’s The Powers of War and Peace: The Constitution and Foreign Affairs After 9/11

By David Cole

Few lawyers have had more influence on President Bush’s legal policies in the “war on terror” than John Yoo. This is a remarkable feat, because Yoo was not a cabinet official, not a White House lawyer, and not even a senior officer within the Justice Department. He was merely a mid-level attorney in the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel with little supervisory authority and no power to enforce laws. Yet by all accounts, Yoo had a hand in virtually every major legal decision involving the U.S. response to the attacks of September 11, and at every point, so far as we know, his advice was virtually always the same — the president can do whatever the president wants.

Yoo’s most famous piece of advice was in an August 2002 memorandum stating that the president cannot constitutionally be barred from ordering torture in wartime — even though the United States has signed and ratified a treaty absolutely forbidding torture under all circumstances, and even though Congress has passed a law pursuant to that treaty, which without any exceptions prohibits torture. Yoo reasoned that because the Constitution makes the president the “Commander-in-Chief,” no law can restrict the actions he may take in pursuit of war. On this reasoning, the president would be entitled by the Constitution to resort to genocide if he wished.

Yoo is now back in private life, having returned to the law faculty at the University of California at Berkeley. Unlike some other former members of the administration, he seems to have few if any second thoughts about what he did, and has continued to aggressively defend his views. His book The Powers of War and Peace: The Constitution and Foreign Affairs After 9/11 shows why Yoo was so influential in the Bush administration. It presents exactly the arguments that the president would have wanted to hear. Yoo contends that the president has unilateral authority to initiate wars without congressional approval, and to interpret, terminate, and violate international treaties at will. Indeed, ratified treaties, Yoo believes, cannot be enforced by courts unless Congress enacts additional legislation to implement them. According to this view, Congress’s foreign affairs authority is largely limited to enacting domestic legislation and appropriating money. In other words, when it comes to foreign affairs, the president exercises unilateral authority largely unchecked by law — constitutional or international.

Yoo is by no means the first to advance such positions. Many conservatives favor a strong executive, especially when it comes to foreign affairs, and they are generally skeptical about international law. What Yoo offers that is new is an attempt to reconcile these modern-day conservative preferences with an influential conservative theory of constitutional interpretation: the “originalist” approach, which claims that the Constitution must be interpreted according to the specific understandings held by the framers, the ratifiers, and the public when the Constitution and its amendments were drafted.

The problem for originalists who believe in a strong executive and are cynical about international law is that the framers held precisely the opposite views — they were intensely wary of executive power, and as leaders of a new and vulnerable nation, they were eager to ensure that the mutual obligations they had negotiated with other countries would be honored and enforced. During the last two centuries, of course, executive power has greatly expanded in practice; and the attitude of many U.S. leaders toward international law has grown increasingly disrespectful as the relative strength of the U.S. compared to other nations has increased. But these developments are difficult to square with the doctrine of “original intent,” which, at least as expressed by Justice Antonin Scalia and other extreme conservatives, largely disregards the development of the law for the past two centuries. Yoo’s task is to reconcile the contemporary uses of American power with his belief in original intent. His views prevailed under the Bush administration, and therefore should be examined not only for their cogency and historical accuracy, but for their consequences for U.S. policy in the “war on terror.”

War

On its face, the Constitution divides power over foreign affairs. It gives Congress substantial responsibility, especially with respect to war. Congress has the power to raise and regulate the military; to declare war and issue “Letters of Marque and Reprisal,” which authorize lesser forms of conflict; to define offenses against the law of nations; and to regulate international commerce. The Senate must confirm all treaties and all appointments of ambassadors. The president is named as the “Commander-in-Chief,” and appoints ambassadors and makes treaties subject to the Senate’s consent. In addition, the words “executive power” have, since the beginning of the republic, been regarded as giving the president an implicit authority to represent the nation in foreign affairs.

These divisions of responsibility were conceived for widely recognized historical and philosophical reasons. The Constitution was drafted following the Revolutionary War, in which the colonies rebelled against the abuses of the British monarchy, the prototypical example of an unaccountable executive. The new nation so distrusted executive power that the first attempt to form a federal government, the Articles of Confederation, created only a multi-member Continental Congress, which was in turn dependent on the states for virtually all significant functions, including imposing taxes, regulating citizens’ behavior, raising an army, and going to war. That experiment failed, so the Constitution’s drafters gave Congress more power, and revived the concept of a branch of government headed by a single executive. But they insisted on substantial limits on the power of the new executive branch, and accordingly assigned to Congress strong powers that had traditionally been viewed as belonging to the executive — including the power to declare war.

Many of the framers passionately defended the decision to deny the president the power to involve the nation in war. When Pierce Butler, a member of the Constitutional Convention, proposed giving the president the power to make war, his proposal was roundly rejected. George Mason said the president was “not to be trusted” with the power of war, and that it should be left with Congress as a way of “clogging rather than facilitating war.” James Wilson, another member, argued that giving Congress the authority to declare war “will not hurry us into war; it is calculated to guard against it. It will not be in the power of a single man, or a single body of men, to involve us in such distress; for the important power of declaring war is vested in the legislature at large.” Even Alexander Hamilton, one of the founders most in favor of strong executive power, said that “the Legislature alone can interrupt [the blessings of peace] by placing the nation in a state of war.” As John Hart Ely, former dean of Stanford Law School, has commented, while the original intention of the Founders on many matters is often “obscure to the point of inscrutability,” when it comes to war powers “it isn’t.”

In the face of this evidence, Yoo boldly asserts that a deeper historical inquiry reveals a very different original intention — namely, to endow the president with power over foreign affairs virtually identical to that of the king of England, including the power to initiate wars without congressional authorization. He argues that the power to “declare War” given to Congress was not meant to include the power to begin or authorize a war, but simply the power to state officially that a war was on — a statement that would be “a courtesy to the enemy” and would authorize the executive to exercise various domestic wartime powers. At most, Yoo contends, the clause giving Congress power to “declare War” was meant to require congressional approval for “total war,” a term Yoo never defines, but it left to the president the unilateral decision to engage in all lesser hostilities. He quotes dictionaries from the founding period that defined “declare” as “to pronounce” or “to proclaim,” not “to commence.” He points out that the Constitution did not give Congress the power to “engage in” or to “levy” war, terms used in other constitutional provisions referring to war. And he notes that unlike some state constitutions of the time, the federal constitution did not require the president to consult Congress before going to war.

All the evidence Yoo cites, however, can be read more convincingly to corroborate the view he seeks to challenge — namely, that the Constitution gave the president only the power, as commander in chief, to carry out defensive wars when the country came under attack, and to direct operations in wars that Congress authorized. British precedent is of limited utility here, since the framers consciously departed from so much of it. Dictionary definitions of “declare” also offer little guidance, since Yoo ignores that there is a world of difference between someone’s “declaring” his or her love for wine or Mozart and a sovereign’s declaring war. “Declare War” was in fact a legal term of art, and there is evidence that it was used at the time to mean both the commencement of hostilities and a statement officially recognizing that war was ongoing. The use of the word “declare” rather than “levy” or “engage in” simply reflects the division of authority under which the president actually levies — or carries on — the war once it is begun. Indeed, the framers famously substituted “declare” for “make” in enumerating Congress’s war powers for just this reason. And the framers had no reason to require the president to consult with Congress before going to war since it was Congress’s decision, not the president’s.

Most troubling for Yoo’s thesis, his account renders the power to “declare War” a meaningless formality. At the time of the Constitution’s drafting, a formal “declaration of war” was not necessary for the exercise of war powers under either domestic or international law, so Yoo’s hypothesis that the declaration served that purpose fails. Yoo’s further suggestion that the clause recognizes a distinction between “total wars,” which must be declared, and lesser wars, which need not be, has no historical basis. Despite his ostensible commitment to originalism, Yoo cites no evidence whatever to suggest that any such distinction existed for the founding generation. Nor does he ever explain what the distinction might mean today. And the fact that the text grants Congress both the power to “declare War” and to issue “Letters of Marque and Reprisal” strongly suggests an intent that Congress decide on all forms of military conflict other than repelling attacks. Once these explanations evaporate, all that is left for Yoo’s theory of the war clause is that it gives Congress the power to provide a “courtesy to the enemy” — hardly a persuasive refutation of the clear language of the framers quoted above.

Yoo’s evidence does not undermine the conclusion that the framers intended Congress to take responsibility for the decision to send the nation into war. But in some sense, arguments against his theory are academic. Modern practice is closer to Yoo’s view than to the framers’ vision. Beginning with the Korean War, presidents have routinely involved the nation in military conflicts without waiting for Congress to authorize their initiatives. Yoo notes that while the nation has been involved in approximately 125 military conflicts, Congress has declared war only five times. Were the framers lacking in practical judgment when they gave Congress this power?

Yoo claims that since September 11, it is all the more essential that the nation be able to act swiftly and without hesitation, even preemptively, to protect itself. We can’t afford to wait around for Congress to figure out what it wants to do. The “war on terror” does not permit democratic deliberation, at least not in advance. And, as Yoo repeatedly insists, Congress remains free to cut off funds for any military action that it does not like.

But there is as good reason today as there was when the Constitution was drafted to give Congress the power to authorize military activities. As the framers accurately predicted, presidents have proven much more eager than Congress to involve the nation in wars. It is easier for one person to make up his mind than for a majority of two houses of Congress to agree on a war policy.

Presidents also tend to benefit from war more than members of Congress, by increasing their short-term popularity, by acquiring broader powers over both the civilian economy and the armed forces, and, sometimes, by the historical recognition later accorded them. Moreover, as the Vietnam War illustrated, even when a war becomes extremely unpopular, it is not easy to cut off funds for the troops.

It is true, as Yoo observes, that, since Harry Truman, presidents of both parties have generally resisted the view that they need congressional authorization to commit forces to military conflict. But this attitude is in fact a relatively recent development. While formal declarations of war have been rare, Yoo fails to note that presidents have generally sought congressional authorization for military actions. Until the Korean War, presidents either openly acknowledged that congressional authorization was necessary or offered rationales for why a particular military initiative was an exception to that rule. Thus, the view that Yoo promotes as “original” has in fact been advanced only during the last fifty years, and only by self-interested executives.

This view is particularly disputed by Congress, as can be seen in the 1973 War Powers Resolution, which sought to reaffirm and restore Congress’s constitutional role in deciding on whether to go to war, and also in the legislative debates that inevitably take place when presidents talk of going to war. As the war in Iraq has painfully underscored, the decision to go to war, especially a war initiated by the president without broad international support, can have disastrous consequences; and extricating the country from such a war can be extremely difficult. Were Congress to be eliminated from the initial decision-making process, as Yoo would prefer, the result would almost certainly be even more wars, and more quagmires such as the one in Iraq. On this issue, the framers were persuasive, and it is Yoo who has failed to understand both the checks on executive power they imposed and the reasons they did so.

Treaties

Yoo’s interpretation of the treaty power, like his view of the war power, departs dramatically from the text of the Constitution and its traditional understanding. The Constitution’s Supremacy Clause explicitly provides that

“all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby.

On the strength of that clause, and statements made about treaties at the time of the framing, it has long been accepted that treaties have the force of law in the United States, create binding obligations, and may be enforced by courts. Indeed, the Supreme Court long ago stated that treaties are “to be regarded…as equivalent to an act of the legislature.”

In the modern era, Congress often specifies when ratifying a treaty that it should not be enforceable in court until further legislation is enacted. And even without such directives, courts sometimes find treaties not to be judicially enforceable; the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit did so recently in rejecting a Guantnamo detainee’s claim that his pending trial in a military tribunal violated the Geneva Conventions.

Yoo would go further, insisting on a presumption against judicial enforcement unless Congress clearly specifies otherwise. On this view, treaties lack the force of law, and become mere political promises, having about as much force as campaign rhetoric. And he further claims that the president has unilateral authority to interpret, reinterpret, and terminate treaties, effectively rendering presidents above the law when it comes to treaties.

To support these revisionist views, Yoo relies heavily and repeatedly on a rigid dichotomy between foreign affairs — which he sees, in the British tradition, as the executive’s domain — and domestic matters — which he sees as the province of the legislature. But as we have seen, the Constitution’s framers explicitly rejected such a rigid division, giving Congress and the Senate substantial power over functions that the British saw as executive in nature, including the power to make war and treaties, and expressly assigning the judiciary the responsibility to enforce treaties as the “Law of the Land.”

If anything, Yoo’s historical evidence is even thinner with respect to the treaty power and the Supremacy Clause than it is with respect to the clause on declaring war. As Jack Rakove, one of the foremost historians of the federal period, has concluded, the framers “were virtually of one mind when it came to giving treaties the status of law.” As other historians have pointed out, one of the principal incentives for convening the Constitutional Convention was the embarrassing refusal of state governments to enforce treaties. The Supremacy Clause solved that problem in as direct a way as possible — by making treaties the “Law of the Land,” enforceable in courts and binding on government and citizenry alike. That treaties were not thought to need further implementing is underscored by the framers’ unanimous decision to omit treaty enforcement from Congress’s enumerated powers, “as being superfluous since treaties were to be u2018laws.'” Yoo’s account turns that conclusion on its head; his reading would render superfluous the Supremacy Clause’s assertion that treaties are laws. If treaties had domestic force only when implemented by a subsequent statute, as Yoo maintains, then the statute itself would have the status of the “Law of the Land,” not the treaty.

Yoo is no more convincing with respect to presidential interpretation of treaties. He maintains that because foreign policy is an executive prerogative, the executive must be able to reinterpret and terminate treaties unilaterally. But while the Constitution plainly envisioned the president as the principal negotiator of treaties, it also gave clear responsibilities for treaties to the other branches; all treaties must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate, and once ratified, treaties become “law” enforceable by the courts. The president must certainly be able to interpret treaties in order to “execute” the laws, just as he must be able to interpret statutes for that purpose. But there is no reason why his interpretations of treaties should be any more binding on courts or the legislature than his interpretations of statutes.

The Rule of Law

Yoo’s views on the war and treaty powers share two features. First, they both depart radically from the text of the Constitution. He would reduce the power to “declare War” to a mere formality, a courtesy to the enemy; and he would render entirely superfluous the Supremacy Clause’s provision that treaties are the “Law of the Land.” It is ironic that a president who proclaims his faith in “strict construction” of the Constitution would have found Yoo’s interpretations so persuasive, for Yoo is anything but a strict constructionist. One of the arguments most often made in defense of “originalism” is that interpretations emphasizing a “living” or evolving Constitution are too open-ended, and accordingly they permit judges to stray too far from the text. Yoo unwittingly demonstrates that his brand of originalism is just as vulnerable to that criticism as other approaches, if not more so. He not only departs from the text, but contradicts the principles that underlie it.

Second, and more significantly, all of Yoo’s departures from the text of the Constitution point in one direction — toward eliminating legal checks on presidential power over foreign affairs. He is candid about this, and defends his theory on the ground that it preserves “flexibility” for the executive in foreign affairs. But the specific “flexibility” he seeks to preserve is the flexibility to involve the nation in war without congressional approval, and to ignore and violate international commitments with impunity. As Carlos Vazquez, a professor of law at Georgetown, has argued in response to Yoo, “flexibility has its benefits, but so does precommitment.” The Constitution committed the nation to a legal regime that would make it difficult to go to war and that would provide reliable enforcement of international obligations. Yoo would dispense with both in the name of letting the president have his way.

Even if Yoo is wrong about the original understanding in 1787, is he wrong about 2005? As the subtitle of his book indicates, his argument rests not just on revisionist history, but also on arguments about what is practically necessary in a twenty-first-century world threatened by terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. He contends that these developments demand that the president have the leeway to insulate his foreign policy decisions both from the will of Congress and from the demands of international law.

Here it is worth reviewing the positions Yoo advocated while in the executive branch and since, and their consequences in the “war on terror.” At every turn, Yoo has sought to exploit the “flexibility” he finds in the Constitution to advocate an approach to the “war on terror” in which legal limits are either interpreted away or rejected outright. Just two weeks after the September 11 attacks, Yoo sent an extensive memo to Tim Flanigan, deputy White House counsel, arguing that the President had unilateral authority to use military force not only against the terrorists responsible for the September 11 attacks but against terrorists anywhere on the globe, with or without congressional authorization.

Yoo followed that opinion with a series of memos in January 2002 maintaining, against the strong objections of the State Department, that the Geneva Conventions should not be applied to any detainees captured in the conflict in Afghanistan. Yoo argued that the president could unilaterally suspend the conventions; that al-Qaeda was not party to the treaty; that Afghanistan was a “failed state” and therefore the president could ignore the fact that it had signed the conventions; and that the Taliban had failed to adhere to the requirements of the Geneva Conventions regarding the conduct of war and therefore deserved no protection. Nor, he argued, was the president bound by customary international law, which insists on humane treatment for all wartime detainees. Relying on Yoo’s reasoning, the Bush administration claimed that it could capture and detain any person who the president said was a member or supporter of al-Qaeda or the Taliban, and could categorically deny all detainees the protections of the Geneva Conventions, including a hearing to permit them to challenge their status and restrictions on inhumane interrogation practices.

Echoing Yoo, Alberto Gonzales, then White House counsel, argued at the time that one of the principal reasons for denying detainees protection under the Geneva Conventions was to “preserve flexibility” and make it easier to “quickly obtain information from captured terrorists and their sponsors.” When CIA officials reportedly raised concerns that the methods they were using to interrogate high-level al-Qaeda detainees — such as waterboarding — might subject them to criminal liability, Yoo was again consulted. In response, he drafted the August 1, 2002, torture memo, signed by his superior, Jay Bybee, and delivered to Gonzales. In that memo, Yoo “interpreted” the criminal and international law bans on torture in as narrow and legalistic a way as possible; his evident purpose was to allow government officials to use as much coercion as possible in interrogations.

Yoo wrote that threats of death are permissible if they do not threaten “imminent death,” and that drugs designed to disrupt the personality may be administered so long as they do not “penetrate to the core of an individual’s ability to perceive the world around him.” He said that the law prohibiting torture did not prevent interrogators from inflicting mental harm so long as it was not “prolonged.” Physical pain could be inflicted so long as it was less severe than the pain associated with “serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.”

Even this interpretation did not preserve enough executive “flexibility” for Yoo. In a separate section of the memo, he argued that if these loopholes were not sufficient, the president was free to order outright torture. Any law limiting the president’s authority to order torture during wartime, the memo claimed, would “violate the Constitution’s sole vesting of the Commander-in-Chief authority in the President.”

Since leaving the Justice Department, Yoo has also defended the practice of “extraordinary renditions,” in which the United States has kidnapped numerous “suspects” in the war on terror and “rendered” them to third countries with records of torturing detainees. He has argued that the federal courts have no right to review actions by the president that are said to violate the War Powers Clause. And he has defended the practice of targeted assassinations, otherwise known as “summary executions.”

In short, the flexibility Yoo advocates allows the administration to lock up human beings indefinitely without charges or hearings, to subject them to brutally coercive interrogation tactics, to send them to other countries with a record of doing worse, to assassinate persons it describes as the enemy without trial, and to keep the courts from interfering with all such actions.

Has such flexibility actually aided the U.S. in dealing with terrorism? In all likelihood, the policies and attitudes Yoo has advanced have made the country less secure. The abuses at Guantnamo and Abu Ghraib have become international embarrassments for the United States, and by many accounts have helped to recruit young people to join al-Qaeda. The U.S. has squandered the sympathy it had on September 12, 2001, and we now find ourselves in a world perhaps more hostile than ever before.

With respect to detainees, thanks to Yoo, the U.S. is now in an untenable bind: on the one hand, it has become increasingly unacceptable for the U.S. to hold hundreds of prisoners indefinitely without trying them; on the other hand our coercive and inhumane interrogation tactics have effectively granted many of the prisoners immunity from trial. Because the evidence we might use against them is tainted by their mistreatment, trials would likely turn into occasions for exposing the United States’ brutal interrogation tactics. This predicament was entirely avoidable. Had we given alleged al-Qaeda detainees the fair hearings required by the Geneva Conventions at the outset, and had we conducted humane interrogations at Guantnamo, Abu Ghraib, Camp Mercury, and elsewhere, few would have objected to the U.S. holding some detainees for the duration of the military conflict, and we could have tried those responsible for war crimes. What has been so objectionable to many in the U.S. and abroad is the government’s refusal to accept even the limited constraints of the laws of war.

The consequences of Yoo’s vaunted “flexibility” have been self-destructive for the U.S. — we have turned a world in which international law was on our side into one in which we see it as our enemy. The Pentagon’s National Defense Strategy, issued in March 2005, states,

“Our strength as a nation state will continue to be challenged by those who employ a strategy of the weak, using international fora, judicial processes, and terrorism.”

The proposition that judicial processes — the very essence of the rule of law — are to be dismissed as a strategy of the weak, akin to terrorism, suggests the continuing strength of Yoo’s influence. When the rule of law is seen simply as a device used by terrorists, something has gone perilously wrong. Michael Ignatieff has written that “it is the very nature of a democracy that it not only does, but should, fight with one hand tied behind its back. It is also in the nature of democracy that it prevails against its enemies precisely because it does.” Yoo persuaded the Bush administration to untie its hand and abandon the constraints of the rule of law. Perhaps that is why we are not prevailing.

471826,"The Flu Vaccine Horror Story You Never Heard About

by Bill Sardi

Recently by Bill Sardi: Why Isn’t the H1N1 Pandemic Flu Being Investigated as a DesignedBioweapon?

Pregnant women face an unusual and stressful challenge this year. How do they really know, with all of the outright false and misleading information distributed by public health agencies, that this year’s flu shot is safe?

An online poll reveals 414 of 552 women (75%) would not undergo flu vaccination against the H1N1 pandemic flu. Yet pregnant women are considered to be in a high-risk group for flu-related mortality.

Pregnant women are chatting on internet message boards, and the following reports, if true, are a bit horrifying. Here are some from an About.com site, monitored by Krissi Danielsson. (Numbers refer to the online posting.)

Read this recent posting:

November 3, 2009 at 4:30 pm (8) Connie says: I also received the H1N1 vaccination on October 22nd, 2009 and went into labor on October 25th, at 16 weeks pregnant and we just heard the heartbeat and everything was fine with my pregnancy on October 16th, 2009, then on October 28th my water broke then on October 29th, I delivered a stillborn baby boy, and no one can tell me why…Everyone wants to say it did not come from the shot but I believe it did. My baby was growing at the correct pace and everyone wants to brush off the vaccination. I say if you have the vaccination and suffer a miscarriage if they are able to perform an autopsy have it done.

There are more stories like these:

October 26, 2009 at 11:07 am (2) Regrets says:| I got both vaccines on Thursday. I was 9 weeks pregnant. I miscarried on Sunday. I was told by several doctors to get these vaccines. Now I wish I followed my gut feeling and not get them at ALL!

October 29, 2009 at 8:33 am (3) 🙁 says: I work in a hospital like setting and was told u2018the benefits outweigh the risks"" 1am I got the vaccine, 3am I started bleeding and cramming, 3pm miscarried. You decide

October 31, 2009 at 1:29 pm| (4) sue says: I had the H1N1 vaccination and 24 hours later had a miscarriage

Frankly, these could all be coincidence, but then again, read this posting:

November 6, 2009 at 11:00 am (40) kathy-sd says: I’m from a town of 2000 in SD, there are several women pregnant and we are all due within a few weeks of each other. Four of us got the H1N1 vaccine 2 weeks ago and one by one each of us started to have preterm contractions. We are all due in Nov and Dec so we are further along than most of the people that lost their babies. There is no way you can tell us that our preterm labor was not caused by the H1N1 vaccine. It may look like a ""fluke"" to some people when these women are scattered all over the country but we are talking about 4 of us in our small community. My heart goes out to all of you that lost your babies.

There are more pregnancy/flu-shot horror stories involving stillbirths you can find here.

Yet pregnant women have been told that the vaccine is safe and they are told they are in a high-risk group for flu-related mortality. (Flu-related death does not appear to be due to the flu but rather the treatment for the flu. See here.)

The H1N1 pandemic vaccine has only recently undergone testing in pregnant females. A report says ""To date, the vaccine appears to be well-tolerated, and no safety concerns related to the vaccine have arisen.""

Poland rejects the vaccine

But a health minister in Poland speaks out on YouTube, stating that there are numerous websites for manufacturers of this year’s H1N1 pandemic flu vaccine, yet she cannot find reports of any unwanted side effects for these vaccines. Poland has elected to avoid use of the vaccine among pregnant women.

Polish health minister Zdrowia challenges her medical colleagues: ""I would like you to visit any of these (vaccine manufacturer) websites and find any unwanted side effect. Any slightest thing, at least one, like allergical skin rash. That can happen even with using the safest medicine. There are none on those websites. It is a u2018perfect medicine’.""

She then goes on to ask, why, if this vaccine is perfectly safe, do manufacturers seek exemption from legal recourse by patients harmed by the vaccine?

Warm weather is here  almost  at last.

Is your car ready?

Check the tires

People know about keeping track of tread depth but sometimes forget to examine their vehicles tires for signs of physical damage  such as bulges on the sidewall or rips/tears  things that can be caused by hitting a bad pothole or bumping up against a curb. Such damage often happens during the winter months  but isnt noticed because its just too cold outside to get on your hands and knees and take a close look at each tire. But now that its getting warm out, its a good idea to do a walk around. Any tire that has a bulge on its sidewall or any evidence of physical damage should be replaced as soon as possible.

Clean the crevices

Door sills/jambs, trunk undersides; the inner fenders and undercarriage are places where winter gunk tends to accumulate. Its not just unsightly, either. The gunk can prevent proper drainage/drying-out, which can accelerate body rot. Caustic compounds such as road salt are also hard on rubber seals/weatherstripping. Its a good idea to wipe down the inner door jambs/trunk underside and run the car through the undercarriage wash at your local automatic car wash (or you can do it yourself with a garden hose). Door/trunk weatherstripping will stay pliable and soft longer, too, if you wipe it down with a rubber protectant.

Replace your wiper blades

New wiper blades are cheap and easy to install  one of the few such things you can say about car maintenance these days. If you live in a four seasons climate, wiper blades should be replaced at least twice a year  once in fall and then again, in spring. Or even sooner, if you notice theyre doing more streaking than cleaning. This is a (usually) no-tools-required/DIY job that almost anyone can handle. And if you dont want to handle it, the auto parts stores that sell blades will often install them for you, free. Just ask.

Try your air conditioner

Do it now  before it gets hot. And before every repair shop in town has a backlog of two weeks because of the vast legions of people who discovered their ACs not working, either  and dropped off their cars for repair work. AC systems  especially on cars more than four or five years old  sometimes have very minor leaks that, over time, result in loss of refrigerant, which results in loss of cooling power. Also, long periods of disuse such as over the winter season can lead to other problems such as a sticky compressor clutch (this is why its smart to run your AC a couple of times a month for 5-10 minutes at a time during the winter months) that wont become obvious until that first really hot day when you turn on the AC  and all you get is warm air. So, make sure your cars AC is blowing cold now, before you really need it  and get it fixed before everyone else realizes they need to get theirs fixed, too.

Polish your headlights

Most late model cars have clear-plastic headlight assemblies instead of the sealed beam glass headlights cars used to come with. The upside is these plastic headlight assemblies look better and (when new) usually give you better night-time illumination. The downside is the plastic tends to yellow or become cloudy as the car ages, and this looks bad and also reduces the effectiveness of the lights, too. But the fix is fairly easy. Get some polish wax and a soft rag. Use the polish wax to buff out the plastic. It will safely remove the outer yellowed/opaque layers and restore your headlights to like-new look and function. Specialty kits are also available to do this job that include UV sealers to help keep the headlights looking great (and lighting right) longer.

Hose off your radiator

Your cars radiator is really a heat exchanger. Engine heat is transferred to liquid coolant, which circulates through the radiator, where heat is taken away by the flow of air over thin cooling fins. But if dirt  and dead bugs and leaves/debris  cake onto the radiators surface, it becomes less capable of shedding heat. Its harder for the fan to draw air through the radiator, which reduces its efficiency. The fix is easy  and free. Just get out your garden hose, pop the hood and  with the engine cold  thoroughly hose down the radiator, paying particular attention to the front (facing away from the engine) because thats the section that acts as a bug-catcher and grime collector, too.

One problem with labeling ideological movements “old” or “new” is that inevitably, with the passage of time, the “new” becomes an “old” and the markers get confusing. In the modern, post-World War II right wing, there have been a number of “news” and “olds” over the past half-century. But what I call the “Old Right” has an excellent claim to that label; for it was the original, oldest right, and it was in many ways radically different from all the rights that have followed after its demise.

The original right of which I speak, and of which I am one of the few survivors, stretched from 1933 to its approximate death, or fading away, upon the advent of National Review in 1955. The Old Right began in 1933 in response to the coming of the New Deal. It was “reactionary” in the best and most generous sense: it was a horrified reaction against the Roosevelt Revolution, against the Great Leap Forward toward collectivism that enraptured socialist intellectuals and enraged those who were devoted to the institutions and the strict limitations on centralized government power that marked the Old Republic.

Last fall, David Lauter, writing a think-piece in the Los Angeles Times about the Clinton health plan, wittingly or unwittingly echoed Maoist terminology about this Great Leap Forward, declaring that “every so often… the government collectively braces itself, takes a deep breath, and leaps into a largely unknown future.” The Clinton health plan is such a leap, Lauter noted; the previous Great Leap was the civil rights laws of the 1960s; and before that, in perhaps the primordial leap, was the New Deal of the 1930s, when the nation agreed “to give the federal government a whole new set of responsibilities  from providing social security for the elderly to establishing a new system of national regulatory agencies to monitor the economy.”

A fairly good summation, except that instead of the “nation” agreeing to give powers to the government the New Deal proceeded in the manner of all nonviolent revolutions: it was the federal government and its new rulers that seized power, drove through a flurry of socialistic measures, and then won “agreement” by using the levers of propaganda and opinion-molding in society, as well as by relying on the sheer force of inertia and habit once the new institutions were in place.

The Old, original, Right realized the horrors of the New Deal and predicted the collectivist road on which it was setting the nation. The Old Right was a coalition of ideologies and forces that did not have one single, common, positive program, but “negatively” it was solidly united: all opposed the New Deal and were committed to its total repeal and abolition  lock, stock, and barrel. The fact that its unity was “negative” did not make it any less strong or cohesive: for there was total agreement on rolling back this collective excrescence and on restoring the Old Republic, the true America.

The Old Right coalition consisted of the following elements. Most “extreme” were the libertarian and individualist writers and intellectuals: H. L. Mencken, Albert Jay Nock, Rose Wilder Lane, Garet Garrett, all people who had resisted what they believed to be the mounting statism of the Republican regime of the 1920s and who called for an ultraminimal government that would have rolled back the statism of the Progressive period, the Civil War and Reconstruction eras, and perhaps the judicial despotism of Chief Justice John Marshall. Next came now virtually forgotten remnants of the conservative, states’ rights Democrats of the nineteenth century, largely from the South, whose views were almost as libertarian as the first group’s. These men were led by Governor Albert Ritchie of Maryland, who was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1932, and Senator James A. Reed from Missouri. The third group consisted of conservative Republicans who were outraged at New Deal democracy and who largely came from the Midwest. Former Progressives and statists, who believed that the New Deal was going much too far, formed the final group; its leader was former President Herbert Hoover, who, though he had launched many New Deal measures in microcosm in his own administration, denounced the New Deal for going too far into “fascism.” It was the first group that set the tone, since individualist and libertarian rhetoric provided the only general concepts with which New Deal measures could be opposed. The result, however, was that hack Republican politicians found themselves mouthing libertarian and antistatist slogans that they did not really believe  a condition that set the stage for a later “moderation” and abandonment of their seemingly cherished principles.

Unity in our hostility and hatreds, however, combined with diversity of positive principle, had a healthy effect on the Old Right. It meant that we could unite and act together in denouncing and moving against the New Deal enemy, while disagreeing and arguing in friendly fashion among ourselves about the kind of America we would ultimately like to achieve. How much government did we wish to roll back? Stop at 1932, or press onward to repeal Progressive measures or even the centralization of the nineteenth century? We were all committed to states’ rights, but how far did we want to carry this view? A few libertarian extremists wanted to go all the way back to the Articles of Confederation, but the great bulk of the right was committed to the United States Constitution  but a Constitution construed so “strictly” as to outlaw much twentieth-century legislation, certainly on the federal level.

In those days, it was a pleasure to pore over the voting records of right-wing Republicans in Congress, especially in the harder-core House, for the common garden-variety rightists of the pre-1955 era make the most right-wing congressmen today seem impossibly leftist and socialistic. My two favorite congressmen were Howard Buffett of Nebraska and Frederick C. Smith of Ohio, both of whom would invariably draw “zero” ratings from the Americans for Democratic Action and other leftist groups. I remember being disappointed that once in a while they might deviate by favoring a federal anti-lynching bill; did they not know that the federal government is not supposed to have any police powers?

Friendly disagreement on positive principles meant genuine and healthy diversity and freedom of discussion within right-wing circles. As Thomas Fleming noted with astonishment when researching the Old Right, there was no party line, and there was no organ or central GHQ that excommunicated “unrespectable” members. There was a wide spectrum of positive views: ranging from pure libertarian decentralization to Hamilitonian reliance on strong government within rigid limits to various wings of monarchists. And in all this diversity and range of discourse, no one would react in shock and horror to any “extreme” views  so long as the “extremism” did not mean selling out the fight against the New Deal. There was also a great deal of disagreement on specific policies that had been open questions in the Old, pre-New Deal, Republic: tariffs vs. free trade; immigration restrictions vs. open borders; and what constitutes a military or foreign policy truly consistent with American national interests.

The Old Right experienced one big sea change. Originally, its focus was purely domestic, since that was the concentration of the early New Deal. But as the Roosevelt administration moved toward world war in the late 1930s, the Old Right added intense opposition to the New Deal’s war policies to its systemic opposition to the domestic New Deal revolution. For they realized that, as the libertarian Randolph Bourne had put it in opposing America’s entry into World War I, “War is the health of the State” and that entry into large-scale war, especially for global and not national concerns, would plunge America into a permanent garrison state that would wreck American liberty and constitutional limits at home even as it extended the American imperium abroad. As anti-foreign interventionism was added to the anti-New Deal mix, the Old Right lost some adherents and gained even more. For Eastern Establishment anti-New Dealers, such as Lewis Douglas, William L. Clayton, Dean Acheson, and the Morgan Bank, embraced the entire New Deal package once it came wrapped in the enticing trappings of American Empire. On the other hand, antiwar progressives, originally New Dealers, men such as Senators William Borah and Gerald Nye, intellectuals and writers such as John T. Flynn and Harry Elmer Barnes, began to realize that there was something very wrong with a strong state that could expand into foreign adventures, and so they gradually became anti-New Dealers in every sense of the word.

World War II added foreign policy to the mix, so that by the end of the war, the Old Right was opposed to big government on every front, foreign and domestic. All parts of the right were opposed to global crusading, to what Clare Booth Luce wittily labeled “globaloney.” They were opposed to what the former New Deal historian-turned-noninterventionist Charles A. Beard labeled the foreign policy of “perpetual war for perpetual peace.”

There have been many memoirs about being Jewish and growing up in New York in the 1930s and 1940s. Although I am a few years younger than most of the memoirists  Irving Howe, Irving Kristol, Alfred Kazin, etc.  my experience was in many ways the same. It was great being a Walker in the City in that bygone era. New York street life was vital and fun. There was no harassment, no sense of crime lurking around every corner. Whites would go up to the Apollo Theater in Harlem to watch Pearl Bailey and other great entertainers with no sense of fear whatsoever. There were no bums or aggressive beggars on the street; if anyone wanted to see a bum, they could go to a short street downtown called the Bowery, where bums or “winos” hung out. And even they were not strictly “homeless,” as they lived in very cheap Bowery hotels. The streets teemed with fascinating characters hawking their nostrums and ideologies. Soapboxes in Union Square or Columbus Circle featured any speaker who wanted to get up and address the crowd. I remember with affection one elderly guy working the streets in the Wall Street area, earnestly hawking the idea that lemonade or lemon juice was the panacea for all bodily ills. And at that time, New York was studded with inexpensive cafeterias, where one could sit nursing a cup of coffee for hours and either read or discuss ideas undisturbed. One guy came to be called “Senator Mendel,” from spending most of his hours in the Senator Cafeteria on the Upper West Side. Nowadays, of course, such cafeterias would be filled with aggressive bums and muggers, and quiet or discourse would be impossible.

Looking back on it all, the discussions and arguments I got into, whether in street, neighborhood, family, or school, were marked by an instinctive civility and courtesy. Even though there were lots of communists around, there were no angry squads of enforcers of political correctness or threats to send you to brainwashing or sensitivity training sessions. And even though I was, with the exception of my father, virtually the only rightist I knew personally, I was uniformly treated not with hostility but rather with reactions ranging from astonishment to amused affection.

The one important aspect in which my growing up differed from these other Jewish memoirists, of course, is that they were some species of communist or socialist, whereas I was a right-winger and bitterly antisocialist from the very beginning. I grew up in a communist culture; the middle-class Jews in New York whom I lived among, whether family, friends, or neighbors, were either communists or fellow-travelers in the communist orbit. I had two sets of Communist Party uncles and aunts, on both sides of the family. But more important, the one great moral question in the lives of all these people was: Should I actually join the Communist Party and devote the whole of my life to the cause, or should I remain a fellow-traveler and “selfishly” devote only a fraction of my energy to communism? That was it; any species of liberalism, let alone conservatism, was nonexistent. And, contrary to the fond memories of Kristol, Howe, Kazin et al., I never heard of a Trotskyist in this period. Trotskyism was confined to a few intellectuals and future academics; for middle-class New York Jewry, the political world revolved around the C.P. (In later years, there was a reality-based joke on the left: “Whatever happened to the Old Left? The Trotskyites went into academia, and the Stalinists went into real estate."")

The one exception to this communist milieu was my father, David. My father emigrated to the United States from a Polish shetl in 1910, impoverished and knowing not a word of English. Like most immigrants of that era, he had resolved “to become an American” in every sense. And that meant, for him, not only learning English and making it his language, but also abandoning Yiddish papers and culture and purging himself of any foreign accent. It also meant devotion to the basic American Way: minimal government, belief in and respect for free enterprise and private property, and a determination to rise by one’s own merits and not via government privilege or handout. Russian and Polish Jews before World War I were swept with communist, socialist, and Zionist ideologies and movements, or blends of the three. But my father never fell for any of them. An individualist rather than a socialist or tribalist, he believed his loyalty was to America rather than to Zionism or to any Zionist entity in the Middle East.

I grew up in the same spirit. All socialism seemed to me monstrously coercive and abhorrent. In one family gathering featuring endless pledges of devotion to “Loyalist” Spain during the Civil War, I piped up, at the age of eleven or twelve, “What’s wrong with Franco, anyway?” It didn’t seem to me that Franco’s sins, however statist, were any worse, to put it mildly, than those of the Republicans. My query was a conversation-stopper, all right, but I never received an answer.

When I shifted in early grades from the debasing and egalitarian public school system to a private school that I enjoyed a great deal, I found myself in another odd ideological climate. In those days, girls of the wealthier classes were protected, and so they were sent to a day school in New York, whereas upper-class boys were sent out of town to boarding school. The private day school I attended was coed, but it had difficulty attracting boys and was in danger of falling into all-girls status. As a result, they gave scholarships to bright, middle-class boys. The result was socially anomalous: the girls were all wealthy, driven to and from school in chauffeured limousines, whereas at least half the boys were scholarship lads such as myself. Another fascinating note was that the students were mostly, though not solely, Jewish, whereas the staff and instructors were all WASPs. None of the Jewish students felt oppressed by this situation; indeed, none of us felt aggrieved when every Friday we attended chapel, nondenominational to be sure, but singing glorious Christian hymns. None of the Jewish students felt anything but happily assimilated into what America  which was, after all, a WASP and Christian country  was all about.

But while none of my fellow high school students was a communist, they were all left-liberals, what came to be called in New York “Park Avenue” or “limousine” liberals  all too literally in their case. I soon became established as the school conservative, arguing strongly in the eighth grade against Roosevelt’s introduction of the capital-gains tax in 1938 and later against Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia’s left-wing policy of coddling criminals.

My reputation as the high school rightist came in handy. In my junior year in high school, I was the supporter, in one of those meaningless school elections, of my friend Lloyd Marcus for school president or speaker or whatever the post was called. We thought we would be up-to-date politicos, so we happily had handbills printed up: “Lloyd Marcus: Charges and Facts.” All the “issues” were trivial. There was nothing ideological about them; only personal friendships were at stake. But tough old Miss Birch, the school founder, scented “communism” and “strike” at the very sign of a handbill. (Lloyd Marcus was the son of the fabulously wealthy Bernard K. Marcus, who had gone to jail as part of the Bank of the United States scandal. Lloyd was indeed a “Park Avenue leftist,” but the difference between the pro-Marcus and anti-Marcus camp was trivial and irrelevant to the election.) The ringleaders in the Marcus camp were called into Miss Birch’s office one by one and quizzed sternly about “communism” and whether we were affiliated with the American Student Union, the communist student front at that time. I assured Miss Birch that no “strike” or Student Union thought was in any of our minds. In the event, all of the Marcus ringleaders (including the now-distinguished concert pianist and music historian Charles Rosen) were expelled, except myself. The idea that the school rightist was a commie was unthinkable.

When I entered Columbia during World War II for college and graduate school, the universe of people I met expanded, but the political ambience remained the same. Everyone was either a communist or a social democrat, or a variety of each. The only other Republican student at Columbia was an English major, and so we had little in common, as I was increasingly steeped in economics, both for its own sake and because it seemed to me that the knottiest political problems and the strongest arguments for socialism and statism were economic, dwelling on the alleged failures of free-market capitalism. The more I engaged in debates and discussion with fellow students and professors, who were all some variety of leftist, the more conservative I became.

I was so far out of it politically on campus that sometimes I served as a kind of father-confessor. One time, someone I knew only slightly came to see me and poured out a tale of woe. (He was later to become a sociologist.) “Murray, you know I have been active in many liberal causes. Well, today, I was stunned, I don’t know what to do. All my friends whom I thought were regular liberals came to me and invited me to join their cell of the Communist Party. I had no idea they were communists! What should I do? Should I join?”

What can you say to a mere acquaintance who spills out this kind of confession? I do not remember how I reacted, probably with some sort of cliché like “to thine own self be true” or “don’t let anyone intimidate you.” I never knew what he decided, but I am reasonably certain that he decided not to be sucked into the C.P.

During this period, I knew that there was a right-wing movement out there, but my knowledge was confined to such grand newspaper organs as the Hearst press, the marvelous New York Sun, and reports about Congress. For a while, after the war, I was perhaps the only New Yorker outside of libraries to subscribe to my favorite newspaper, the Chicago Tribune, which, in the grand old Colonel Robert McCormick era, was hard right throughout, not just in its editorial pages but in its reportorial staff as well. I had not yet, however, met any other rightist.

Finally, in 1946, I discovered the Old Right personally by finding the new Foundation for Economic Education (FEE) at Irvington-on-Hudson, New York, where I met the movement intellectuals and activists and was introduced to wonderful Old Right literature I had never heard of  libertarians Albert Jay Nock and H. L. Mencken, Frank Chodorov, John T. Flynn, and Garet Garrett  and all this very rapidly converted me from a free-market economist to a purist libertarian. This literature also converted me to hard-core isolationism in foreign policy. I had never really thought much about foreign policy, being steeped in economics, but now I realized that a non-interventionist foreign policy was part and parcel of a devotion to freedom and resistance to statism.

Libertarians in the post-World War II right naturally thought of themselves as “extreme right-wingers” amid the right-wing spectrum. There was no enmity between us and the less extreme or less pure; we were all happy to work together in the anti-New Deal cause: we were trying to get our less extreme allies to be more consistent; they were trying to get us to be more “pragmatic.” Even in party politics, a purist libertarian like Congressman Howard Buffet (R-NE), whom I got to know personally, rose to become Senator Taft’s Midwestern campaign manager at the ill-fated 1952 Republican Convention. I became a member of the Young Republican Club of New York in 1946 and wrote its policy paper blasting Harry Truman’s price controls on meat, which he was forced to repeal during the 1946 campaign. I was astonished in later years to see “conservatives” hail Harry Truman as a model president: on the contrary, we opposed Truman hip and thigh, for his domestic statism as well as for his interventionist foreign policy. Indeed, one of my happiest political moments came when the Republicans swept both houses of Congress in the November 1946 election on the slogan, “controls, corruption, and communism.” My first foray into print was a letter I sent to the Scripps Howard New York World Telegram celebrating the Republican victory, saying “Hallelujah!” and naïvely expecting the Republican Congress to promptly repeal the entire New Deal. Well they said they would, didn’t they?

The first disillusion of many set in quickly. The National Association of Manufacturers, before that pledged to repeal the entire socialistic and pro-union Wagner Act, caved in, at their winter 1946 meeting, to the “responsible” corporate elements (read the “enlightened” Rockefeller-type forces) and changed their tune to call for what finally did occur: not repealing but extending the powers of the federal government to apply criteria of “fairness” to unions as well as employers. In short: to extend government power over labor relations instead of removing it completely. And with the NAM acquiescence, the Republicans, led by Senator Taft (a brilliant man but someone who was, disastrously, philosophically  and not just tactically  devoted to compromise), went along with this new sell-out position and passed the amending Taft-Hartley Act instead of abolishing the entire Wagner Act. Politically, repeal might have succeeded, since the public was fed up with unions and strikes in 1946, and they had, after all, elected a rightwing Republican Congress. Also in this 80th Congress, the Republicans largely abandoned their “isolationist,” noninterventionist principles, led by their foreign affairs committee head, renegade isolationist Senator Arthur Vandenberg (R-MI), who managed to establish the first, disastrous “bipartisan foreign policy,” i.e., global interventionism, in the post-World War II era.

Old Right Republicans, the soul of the party, always managed to lose the presidential nomination, perpetually stolen from them by the Eastern Establishment-Big Banker-Rockefeller wing of the party, who used their media clout, as well as hardball banker threats to call in the delegates’ loans, to defeat majority sentiment in the party. In 1940, a Morgan bank blitz managed to steal the presidential nomination for the unknown utility magnate and leftist Republican Wendell Wilkie from Old Right isolationist Senator Taft and Tom Dewey, all his political life a Rockefeller stooge, who in 1940 followed what was then the isolationist Rockefeller line. In 1944, Dewey, now an internationalist following the Rockefellers’ shift, won the Republican nomination. He was renominated in 1948, beating out the Old Right isolationist Senator John W. Bricker (R-OH) for the nomination, Bricker getting the consolation post of vice president.

As far as I was concerned, Dewey’s nomination completed the congressional sellout, and even though I was unhappy that Truman ran a demagogic leftist campaign against the 80th Congress, I could not bring myself to support Dewey. Hence, once again naïvely, I embraced the new states’ rights or “Dixiecrat” ticket of Strom Thurmond for president and Fielding Wright of Mississippi for vice president. I actually believed that the States’ Rights Party would continue to become a major party and destroy what was then a one-party Democratic monopoly in the South. In that way, an Old Right, Midwestern Republican coalition with States’ Rights Democrats could become the majority party!

At Columbia graduate school, I founded a Students for Thurmond group. I showed up at the first meeting, which consisted of a group of Southern students and one New York Jew, myself. There were a brace of other New York Jews there, but they were all observers from the Henry Wallace Progressive Party, puzzled and anxious to find out to what extent fascism and the Ku Klux Klan had permeated the fair Columbia campus. They were especially bewildered when I got up at the meeting and made a fiery stump speech on behalf of states’ rights and against centralized socialism. What was a nice Jewish boy doing in a place like this?

I have been asked many times whether the Old Right was rife with anti-Semitism. Left-wing undercover operators and smear artists such as “John Roy Carlson” had written a best-selling work, Under Cover, tarring all anti-New Dealers and America Firsters with the anti-Semitic and “neo-Nazi” brush, and the reputation of the Old Right has grown worse over the years, since, as usual, the interpretation of history has been solely in the hands of the internationalist winners.

The answer to this question, however, is a resounding No. In my decade on the Old Right, I never once encountered any anti-Semitic hostility. It is true there were unfortunately very few Jews on the Old Right, but those that were there  notably the great libertarian Frank Chodorov  were widely admired and encountered no ethnic hostility. It is true that there was a general unhappiness with the fact that most Jews seemed to be leftists, as well as widespread opposition to the Zionist program of driving Palestinian Arabs out of their lands and homes, but these were attitudes that I myself fully shared.

The Old Right finally began to fade away over the issue of the Cold War. All Old Rightists were fervently anticommunist, knowing full well that the communists had played a leading role in the later years of the New Deal and in getting us into World War II. But we believed that the main threat was not the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, but socialism and collectivism here at home, a threat that would escalate if we engaged in still another Wilsonian-Rooseveltian global crusade, this time against the Soviet Union and its client states. Most Old Rightists, therefore, fervently opposed the Cold War, including the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, and the quasi-debacle of the Korean War. Indeed, while the entire left, with the exception of the Communist Party, got behind the Korean War as opposition to North Korean “aggression” under the cover of the United Nations, the Old Right, particularly its hard-core members in the House of Representatives, led by the Chicago Tribune, opposed all of these policies to the hilt. Howard Buffett, for example, was one of the major voices in Congress opposed to the Korean adventure.

By the mid-1950s, however, the Old Right began to fade away. Senator Taft was robbed of the Republican nomination in 1952 by a Rockefeller-Morgan Eastern banker cabal, using their control of respectable “Republican” media. In the early 1950s, Taft himself and the doughty Colonel McCormick passed away, and the veteran Old Right leaders faded from the scene. The last gasp of the Old Right in foreign policy was the defeat of the Bricker Amendment to the Constitution in 1954, an amendment that would have prevented international treaties from overriding American rights and powers. The amendment was sabotaged by the Eisenhower administration.

Finally, the Old Right was buried by the advent in late 1955 of the lively weekly National Review, a well-edited periodical that filled the ideological vacuum resulting from the deaths of McCormick and Taft and the retirement of other isolationist stalwarts. National Review set out successfully to transform the American right from an isolationist defender of the Old Republic to a global crusader against the Soviet Union and international communism. After National Review became established as the GHQ of the right, it proceeded to purge all rightwing factions that had previously lived and worked in harmony but now proved too isolationist or too unrespectable for the newly transformed Buckleyite right. These purges paved the way for later changes of line as well as future purges: of those who opposed anti-Stalinist, pro-welfare state liberals called “neoconservatives,” as well as of those who persisted in opposing the crippling of property rights in the name of “civil” and other victimological “rights.”

As time passed and Old Right heroes passed away and were forgotten, many of the right-wing rank-and-file, never long on historical memory, forgot and adapted their positions to the new dispensation. The last political manifestation of the Old Right was the third-party Andrews-Werdel ticket of 1956, which called for the repeal of the income tax and the rollback of the New Deal. Its foreign policy was the last breath of the pre-Cold War Old Right: advocating no foreign war, the Bricker Amendment, and the abolition of foreign aid. The betrayal of Senator Taft in 1952 had driven me out of the Republican Party, and after supporting the Andrews-Werdel ticket, I spent the following decades in the political wilderness, trying to join abortive third “Constitutional” parties and to separate libertarians out from a right wing that I no longer recognized and that seemed to me far closer to the hated New Deal, domestic and foreign, than to its Old Right enemy, which I had happily discovered and embraced in the years just after World War II.

Rothbard (19261995), the founder of modern libertarianism and the dean of the Austrian School of economics, was the author of The Ethics of Liberty and For a New Liberty and many other books and articles. He was also academic vice president of the Ludwig von Mises Institute and the Center for Libertarian Studies, and the editor  with Lew Rockwell  of The Rothbard-Rockwell Report.

218889,"To: Bob Schulz From: Gary North Re: Your fast unto death against the IRS

Your decision to begin a fast on July 1 reveals a dedication that few people possess. But you have made a bad decision. I pray that you will reverse yourself, not out of fear or discomfort, but out of principle.

The Internal Revenue Service is on every American freedom-lover’s list of the first five organizations to abolish. It feeds the Beast. The income tax should be abolished. It should not be resurrected. The IRS should be limited to, at most, taxing other branches of civil government. We the people should have no direct dealings with the IRS. But, of course, such is not the case.

Your Web site proclaims that the income tax was brought into existence illegally. The evidence does indicate that the Sixteenth Amendment was not ratified according to law. Bill Benson and Red Beckman made this case in their 1985 book, The Law That Never Was. (Who knows? Maybe someday Mr. Benson will do us the enormous favor-for a profit, no less- of publishing the full documentation on-line or on a CD-ROM. I would be happy to buy a copy.)

The subsequent legislation that created the IRS is, at best, muddled. You think that it was never passed. Your decision to challenge the IRS on its legality is surely legitimate.

But there is always the question of means. Is your threat of self-starvation legitimate? Is it even rational? It will get some publicity for your cause. It may not get enough publicity to force the IRS to meet with you publicly on September 21. You cannot be sure. You have said that you will not stop your fast until IRS officials meet with you and answer your questions publicly. But they may decide to ignore you. Then what?

A rational tactic has a plan. A one-man stand had better have a constituency in mind. An obvious constituency that you should attempt to mobilize is this one: members of a tiny handful of conservative Christian churches. The pastors of mainline churches and most evangelical churches will ignore you. They will not risk a confrontation with the IRS, which might revoke their churches’ tax-exempt status. You must therefore go over the heads of the pastors to the members.

Christians will see your tactic as literally suicidal. All branches of the church throughout history have placed suicide in the category of a mortal sin or its equivalent in the particular denominational tradition. Suicide is seen as murder: the deliberate destruction of God’s image in man. The church has always said that each man belongs to God, and God therefore places limits on killing. This includes self-killing.

Your decision to place your life on the line, on your own authority, will be regarded by Christians who hear about your stand as morally wrong and tactically misguided. You do your cause enormous harm by adopting such a tactic.

Then there is the question of the magnitude of the threat to our liberty posed by the IRS. This agency should not be at the top of any freedom-loving American’s list of institutions to be eliminated. Decades ago, R. J. Rushdoony made the point that any call for a tax revolt is futile in modern American society. This nation has for too long placed enormous faith in government-run schools. He concluded: “Americans have willingly tithed their children to the State. They are not about to take a stand against the mere confiscation of their money.”

The public schools are America’s only established church. Rushdoony made this point in his book, The Messianic Character of American Education, in 1963. Sidney E. Mead, a liberal church historian, made the same point in the same year in his book, The Lively Experiment. The public schools are where most Americans’ public faith lodges. You should not waste your efforts in a vain hope of shutting down the IRS until after the worship of the State in these secular churches ends.

The public school system operated for over a century without funds collected by the IRS and distributed by the U.S. Treasury. Even today, federal subsidies to state and local education are only a small fraction of the total funding of the tax-funded schools. The IRS is not our primary target. Shut down the IRS without first shutting down the public schools, and the Beast will recover.

There is another underlying error in your tactic: your abiding faith in salvation by law. You seem to think that a technicality in the law will save America from the tyranny of the IRS. But the letter of any law is interpreted by politicians dressed in black robes. You are operating under the naive assumption that the federal courts are ready to cut off the source of their own funding. That the IRS’s own administrative law court will decide against you is obvious. I have in mind a Constitutional court. The judges are not about to commit institutional suicide. They would much prefer to have you commit literal suicide.

We live in a nation so utterly blinded by the doctrine of the absolute authority of federal judges that a declaration by eight of them that it is illegal for states to prohibit abortion persuaded the vast majority of American voters, including Christians, that nothing could be done about it. They shrugged their shoulders and dutifully went on with earning a living and paying their taxes.

Why do you believe that these people are ready to join you in a tax revolt based on a legal technicality? Most of them will never hear of you, and if they do, they will think “nut case.”

You are not Gandhi. This is not India.

Today’s tax laws are the visible manifestation of Americans’ deeply entrenched involvement in the politics of plunder. Our tax laws are consistent with this national faith in the power of the State to redistribute wealth by force.

You may have found an ancient glitch in the letter of the tax laws, but the spirit of these laws is universal. A jury of your peers would probably convict you if you put the case before them. As surely as the Israelites of Samuel’s day paid no attention to his warning that the king would extract a tithe from their production (I Samuel 8:15-17), so are today’s voters and jurors.

The spirit of the law is our problem. The letter of the law may protect this or that person from a specific act of government tyranny, but it should not be expected to protect taxpayers from themselves.

I implore you to continue your struggle by other means. Call off your fast. Use your Web site to make your case that the tax laws are rigged and technically illegitimate. Move your argument from the verifiable facts of illegal acts by politicians and their appointed bureaucrats to the broader issue of immoral law and immoral voters, who believe in a rewritten Mosaic commandment:

“Thou shalt not steal, except by majority vote.”

221149,"Last September, about 60 Vermonters met in the chambers of the house of representatives in Montpelier to celebrate the states independence spirit and to discuss the goals of environmental sustainability, economic justice, and Vermont self-determination. The speaker of the house had given up the space free of charge for the one-day conference. First at the podium was a Princeton-educated yak farmer and professor of journalism named Rob Williams, one of the organizers of the event, who at 9 A.M. opened the proceedings by acknowledging what he called some unpleasant and hard truths. Amid the twin global crises of peak oil and climate change, the United States was an out-of-control empire. It was unresponsive to the needs, concerns, and desires of ordinary citizens.

Williams, who wore a T-shirt that said U.S. Out of Vermont, did not advocate revolution. He was looking for a divorce. He wanted Vermont to secede. Nonviolent secession, he said, the detaching from empire and exercising our rights to independence, a deeply American right first expressed in the Declaration of Independence, is a right that demands re-exploration today. Williams noted that Vermont is one of only three states, along with Texas and Hawaii, that ever existed as an independent republic  in Vermonts case, from 1777 to 1791  and that as a national leader on progressive political issues, the state was uniquely poised to lead this national conversation on self-determination.

The murmuring response from the crowd suggested theyd heard it before. Williams and his fellow travelers  who constituted not quite a movement, he said, but more a network of critical observers  had been calling for separation from the U.S. since 2003. They had gathered in the ornate rooms of the state house to spread the word in 2005 and again in 2008 and now in 2012. Vermont had not yet separated, but the secessionists who were calling for a Second Vermont Republic had gained notoriety, and some small influence, across the state.

The conferences attendees included an ecofeminist named Lierre Keith, co-author of Deep Green Resistance, who reported that capitalism is literally insane and urged the collapse of industrial civilization; a man in a kaffiyeh who enthused over a recent story about a rural Vermonter who, faced with police harassment over his use of marijuana, mounted his tractor, drove into town, and crushed seven sheriffs cruisers under the treads of the behemoth machine; a musician who sang a tune called Totalitarian Democracy; a thespian garbed in 18th-century blouse and boots and cravat who re-enacted Ethan Allen, the farmer-soldier who led Vermonts war of secession against New York in 1777; and a troupe of female dancers from the radical Bread and Puppet Theater, dressed all in white, who chanted a series of poems about upriser calisthenics.

The mornings keynote speaker, historian and author Morris Berman, drew on his latest book, Why America Failed. As he writes, The principal goal of North American civilization is and always has been an ever-expanding economy  affluence  and endless technological innovation  progress. Thats made us a nation of hustlers a people relentlessly on the make. The hustling mentality, seeing no limits to acquisitiveness, founded on the delusion of permanent growth  otherwise known as the American Dream  produced permanent instability and crisis. A nation of hustlers, argued Berman, was bound to fail. It could do nothing else.

Williams was nodding along. Only in Vermont, he told me, would a legislature allow this sort of thing on its floor.

During the Obama years, secession has mostly been an antic folly of the political right, courtesy of Texas nationalists, Dixie nostalgists, white supremacists, sovereign citizens, and gun nuts. There was no small amount of hypocrisy, of course, in this conservative rebellion. When Texas Governor Rick Perry in 2009 spoke publicly about a possible Lone Star secession, he billed it as a constitutional right in the face of overreaching government  though Republicans mostly hadnt complained when George W. Bush was demanding profligate budgets and stabbing the sacred document with pencil holes.

Yet here in granola-eating, hyper-lefty, Subaru-driving Vermont was a secession effort that had been loud during the Bush years, had not ceased its complaining under Barack Obama, did not care for party affiliation, and had welcomed into its midst gun nuts and lumberjacks and professors, socialists and libertarians and anarchists, ex-Republicans and ex-Democrats, truck drivers and schoolteachers and waitresses, students and artists and musicians and poets, farmers and hunters and wooly-haired woodsmen. The manifesto that elaborated their platform was read at the conference: a 1,400-word mouthful that echoed the Declaration of Independence in its petition of grievances. [T]ransnational megacompanies and big government, it proclaimed, control us through money, markets, and media, sapping our political will, civil liberties, collective memory, traditional cultures. The document was signed by, among others, its principal authors, a professor emeritus of economics at Duke University named Thomas Naylor and the decentralist philosopher Kirkpatrick Sale, author of Human Scale. Citizens, it concluded, lend your name to this manifesto and join in the honorable task of rejecting the immoral, corrupt, decaying, dying, failing American Empire and seeking its rapid and peaceful dissolution before it takes us all down with it.

Midway through the event, a bespectacled lawyer named Steven Howard, describing himself as a liberty activist, took his turn at the podium and shouted, Free Vermont! The response was lackluster, so Howard cried louder: Free Vermont! There was yipping and clapping, and when it died down, Howard asked, How? Answers were not forthcoming, though this was the key question. No compelling mass of Vermonters favored secession; no marchers in Burlington or Montpelier were burning the American flag. In polls taken over the previous five years, no more than 13 percent of registered Vermont voters had expressed support for the idea. In 2010, nine secessionist candidates ran for state office and were rejected by the public. Their best showing was the candidacy of a 19-year-old college student named James Merriam, who received 14 percent of the vote for a seat in the state house of representatives. Until recently, Williams had published and edited a newspaper, Vermont Commons: Voices of Independence, which at its height in 2011 had a print circulation of 12,000 but was now, for lack of funding and advertisers, only a website. His network of critical observers briefly did a brisk business in selling the U.S. Out of Vermont T-shirts. The group even had its own silver independence coin embossed with a portrait of socialist agrarian Scott Nearing, forebear of the back-to-the-land movement in Vermont.

When the proceedings broke for lunch, I asked Morris Berman, who had been invited from his home in Mexico, what he thought of the conferees and their intentions. Theres no chance in hell that a secession is going to happen under current conditions, he said. Im a historian. I look at whats possible. If Vermont seceded, there would be troops in Burlington in two hours. Yet Berman was also hopeful. The Vermonters were reinventing secession. It would not be a mere political revolt, not simply a regional separation, but also, and probably more important, a revolt against the economy of empire, a move toward economic independence. These people here, he told me, are experimenting with a kind of monastic withdrawal that has political implications. Capitalism is eating itself alive, but as the system unravels you have all these little flowering buds appear.

Vermonts first modern-day proponent of secession was a professor of political science at the University of Vermont named Frank Bryan, who in 1987 published a comic account of the states departure from the union, titled Out! The Vermont Secession Book. The book imagined a covenant, signed in secret by Ethan Allen and George Washington, that suggested Vermont had not joined the Union; the Union had, instead, joined Vermont. Now, after two hundred years of bureaucracy, federal mismanagement, and un-Vermont-like actions, Vermont wants out, wrote Bryan and co-author Bill Mares, a state legislator.

In 1991, on the 200th anniversary of Vermonts joining the empire, the legislature gave Bryan funding to travel the countryside with a state supreme court judge to debate the benefits of secession at seven town hall meetings, including one in Montpelier. It was all in good fun, Bryan says. The judge took the pro-Union position. All seven towns voted against remaining in the United States. The reasons for not needing the federal government are pretty clear, Bryan says. The only wild card is defense. But were on the northern border with Canada. Who the hell is gonna bother us?

In Vermont, Bryan says, there is a commonality of people opposed to large distant bureaucracies telling them how to live their lives. Its the decentralist commonality of the libertarian right and what Id call the communitarian left. The right opposes big government, the left opposes big business. Its really about governing on a human scale.

As Bryan notes, Vermont has radical genes, a history rife with alternative thinking. Ethan Allen fought against the British Crown as fiercely as he would fight the Americans. Vermont under Allen produced, in 1777, the first constitution in English to outlaw slavery and allow citizens without property to vote. Nearly two centuries later, Scott Nearing chose Vermont to escape what he called the American Oligarchy, the American Way of Life, the American Century, the American Empire. When he published Living the Good Life in 1954, it became a touchstone for the first generation of the simple-living movement, the hippies and Luddites who in the 1960s flooded into the state to follow Nearings example. Vermont went almost overnight from a right-wing backwater to a leftist mecca that eventually put in office Americas only avowedly socialist senator, Bernie Sanders.

Another college professor, Thomas Naylor, who in 1993 had retired to a village near Burlington after 30 years of teaching economics at Duke University, took up Bryans idea of secession. In 2003, he founded a think tank and citizens network called Second Vermont Republic, its purpose to oppose the tyranny of the United States government, Corporate America, and globalization. Second Vermont Republic would soon have several hundred members. The time has come, Naylor wrote in his 2008 book, Secession, for us peacefully to rebel against the American empire [by] regaining control of our lives from big government, big business, big cities, big schools, and big computer networks.

Naylor, who died at the age of 76 last December, was a native Mississippian, raised in Jackson in a family of what he described as inveterate racists. Revolting against the South of his forefathers, he had founded in 1969, with future Tennessee Attorney General Mike Cody, the L.Q.C. Lamar Society, whose purpose was to promote, as Naylor wrote, a humane civilization in a new South that had shaken off slavery, racism, and segregation but perhaps would keep something of the civility, the courtoisie of the Old South  its slowness, its opposition to hurried industrialism and the quick buck. The Lamar Society found its lineage in the Southern Agrarians of the 1930s, led by poet John Crowe Ransom and novelist Robert Penn Warren. Their co-edited anthology, Ill Take My Stand, featured some of the Souths greatest living writers denouncing the convulsions of a predatory and decadent capitalism. The latter-day societies, Ransom wrote, have been seized  none quite so violently as our American one  with the strange idea that the human destiny is not to secure an honorable peace with nature, but to wage an unrelenting war on nature.

At Duke, Naylor was known less as an economist than as co-creator, with theologian William Willimon, of a popular freshman course, The Search for Meaning. He taught Camus, Kafka, Tolstoy, Faulkner, Erich Fromms To Have or To Be? and Ernest Beckers The Denial of Death, among others. When he arrived in Vermont, he found in the far North what he had loved about the Old South: life lived at a slower, more deliberate, more casual pace. He wrote of the classic red barns, the covered bridges, the picturesque patchwork pattern of small farms, black-and-white Holsteins, tiny villages, little rivers, ridges, hollows, and dirt roads. There were no cities, no big buildings, few shopping malls, no military bases, few big businesses. Vermont, as Naylor saw it, was not only tiny and rural and beautiful. It was humane.

Naylor became the face of Vermont secession. His friends said that with his longish white hair, his bald spot at the crown, his jowls, red cheeks, and horn-rimmed glasses, he resembled Ben Franklin. On cable news and on NPR he carried the banner. During an interview with the Iranian state television network in 2009, wearing his usual forest-green suit-coat and green dress shirt to honor Vermont as the Green Mountain State, Naylor assured the Iranians, who were glad to hear an American inveigh against the Great Satan, that the U.S. was owned and operated by corporate America and Wall Street. He was joined on the program by the head of a Texas secessionist group called the Texas Nationalist Movement; both men agreed that they did not want to be part of the same nation. Naylor had issued similar proclamations while on Fox News with Bill OReilly, who offered him bus fare to Canada. Once, Naylor attempted to hold a meaningful conversation with Glenn Beck, an experience he described as mentally debilitating.

He wanted to lead his movement beyond the confines of the political left and right. What liberals and conservatives have in common, Naylor told me last fall, is that they are both all about bigness and power  big government, big business. They are about owning, possessing, controlling and manipulating money, people, material wealth. Barack Obama, he said, is George W. Bush with a tan and diction and without the smirk. The socialist senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, is a prostitute of empire and a collaborationist, because he took no firm stand against war and defense appropriations. National security was a shared delusion in service of homicide. Left or right, Naylor asked, who wants to be associated with such a shabby creature as the United States?

In 2007, after seeing him on Fox News, a fifth-generation Vermonter named Dennis Steele, the son of working-class parents in the states remote Northeast Kingdom, wrote Naylor that he wanted to join the secessionist cause. Steele had served in the U.S military, was tall and burly and handsome, wore Carhartts, drove a pickup truck, drank maple syrup for breakfast, and hunted deer for his meat. A master at chess, he had founded a successful website, Chessmaniac.com. At Naylors urging, Steele declared his candidacy for governor in the 2010 race. The gods of the empire, went his campaign slogan, cribbed from Ethan Allen, are not the gods of Vermont. The eight other candidates on the secession ticket that year included a car salesman for Subaru, a former ACLU executive who had worked in the New York Legislature, a businessman in solar energy, and an ex-Army lieutenant who had been court-martialed for resisting the Vietnam War. For the first time in over 150 years, Naylor announced at a press conference for the ticket, secession and political independence from the U.S. will be front and center in a statewide New England political campaign.

Steele polled less than 1 percent. Naylor was embittered and exhausted. Ive been at this for close to seven years. Print promotion. Telephone calls. Money. Im tired, he told me. At the secession conference in Montpelier, Rob Williams had introduced Naylor as the reason most of us are in this room. But privately, Naylor wondered whether his approach to taking on the empire had been wrong all along. I may have made a fundamental strategic error in bringing secession north, he said. The paradigm was what I knew growing up in the Deep South, the language of secession, the process of secession that the South championed. Three months later, he was dead.

In the summer of 2010, I rented a room at a tiny Vermont boardinghouse called the Gather-ing Inn, in the town of Hancock at the foothills of the Green Mountains. The proprietor, a mirthful 67-year-old named Kathleen Byrne, had hosted three Vermont independence fund-raisers in recent years. God, cant we just leave already? she said when I asked her about secession. It feels so right. On her property she kept chickens and tended fruit trees and a vegetable garden that fed the household and guests. She had a greenhouse for year-round production. It was a modest kind of independence, she said, meaningful because it was palpable.

A few days later, during the July 4 parade in Montpelier, I followed about two dozen secessionists  Thomas Naylor and Rob Williams leading the pack  as they carried a banner that said 200 Years Is Long Enough and tossed copies of Vermont Commons into the crowd. Behind the secessionists were the Shriners in their go-karts and funny hats, and in front was a tall red, white, and blue layer-cake truck float representing the interests of Community National Bank, whose employees were dressed as Betsy Ross, Lady Liberty, and George Washington. I asked Washington, whose real name is Steve Gurin, bank vice president, what he thought about the gang of seceshers lurking behind him. Gurin laughed mightily, then peppered me with accusatory questions that were by now familiar: Where would revenues come from? How would we survive? Wed be all alone, Gurin said. We cant eat snow!

I had often asked Naylor about these legitimate concerns. He wasnt interested in sweating the details of the divorce. I imagine a free Vermont would be very much like the old Vermont, he said, except that we wouldnt be involved in murdering women and children and supporting the empire. What kind of currency would the new republic use? Oh, wed stick with the dollar, or perhaps go with the euro, or the Canadian loony. What about Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, or the infrastructure currently funded by the federal government  the bridges, the roads, the interstate highways? Free Vermont would figure it out in the fullness of time. The state would get to keep its $$2 billion per capita share of the cost of imperial upkeep and war-making, Naylor said, but Vermont would owe the federal government for the takeover of U.S.owned property. It would owe its share of the national debt. It would face as well questions about the legality of secession. Nowhere in the Constitution is secession prohibited, Naylor said, and the colonist-rebels of the 1770s did not seek permission from the Crown to leave. They just did it.

That afternoon, when the parade was over, I visited Williams at his yak farm outside the town of Waitsfield in the Mad River Valley. The yaks lowed and moaned, and Williams, who is tall and lanky and fast-moving, carried a long wooden staff to herd them along a green hillside that seemed to steam from the summer heat. The independent Vermont, as Williams described it, would not descend into autarky. It would not shut the borders, stop trade. The idea was first to practice more independence where practical. If secession from the U.S. were not possible, its proponents would find other ways to secede from the corporatocracy. The three legs of functional independence are food, fuel, and finance, Williams said. Given peak oil, it might be smart to think of how to lessen dependence on energy-wasteful and socially wasteful systems. More food and more energy produced locally  which is to say independently. More local banks for local credit and capital for local food and energy production.

We herded the yaks down the hill to the evening pasture near the barn, closed up the gates, and ate dinner: yak steaks and produce from his garden. A yak, Williams told me over our meal, consumes less grass per acre per animal than a cow and ends up producing the same amount of nutritional energy. This was independence meat at the end of my fork.

The next day, to stave off the terrible humidity, we went for a swim in the Mad River, climbing a path through pines to a series of ledges where kids were leaping into the emerald water. We got to talking about the concept of the commons, which is central to Williamss notion of economic independence. He motioned at the water, at the sunlight, the air, the tall trees: This is the commons. The idea dates back to Roman civil law, codified in the Institutes of Justinian, which stated that by the law of nature these things are common to all mankind  the air, running water, the sea. Who owned the water we swam in, and together shared with the kids? No one and everyone.

How to measure it as a social good was the question Williams and others in the movement had been asking. Under current law, the value of the commons was not assessed to benefit Vermonters. In a 2008 study, secession advocate Gary Flomenhoft, a research associate professor of ecological economics at the University of Vermont, found that a system of fees, taxes, and other measures imposed on common resources  such as timber, spring water, and minerals  could raise $$1.2 billion in state revenue. Vermont was a resource colony. Its hydroelectric energy plants, producing power for export, were controlled by Canadian shell corporations. Its timber was shipped to China so that residents could buy back shoddy furniture on credit. Most of Vermonts milk was exported, its cheese churned and packaged out of state. Its drinking water, worth hundreds of millions of dollars but handed over to Nestlé and Coca-Cola for a fraction of its worth, was bottled in other states and sold back to Vermonters at twice the price of gasoline.

The first step toward functional independence, then, was to secure the commons for the people of Vermont. The secessionists had helped to draft legislation toward that end, House Bill 385, which would have established a Vermont common-assets trust to set limits on the use of those assets and assess user fees in the form of resource rent. The bill, introduced in 2011, defined the commons in broadest terms: undisturbed habitats, entire ecosystems, biological diversity, waste absorption capacity, nutrient cycling, flood control, pollination, raw materials, fresh water replenishment systems, soil formation systems, and the global atmosphere. The law stipulated that resource rent  presumably as much as $$1.2 billion, a quarter of the states operating budget  would go toward health care, public libraries, education, start-up grants for Vermonters reaching the age of 18, and a citizen dividend similar to the payout Alaskans receive from oil revenues under the Alaska Permanent Fund. Rob Williams described House Bill 385 as revolutionary stuff.

A few months after the Montpelier conference, Williams invited me to attend a strategy meeting of the ten-member board of Vermont Commons, a nonprofit citizens cooperative. The board included a software consultant to Oracle named Robert Wagner; a marketing expert named Gaelan Brown, who was employed with the nonprofit 1% for the Planet; Flomenhoft, the principal author of the Vermont common-assets bill; and a housewife named Juliet Buck, who edited the Vermont Commons website. The subject of the meeting, which took place around a meal of string beans, feta cheese, and wine at Bucks house, was the food-fuel-finance triad.

My people in Addison County are in survival mode, said Wagner, who had run for a seat in the state senate in 2010, lost badly, and was running again in 2012. They know whats wrong with capitalism. Theyre hungry for something to do about it. What does independence mean?

They talked about preparing for a transition society, a Vermont lifeboat. They talked about the portent of climate change in Hurricane Irene, which devastated wide sections of Vermont. They cited lines from a Wendell Berry poem, The Mad Farmer, Flying the Flag of Rough Branch, Secedes from the Union:

From the union of self-gratification and self-Annihilation Secede into the care for one another And for the good gifts of Heaven and Earth.

They talked about food sovereignty. Vermont imports 95 percent of its food, but the secessionists vowed they could invert that figure, producing tens of thousands of new farm and food-distribution jobs and 75 percent of all Vermont food in-state. They offered a litany of reforms: End price pressure on Vermont agriculture by removing the tax incentives and subsidies currently extended to those who speculate on agricultural land. End the federal regulations that burden small-scale raw milk and bread producers and those agrarians who survive by on-farm animal slaughter, processing, and distribution. Invest in regional centers for composting and food processing.

Vermont imports 100 percent of its fossil fuels, including $$700 million a year in propane and heating oil. Gaelan Brown told me that the 250,000 homes in the state could be heated entirely with wood, using 1.2 million cords annually from a renewable supply of 117 million standing cords in Vermonts forests. He calculated that Vermont could produce some 70 percent of its electricity by 2020 through a combination of solar, wind, biomass, and hydropower. The state, Brown said, was already positioned for local energy production: upwards of 30 percent of schoolchildren  more than any other state  attended schools heated with locally sourced wood chips, which had cut fuel costs by 50 percent. Vermont was a leader in renewable energy. It was the only state that had attempted (albeit without success) to wrest control of nuclear power plant relicensing from the federal government.

The secessionists also envision a near-interest-free banking and credit system through a state bank along the lines of the state-owned Bank of North Dakota. A state-run bank, writes Hartwick College research scholar Adrian Kuzminski in Vermont Commons, would provide low-interest capital to citizens [while] breaking the monopoly by private usurious lenders. Legislators floated a bill in 2011 to study the feasibility of a publicly owned bank. The bank bill awaits a committee hearing.

The urtext of the Vermont independence movement is E.F. Schumachers 1973 book Small Is Beautiful: A Study of Economics as if People Mattered. It was the product of Schumachers experience in the 1950s as the chief economist at the British National Coal Board, when he came to the quite reasonable  but at the time unthinkable  conclusion that energy supply, including the coal that Great Britain was so ravenously burning up, could not satisfy unlimited growth. Growth for growths sake, Schumacher concluded, was a suicide pact with planet Earth. We couldnt just keep growing. New paradigms were necessary. He offered a Buddhist Economics, a middle path to develop economies along Buddhist principles, with a new direction to technological development, a direction that shall lead it back to the real needs of man, and that also means: to the actual size of man. He wrote:

Production from local resources for local needs is the most rational way of economic life, while dependence on imports from afar and the consequent need to produce for export to unknown and distant peoples is highly uneconomic. The Buddhist economist would hold that to satisfy human wants from faraway sources rather than from sources nearby signifies failure rather than success.

In Vermont, you can see an inchoate Buddhist economics. It is happening outside the purview of government, beyond the stamp of lawmakers. Its there on Rob Williamss yak farm as he wraps hay bales into his barn for feed and packs yak burgers for sale at his stall at the Waitsfield Farmers Market. Its there in the Vermont Sustainable Exchange, a system of credit among Vermont businesses. It can be found, secessionists say, in the fact that Vermont has the most organic farmland in use per capita of any state, the most widespread locavore food movement in America, the largest sustainability focused association of local businesses, the most microbrews and brewpubs per capita of any state. You can see it in businesses and organizations like Vermont Family Forests, the Vermont Land Trust, and the Biomass Energy Resource Center.

I asked writer and activist Bill McKibben, a neighbor of Robert Wagners in Addison County  they live down the road from each other in the village of Ripton  what he thought of these Schumacherite models in practice, given the resource shocks that Vermont can expect in coming years. Small and distributed will fare better than centralized and oversized, he said. Places with strong communities will fare better than others  the wake of Irene demonstrated powerfully that simple fact.

Yet it seemed to me the secessionists were demanding a shift that went beyond mere re-localizing, and this was the historic challenge they presented. Growth for growths sake is a suicidal delusion, the seceshers were telling us. The solution is relative austerity, which implies a life lived within our means. The American Dream, in other words, would have to die, and Americans would have to do the killing. But this language runs against the grain of the entire Euro-American experiment. It is the language of scarcity, and by their honest speech I wondered if the seceshers would hang themselves.

Still, resource stress is not some oddball fantasy. Historically speaking, Morris Berman told me, its the last 200 years of industrial expansion and uncontrolled fossil-fuel consumption that have been aberrant  sort of like a drunken sailor out on the town. Really, what are the choices at this point? Sustainable society or no society at all.

Toward this end  a sustainable society that is also politically realistic  Kirkpatrick Sale, no small fan of Schumacher, suggests a middle path: Vermont, embracing the doctrine of states rights, might pursue nullification of federal laws that go against its interest as a transition society. States rights would no longer be the exclusive province of the gun nuts and anti-abortionists. Vermont wont secede, Sale says. Its just not happening. Yet, as a decentralist, I do appreciate the move toward independence in as many spheres as you can. Were likely to see more examples of nullification than secession. Look at whats been nullified so far. Real-ID is virtually dead because its been nullified. Marijuana laws in the states have effectively nullified federal prohibition laws. With Obamacare, states are just not setting up their own statewide exchanges.

The more serious Vermont gets about being self-sufficient, the more they might run up against federal regulations. Thats a good way to go  to see if they have power to nullify. Because ultimately when you combine all the powers to nullify, you come up with secession.

On the day before the balloting last November 6, secessionist candidate Robert Wagner went looking for votes in the village of Hancock. When he rang at one of the homes, an old man came to the door and told the candidate that his nephew had been killed in Afghanistan. We get sucked into these wars halfway around the world, when theres no sense to it, said the man. Its not about terrorism. Its all about the oil. These people in D.C. are not thinking about their own people. Maybe wed be better off as our own country.

Wagner, being wary of the word when door-knocking, hadnt mentioned secession. I dont push it, he told me. Ill let them get there themselves.

Wagner described to me what had happened when Hurricane Irene hit Hancock in 2011. The White River rose, swept away entire homes, and disinterred the corpses in nearby cemeteries. A wall of water out of the mountains shredded Route 100, leaving 20-foot canyons, isolating the village. National Guard helicopters were slow to arrive. The Federal Emergency Management Agency was nowhere to be seen. The residents held potluck dinners and planning sessions by candlelight, deputized a leadership, heaved pebbles and gravel in backhoes to begin the repair of the roads  they had no permits to do so  and sent emissaries on foot to outlier settlements, checking on the old and the infirm. Rick Gottesman, who lives with Kathleen Byrne at her inn and who told me he was a quiet secessionist, wrote about Irene in an e-mail: There was palpable pride in the town and its people and a distinct we-aint-waitin-for-no-gubmint attitude. With rivers bursting with water, forests full of firewood, abundant gardens and most of all each other, we could have easily continued for several more weeks and longer.

A week after the ballots were counted, I called Wagner to get the results. He had lost for the second time. But he had snagged 18 percent of his district  more than four times his votes in 2010  and had won the village of Hancock. He vowed to run again in 2014.

Imagine a world where all adults are put into a giant playpen, and guarded by adolescent babysitters. Welcome to the world of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. It is a world where all adults are treated like children. Where dangerous things are labeled, “keep out of reach of children."" It is a world where they are not permitted to exercise responsibility. It is a world where only “experts” can be trusted.

The week of the Virginia Tech (VPI) shooting, Bloomberg assembled a bunch of mayors in Newark N.J. to discuss gun violence and gun control, his new favourite subject. At one point, the normally self-controlled mayor became quietly enraged. Bloomberg said this:

I can’t think of anything dumber than to say, ""Let's give all students on campus a gun. The only thing that’s……It’s…..It’s…In….In…In some sense….uh…ah…I hate to even answer the question, because it’s SICK!!”

First of all notice the assumption, ""…give all students guns,"" as if they were toddlers that some fool parent would entrust with a 12-bore shotgun. I know of no one who proposes that the government or the school give them guns. What I have heard is that these adult students  future engineers, architects, and soldiers (VPI has a corpse of cadets and has a military program)  not be forbidden from having their own guns on campus. I just read a biography of Theodore Roosevelt. He kept several hunting rifles in his room at Harvard. A lot of ex-WW2 veterans in college had guns in their closet. Remember, the first shootings took place in a dorm. If he had been taken out there by a hunter or target shooter, the other students would still be alive.

In Bloomberg’s world people should not be allowed to defend themselves with firearms against armed maniacs. Instead they should be locked in their playpens, with the armed bad boy, until the adults get there to deal with the schoolyard fight. Bloomberg thinks guns should be kept out of the reach of children. Children include any adult who is not in law enforcement, licensed private security, or the military; in other words, those who are not “experts."" Anyone who disagrees with him by practicing ancient common sense, or who thinks he should exercise his own judgment instead of those of others is sick.

This is the same Bloomberg who thinks that business owners should not be allowed to set smoking policies in their establishments, or that restaurant cooks must not be allowed to determine what ingredients go into their cooking. The reason that Bloomberg ALWAYS gives for his decrees is that they save lives. Bloomie wants to be your father.

Here is how Bloomie saves lives. On the exact same day he told rational people they were sick, we had a murder suicide in Queens. A 20-year-old man, with a history of mental disturbances, shot and killed his mother, his mother's invalid boyfriend, and the boyfriend’s hired nurse. He then wounded a nephew, and turned the gun on himself. Before the incident, the mother three times tried to get the cops to do something, but they said she needed a court order. The victim’s sister said, “He was threatening to kill her, and she told the police everything. The police said we can’t do anything about it.""

Had it not been for the VPI story, or the huge N.J. flooding, this story would have made page one, and led the TV and radio news. Bloomberg would have had to make a speech. He would have blamed guns and not the system for three dead people. He might even blame gun dealers in VA. After all, he has set up sting operations to entrap Va. gun dealers. He would have said that we need “to study” the procedures for domestic violence in the courts, and appoint a special deputy mayor to look into this……etc…etc.

Imagine a world where they criminalised owning a fire extinguisher. Now imagine forbidding people to use fire escapes, saying that they are too dangerous, and you can fall; that they are only for “professional use” for firefighters to climb up and save you. Imagine owners of office buildings getting on the P.A. system telling people to stay in their offices during a big fire. This last one I didn't make up. It happened on 9-11 when the first plane hit. All those who blew off the commands are alive. All who did what they were told are dead.

One of the reasons the planes hit the WTC, is because passengers and crewmembers on the flights did what they were told. They were told not to resist — to submit. They banned guns  even from the cockpit and the captain many, of whom are ex-Air force or Navy. They used to be in charge of weapons policy on their planes, as a ship master is on his ship, but that changed in the 1960's. In Bloomberg's world we can trust pilots to fly hundreds of people 30,000 feet over US population centers, but we can’t trust them to safeguard their passengers. I guess they need a background check.

Bloomberg's world, as in most of today’s establishment America, is about spin and taking credit if the policy works. When it doesn’t, as it usually doesn’t, they blame the other party, call for more studies, for more funding, for more of the same laws that force us into the role of the child. They patronise us.

For example. Dr. Christopher Flynn is comfortable in Bloomberg's world. He is the Director of the Counseling Center at VPI. He was on ABC’s Good Morning America. He talked a lot about closure and the grieving process whilst they ran video of students hugging and weeping. He said that the system worked, and that the killer was released from psychiatric treatment because there was no reason to believe he was dangerous. He said it’s impossible to track mental cases in society. He said we need more funding for mental health and blamed Ronald Reagan for cutting it off.

Since Bloomberg's world is all about making a show at saving lives and taking credit, they must make it easier on the paid babysitters guarding the playpen at the expense of the adult toddlers. So we see the lunacy of locking the students in with the killer. This is to make it easier on the cops, who are in business of catching guys for the prosecutor's office or the coroner's office  preferably the latter. They are also not going to commit suicide. So they contain the gunman in a building with unarmed people while they, the cops, prepare by getting into body armour.

Just why is it that these people are called experts and are allowed to have massive firepower, but taxpayers who pay their salary are not? Is it that they are trained in the use of firearms? Well, the NRA and other gun organisations give firearm training. Is it that they undergo extensive “tactical combat” training, that they are trained on which tree to hide behind whilst unarmed people are getting slaughtered by a madman? Is it that the future engineers and physicists of VPI are too stupid to learn how a mechanical device like a pistol or rifle or shotgun operates? And it seems that most of this training is more like military training not the training of a peace officer.

I covered a trial ten years ago in Wilmington N.C. It involved an army Sergeant who went off his nut at Ft. Bragg and shot up a diner in Fayetteville N.C. killing 4 people. One of the patrons ran out the door to his truck to get his rifle. He was met by a cop who had just arrived. He wasn’t arrested. He with his rifle, and the officer crawled to the restaurant door and shot and wounded the killer. No body armour, no histrionics, just two guys who needed to do something RIGHT THEN AND THERE. They knew they had the upper hand and they had the confidence to do it. Bloomberg calls this John Wayne behaviour.

The world is increasingly becoming Bloomberg's world, a world of pathetic whining children. Maybe it's just me, but when I look at the college kids of today, I actually DO see children. Why is it, when I look at old college class pictures I see adult men and women? They look different, even though they are the same age in the pictures. What effect does this patronizing have on kids? Is the Bloombergian world creating perpetual children?

There seem to be more “disaffected” kids who fantasise about murdering people. Why are there more and more kids listening to really violent music, playing fantasy video games about killing people? Why did Mr. Cho make a tape of his infantile ranting and send them to NBC? Why did NBC air them and turn this guy into a hero for other freaks? Is the powerlessness that increasingly forbids people from acting like adults in the Bloombergian world having a disastrous affect on the human psyche? I don't know. Just a thought.

Maybe it's Bloomberg's world that, ""…is sick.""

376138,"The screens were lit up. The show was on. It was curtain time — again. Iraq’s puppet government, flanked by its masters, staged a press conference to announce that they had killed Iraq’s most wanted man du jour. Well, at least most wanted by the occupation forces.

Al-Zarqawi had been raised to mythical proportions by the U.S. occupation authorities who desperately tried to explain away the growing insurgency and their own failure to diffuse it. The quandary for the authorities: Now that al-Zarqawi is gone how will they explain the seamless continuation of the insurgency?

In fact, al-Zarqawi had repulsed and angered the core of the insurgency which saw his tactics as counter-productive and had begun to marginalize him altogether. It is more likely that al-Zarqawi was ""given up"" by the insurgency to rid itself of a public relations and recruiting liability.

In Washington, Donald Rumsfeld surfaced to beat his chest about the al-Zarqawi killing. We were shown video of the air strike, scenes of its aftermath and the placid death mask of al-Zarqawi. Rumsfeld praised the efforts of U.S. forces in tracking down and killing al-Zarqawi whom he classified as a terrorist responsible for the deaths of many innocent Iraqis. There was no mention of the daily slaughter of innocent Iraqis by U.S. forces in Haditha and other parts of Iraq. There was also no mention of Lt. Ehren Watada.

At Fort Lewis, Washington, U.S. Army Lt. Ehren Watada announced that he will refuse to deploy to Iraq. ""The wholesale slaughter and mistreatment of the Iraqi people is not only a terrible moral injustice but a contradiction of the Army’s own law of land warfare. My participation would make me party to war crimes,"" explained Watatda. Even more refreshing was Watada’s observation that his moral and legal duties were to the U.S. Constitution, ""not those who would issue unlawful orders.""

American forces are praised for killing al-Zarqawi and preventing the deaths of even more innocent Iraqis. These are the same American forces which are coy about their own murder of Iraqi civilians. Army Lt. Watatda refuses to kill innocent Iraqis. The defense department says he cannot do that. Lt. Watatda will be prosecuted for refusing to kill innocent Iraqis. Marines at Haditha will be prosecuted for killing innocent Iraqis.

What is wrong with this picture?

270976,"Recently by Anthony Gregory: Why the Left Won't Stop the Wars

""The Davidian cult in Waco was dealt with by armored vehicles,"" remarked Muammar Gaddafi in February, defending his own crackdowns in light of the U.S. government's. April 19 marks eighteen years since the end of the Waco siege and exactly one month since Obama began bombing Libya. Now that the federal government is again shedding blood in the name of humanitarianism, we might reflect on how it obtains legitimacy for its most brazen acts of violence.

Long ago, when governments slaughtered the enemy merely for being different and thus subhuman or for occupying desired territory, such crude rationales satisfied the states' agents and subjects. The modern democratic state, however, employs more sophisticated propaganda when it burns, gasses, shoots, and bombs people including civilians. There is always the excuse of security: the targeted people pose a threat. When this argument seems tenuous, it is well complemented by that most insidious of pretenses: The killing is done for the good of others. It is an act of kindness. The American empire, like the Roman and British before it, inflicts violence to civilize and rescue those in need.

Along these lines even the unparalleled mass death of World War II has been vindicated. Since then most U.S. killing sprees have been directed against Hitler's ghost. Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic were both compared to the Nazi ruler. So were David Koresh and Muammar Gaddafi.

Killing Children to Stop Child Abuse

In the case of Koresh, leader of the Branch Davidian church at Mount Carmel, Texas, the comparisons to Hitler were especially strained. Yet everything about the siege just outside Waco, aside from its humanitarian rationale, seems to have been forgotten. Sure, the religious group was ""stockpiling weapons."" One of them was a legal arms dealer. But why didn't the cops just arrest Koresh while he was hanging out around town? He was an integrated member of the community. Local law enforcement befriended him. The feds were given intimate access to the Davidians' home — even enjoying a stint on their firing range with Koresh — and he welcomed them to inspect the property. The raid commenced on February 28, 1993, not out of anything approaching necessity, but because the ATF wanted to look good for the cameras. ""Operation Showtime"" was the name of the long-planned attack on the Davidian home. Its main purpose: to overcome the bad publicity the agency had suffered over allegations of sexual harrassment and racism.

The feds had constructed a model of the Davidian home where they rehearsed the raid, whose planning began late in the George H.W. Bush administration. But the raid went horribly wrong. The Davidians fought back — apparently in self-defense, which is why when the ATF ran out of bullets, the Davidians ceased fire, and let the agents leave their property in peace.

Soon enough the domestic siege looked militaristic even by modern American standards. It was full-out psychological warfare: The FBI took over and cut off the Davidians' access to the press, to water, to phone calls with relatives or lawyers. They blasted recordings of loud, obnoxious music and the sounds of animals being slaughtered. They shone bright lights upon the home all night. They called it a hostage situation, but people trying to leave the building were typically met with flash-bang grenades thrown at them by the feds.

The siege ended on April 19, 1993, after the FBI spent hours pumping flammable and poisonous CS gas into the area where women and children had gone for safety. Then the Bureau rammed a tank and launched incendiary devices into the home. The Davidians also had Coleman lanterns in nearly every room, which could have easily fallen over in the chaos, and various combustible chemicals stored in the gymnasium. Although Clinton blamed the Davidians for starting the fire, the flames erupted in a manner consistent with the tank's collision into the building. There is no credible evidence that the Davidians were planning a mass suicide by fire, and all the survivors have denied that they were. As researcher Carol Moore put it, ""There is no doubt that Mount Carmel was systematically turned into a fire trap. The only question is, was it done through criminal negligence or with intention to commit mass murder?""

Some survivors convicted in the mockery of a trial have only been out of prison since 2007. Within government, however, no one even had his wrist slapped. Most Americans assume that the government was negligent at worst, and that even this can be forgiven, since the FBI, with military assistance, was attempting a rescue of the innocent. You see, as we've been reminded many times, David Koresh was molesting children.

The first argument behind this accusation concerns Koresh's multiple young wives. Jack Harwell, the Sheriff of McLennan County, explained why we should not excuse the raid on this basis:

To this day, we don’t have a case that we can make against Vernon Howell [David Koresh] or anyone else for child abuse even though the news media here and other people were saying this is what happened. A man from Australia said this is what happened. But we can never get them to give us anything more that just ""we know that's what happened."" You have to have proof to go into court . . . Keep in mind, too, that most of the girls who were involved were at least 14 years old and 14-year-olds get married with parental consent. So if their parents were there and letting things happen in the way of sexual activities and what have you with their 14-year-old kids, you have common law husbands and wives. Uh, I don’t say that I agree with that and that I approve of it. But at the same time, if parents are there and they’re giving parental consent, we have a problem with that in making a case.

There are more serious allegations of abuse, but they too are questionable. On the first day of the 1995 Congressional hearings on Waco, Democrats attempting to whitewash the Clinton administration's conduct brought out Kiri Jewell, who accused Koresh of having molested her when she was ten. No charges of this nature had been pressed against Koresh. However, during the standoff, Jewell, who was not living at Mount Carmel at the time, had appeared on The Phil Donahue Show while her dad pitched their story to the television networks. On the show, she said she expected to be one of Koresh’s wives at age 13. In another public statement, she said that while living with the Davidians she never expected to live past 12.

Despite all this, Jewell's testimony forever colored the mainstream perception of the Branch Davidian Church as a cult of child molestation, which somehow is supposed to make the federal killing less objectionable. The public assumes these allegations are true and no due process is necessary to conclude that the FBI, a heroic if flawed institution, swept in to stop a monster from abusing minors. Presumably, had those children not been gassed, suffocated and burnt to death, they along with the surviving kids would have been exposed to Koresh's torment. This narrative is hardly questioned now and it was hardly questioned then: Not only should we believe all of the government's accusations about Koresh, but those charges somehow mitigate what happened in 1993 when more American civilians died at the hands of the federal government than in any confrontation since Wounded Knee.

Bombing Libyans to Save Libyans

Eighteen years after the flames of Waco, we again see the federal government killing in the name of human rights. Practically no one questions the utilitarian calculus of this altruistic butchery. Most critiques of the Libya war concern strategic prudence, legal issues, or the fiscal price tag.

Should we leave unchallenged the characterization of Obama and NATO as protectors of the innocent? In particular, we hear that Operation Odyssey Dawn prevented Gaddafi from massacring large numbers of civilians in Benghazi. Almost everyone takes it for granted.

To be sure, Gaddafi is a dictator and thug, who indeed killed hundreds of rebels before U.S. cruise missiles hit Tripoli. But would have he slaughtered tens or even hundreds of thousands, as was suggested and claimed, if not for Obama's intervention? Stephen Walt shares his compelling doubts:

Although everyone recognizes that Qaddafi is a brutal ruler, his forces did not conduct deliberate, large-scale massacres in any of the cities he has recaptured, and his violent threats to wreak vengeance on Benghazi were directed at those who continued to resist his rule, not at innocent bystanders. There is no question that Qaddafi is a tyrant with few (if any) redemptive qualities, but the threat of a bloodbath that would ""[stain] the conscience of the world"" (as Obama put it) was slight.

Other scholars have questioned Obama's propaganda. University of Texas associate professor Alan Kuperman notes that Gaddafi ""did not massacre civilians in any of the other big cities he captured — Zawiya, Misrata, Ajdabiya — which together have a population equal to Benghazi."" Human Rights Watch has recently released casualty figures on Misrata that bolster his point. Kuperman writes:

Misurata's population is roughly 400,000. In nearly two months of war, only 257 people — including combatants — have died there. Of the 949 wounded, only 22 — less than 3 percent — are women. If Khadafy were indiscriminately targeting civilians, women would comprise about half the casualties. . .

Nor did Khadafy ever threaten civilian massacre in Benghazi, as Obama alleged. The ""no mercy"" warning, of March 17, targeted rebels only, as reported by The New York Times, which noted that Libya's leader promised amnesty for those ""who throw their weapons away."" Khadafy even offered the rebels an escape route and open border to Egypt, to avoid a fight ""to the bitter end.""

Paul Miller, who served on Bush and Obama's National Security Councils, intones that far from a genocidal clash, we are looking at a ""Libyan civil war. . . between a tyrant and his cronies on one side, and a collection of tribes, movements, and ideologists (including Islamists) on the other."" (Incidentally, these opponents of Gadhafi's regime, like practically all other insurgent allies of the CIA, are far from the angelic freedom fighters that the U.S. implies. Their leader outright admits connections between his group and al-Qaeda, which has offered his rebels aid. The U.S. went to war with Iraq boasting of Saddam's fictitious ties to al-Qaeda, a connection that was ""proven"" on the tortured testimony of Libyan al-Qaeda operative Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi. But unlike Saddam, America's allies in the struggle against Gaddafi are probably tied to these Islamist killers.)

In any event, let us concede for argument's sake that Gaddafi is precisely as diabolical as is claimed, and the dictator indeed wishes to wipe out as many innocents as possible just for the sake of it. Or let's assume this was a reasonable inference when the NATO bombing began. Time and again we have been reminded that Benghazi is home to over half a million people. But does a large population mean they'd all be vulnerable? Let us recall that Gaddafi is not Harry Truman. He has no nukes. As Seumas Milne put it: ""Given that [Gaddafi's] ramshackle forces were unable to fully retake towns like Misurata or even Ajdabiya when the rebels were on the back foot, the idea that they would have been able to overrun an armed and hostile city of 700,000 people any time soon seems far-fetched."" Whereas the citizens of Benghazi have arms, like the civilians at Waco, they far outnumber Gaddafi's forces, unlike the Branch Davidians against the FBI. Even if he wished to commit a Waco-like massacre of a whole city, Gaddafi had more effective limits on his killing than does the U.S. government.

The notion that U.S. bombs stopped Gaddafi's murder of many thousands is more than dubious, and it was at the time the bombings began. Even if we believed the questionable claims about his intention to commit such an act, it is not clear how he was supposed to have succeeded. Yet simply by starting a war and saying it was to protect the innocent, Obama shifted public support of intervention against Libya from about 25% to about 60%.

Putting aside the suspicious claims of Gaddafi's impending civilian massacre, we might wonder how many civilians Obama and company have actually killed in Libya. The NATO governments shrug off any reports of such casualties or deny them outright. Like its predecessor the Obama administration doesn't do body counts. What's more, the U.S. intervention most likely ""magnifies the threat to civilians in Libya, and beyond,"" Kuperman argues, citing the Balkans in the 1990s and showing that foreign bombs often exacerbate ethnic cleansing and civilian massacres.

Indeed, U.S. involvement appears to have prolonged the bloodshed in Libya. Although Obama denied the goal was regime change, he now says Gaddafi must step down to end the war. Gaddafi has offered a ceasefire to the rebels, who rejected it, probably knowing that the U.S. will support them so long as they resist until the regime is toppled.

People can freely argue that U.S. intervention has preempted Gaddafi's impending genocide, but the burden should be on them to prove it, and as with Kosovo, they have not done so. To the contrary, Gaddafi has seemingly focused his violence on the rebels, whereas the U.S. central state is not always so discriminating. At Waco, dozens of children were snuffed out. In Iraq and Afghanistan, hundreds of thousands of innocents have died in wars based on lies. In Obama's drone attacks in Pakistan, ten civilians die for every ""militant"" killed, even according to moderate estimates by very mainstream sources. That these ""militants"" are a threat to the United States government is never demonstrated, but let's assume they are. The ratio of unarmed, innocent bystanders to belligerents killed by the United States is higher than that of which Gaddafi is guilty in Misurata.

Why do people believe the U.S. government's propaganda about Libya when every single major military intervention it has conducted has exacerbated the problems on the ground or at least added to the death toll directly? Why is the mere assertion that a massacre is being averted a license for the U.S. to drop at least hundreds of bombs?

18 Years of Murderous Salvation

The American belief in benevolent mass murder is not a partisan disposition. Most liberals and conservatives alike take it for granted that, while the federal government's armed agents sometimes act recklessly or carry out mistaken orders, their acts should never be seen as murder. The assumption is nearly universal that Obama, Bush and Clinton, whatever their partisan opponents might think, are not mass murderers in the mold of Gaddafi, or cult leaders along the lines of Koresh, when in fact our presidents are far worse than either of these men in terms of cultish power as well as sheer body count. All three of these chief executives, and many before them, have commanded the loyalty of far more subordinates willing to die on their orders than Koresh ever could, and have extinguished more innocent lives than Gaddafi ever did.

Waco and Libya are only the first and latest examples of U.S. humanitarian atrocities in the post-Cold War era. In both situations, we see the U.S. government leaving behind rubble and death, and the chattering classes agreeing that Washington has the innocents' best interests at heart, even as it imposes sanctions on civilians or cuts them off from water, disregarding the very humanity of the victims of Uncle Sam's explosions. When D.C. kills it is never seen as when others, whether private American citizens or foreign despots, do it.

When a private religious separatist allegedly molests children, it is an excuse for gassing children to death. But when the federal government molests children it is merely airport security. When a foreign dictator is allegedly about to kill tens of thousands of innocents, it is an excuse for another non-defensive U.S. presidential war. But when the U.S. government kills millions though sanctions, chemical warfare, conventional bombings and depleted uranium, it is simply the mainstream foreign policy consensus at work.

It is particularly hard to cut through these double standards when left-liberal presidents kill, as both sides of the spectrum benefit from pretending that these politicians are less trigger-happy than the conservatives. Yet Clinton and Obama have both revealed themselves to be as bloodthirsty as the Bushes before them.

Whether using the military to police the world or militarizing the police here at home, the federal government's favorite activity appears to be killing. Thanks to the domestic precedent of Waco and the foreign-policy traditions of the last few presidents, there are now essentially no limits on the power of Washington to kill men, women and children, at home and abroad, and get away with it in the court of public opinion. Nothing gives the executive branch the free hand to snuff out human life like the promise of humanitarian salvation.

469097,"Recently by Gary North: The Foundational Economic Myth of OurEra: ‘Government Cured the GreatDepression’

On August 15, 1971, a Sunday, President Nixon unilaterally suspended the last traces of the gold standard. He “closed the gold window” on his own authority. From that time on, no government or central bank has been able to exchange dollars for Treasury gold at a fixed price. Nixon broke the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944. He broke the nation’s word. He cheated. That was his way. Ever since that day, American monetary policy has been Nixonomics.

Eight months earlier, he had announced his conversion to Keynesianism. This passage is from the amazingly good documentary on PBS, “Commanding Heights.” For one thing, whatever the effects of the Vietnam War on the national consensus in the 1960s, confidence had risen in the ability of government to manage the economy and to reach out to solve big social problems through such programs as the War on Poverty. Nixon shared in these beliefs, at least in part. “Now I am a Keynesian,” he declared in January 1971  leaving his aides to draft replies to the angry letters that flowed into the White House from conservative supporters. He introduced a Keynesian “full employment” budget, which provided for deficit spending to reduce unemployment.

If you think I am trying to tar and feather critics of the gold standard and defenders of Keynesian economics by connecting their ideas to a pragmatic, lying politician, then you’re brighter than your brother-in-law thinks.

THE NEW YORK TIMES

It should come as no surprise that the premier mouthpiece of American Establishment official opinion, The New York Times, is hostile to the traditional gold coin standard or any state-guaranteed version of the gold standard.

The New York Times used to be called “the gold standard of journalism.” But it was always a fiat standard. And like the fiat United States dollar, its value keeps sinking.

The gold coin standard places limits on a central bank’s ability to create money out of nothing, meaning counterfeiting. This is why its critics hate it.

At the center of almost every national economy today is a central bank that has been granted the government-sanctioned authority to intervene in the financial sector on behalf of large multinational banks. In the city of over-leveraged multinational banks, the New York Times wants no limits placed on the ability of the Federal Reserve System to bail out over-leveraged multinational banks.

The Times is well aware of the fact that Ron Paul is most famous for his position, which is also his book’s title, to end the FED. This position was considered crackpot, even within conservative political circles, prior to Paul’s run for the Republican Party’s nomination for President in late 2007. His was a well-timed candidacy. The economy went into a recession in December of 2007.

His stand against the FED spread rapidly in late 2008, after the FED and the U.S. government bailed out the biggest banks. The anti-FED genie is out of the bottle. Never before in America’s post-1913 history has there been this much public opposition to the FED.

The Times can do nothing about this, other than to publish an occasional obligatory article that announces: “You know where we stand.” Of course we know. We also know that the fiscally besieged Times is going bankrupt.

We know that its influence is fading, along with all print media. We know that there will not be enough paying online subscribers to offset the declining revenues from advertising, which the Times cannot command these days in the face of its declining readership.

So, for old Times sake, I offer my critique of its recent piece, “Be Careful Wishing for the Fed’s End.” That warning makes about as much sense to me as this one: “Be Careful Wishing for the Times’ End.” The author is the company’s in-house financial columnist, Roger Lowenstein.

A CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FED

Lowenstein leads off with one of the most heart-warming paragraphs of my intellectual life. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, faces a crisis of confidence. He is excoriated on the right for debasing the currency, and blasted on the left for failing to stimulate more than he has. It has gotten so bad that last week Mr. Bernanke, who prefers to discuss monetary policy with erudite professors like himself, submitted to the indignity of a news conference. Among the uninvited was Representative Ron Paul, who is flirting with a presidential run, and who, if he took office in 2013, would like nothing more than to celebrate the Fed’s centennial by … abolishing it.

Think about this paragraph. Never before in the FED’s history has any chairman faced this kind of opposition. And that got me to thinking: What if there were no Fed? Don’t laugh; it has happened before. The United States had a primitive central bank, conceived by Alexander Hamilton, but President James Madison let its charter lapse in 1811.

Madison did nothing of the kind. By the terms of its incorporation, it automatically lapsed, and no President had any authority to keep it from lapsing.

Lowenstein does not mention that, during the long fight over the re-chartering of the Bank, Albert Gallatin, the Secretary of the Treasury, had favored the Bank’s re-chartering from 1809 to 1811. At no time did Madison fire him or suggest that he did not speak for Madison on this issue. Madison had two years to do so; Gallatin repeatedly lobbied Congress for the renewed charter. In 1811, the vote to re-charter failed by one vote in the House. In the Senate, the vote was tied; Vice President Clinton voted against it. Therefore, Madison did not let the First Bank’s charter lapse. Congress did, just barely. If Madison had publicly opposed the re-chartering, the votes would not have been close. But he kept silent. He let Gallatin speak for him. In 1816, Madison favored the creation of the Second Bank of the U.S. He signed it into law.

Having misled his readers regarding the First Bank of the United States, Lowenstein goes on to mislead them about the second Bank, i.e., Madison’s Bank. A second such bank became the target of President Andrew Jackson, who viewed it as a “hydra” and a “curse” upon the nation. Jackson sought to decertify the bank and, in 1836, succeeded. Never mind that the following year, the United States was plunged into a serious financial panic. The curse had been lifted, not to reappear for nearly a century.

Never mind? Here is what he wants his readers not to mind. The president of the Bank, Nicholas Biddle, filed for re-chartering in 1831, five years early. The election of 1832 was fought mainly over the re-chartering of the Bank. Jackson vetoed the bill to re-charter. Congress failed to override the veto. Jackson’s Party had a smashing victory in November. The government ceased depositing funds in the Second Bank. Biddle’s bank began calling in loans, to pressure Jackson to comply. This action failed. The panic of 1837 was the result of an expansion of fractional reserve banking at the state level, 1833-36, over which the U.S. government had no constitutional control.

If the U.S. government had simply refused to deposit tax receipts in the banks, calling in specie and holding it as “excess reserves,” to use the nomenclature of today’s Federal Reserve System, there would have been no boom or bust, 1833-37. This idea was well known. It was called the independent Treasury system.

There was an inflow of silver, 1833-37, because of the inflationary policies of Santa Anna’s government. It was the result of Gresham’s law: a fixed exchange rate on silver. This inflow had nothing to do with Jackson or the Second Bank. The monetary base grew. Reserve requirements were not raised by state banks, including the Bank of the United States, still run by Biddle. The problem was fractional reserve commercial banking, as always: the state-granted license to counterfeit money.

IF THERE WERE NO FEDERAL RESERVE

The Establishment can no more conceive of money without a central bank than it could conceive of television programming standards without the Federal Communications Commission in 1970 or airline ticket pricing without the Civil Aeronautics Board in 1977.

Established in 1913, the Fed was to be a banker to the nation’s banks, controlling the money supply and, thus, the value of the currency. Without a Fed, someone else would have to handle these (and other) tasks of central banking.

Under the FED, there was monetary inflation in the World War I era, then the recession of 1920-21, and then the monetary inflation and bust of 1926-30, followed by the Great Depression. Stability? There was none. “Money,” observes the Fed historian Allan H. Meltzer, “does not take care of itself.” But who else could regulate the value of money? And regulate its value in relation to what?

Why doesn’t money “take care of itself”? Because governments want to control it. Contract law serves the other markets. Why not money? Why should money be under the control of a system of 12 privately owned banks that are under a government board? In its founding days, the United States defined the dollar by an explicit weight of gold or silver.

No, it didn’t. The dollar was always a silver standard. Then a price control with gold was set by the government, which led to Gresham’s law. Sometimes gold would be in short supply, sometimes silver. That is what price controls produce: gluts and shortages. During the first half of the 19th century, state-chartered banks issued notes, preferably backed by metal, that circulated much as dollar bills do today. But since these banks were private, and differed widely in their standards, their notes were accorded different values. In effect, the country had lots of “monies.”

Exchange rates set the value of these notes, just as the free market does in the currency markets today. With computerization in our day, this is no problem. The government can set what currency it requires for tax payments. Gold would be a good choice. The government does not need to set currency ratios. It does not need to monopolize money. But politicians want to. The United States moved to normalize the situation during the Civil War. It restricted the issuance of notes to more uniform, federally chartered banks, which were required to hold Treasury bonds (as well as gold) in reserve.

The government did this to gain more control over the money supply. It had suspended payment in gold in late 1861  a violation of contract. Then it created “greenbacks”  unbacked paper money  in a wave of price inflation. The South did the same, only much worse. It was theft: first the suspension of specie payments, then from the people through inflation. Should the Fed be interred, this abbreviated history provides some clues about alternatives. One solution would be for private banks to issue money  perhaps bearing the likeness of Jamie Dimon and the seal of his bank, JPMorgan Chase. Alternatively, the Treasury could do it.

Private agencies of all kinds could issue money. The market would decide which to use. Money tied to gold or silver would enjoy a great advantage. Banks do this now, but without being tied to gold. Their digits are money.

If the government ever does this, then hyperinflation is a sure thing. This would be greenback economics, which is always political and inflationary in modern times. On greenback economics, click here.

A GOLD STANDARD

As long as contracts are not violated, private money would work far better than the Federal Reserve’s legalized counterfeiting does. Any firm could issue an IOU for gold or silver or platinum coins of a specific weight and fineness. Just be sure it has the metals in reserve. But what will the money represent? Gold is the first obvious answer. James Grant, the newsletter writer, author and gold bug par excellence, asserts that gold money is superior to the “fiat” money of the Fed. By fiat, he means that it has value only because the Fed says it does. (Representative Paul, less diplomatically, refers to Federal Reserve notes as “counterfeits” and to the Fed as a price fixer.)

Grant is correct. Paul is correct. Fiat money is counterfeit money. Let the banks issue warehouse receipts 100% backed by gold. Contract law will take over. There will be a market for gold coins.

Let us interject that in any monetary system, some authority must fix either the price of money or the supply. McDonald’s can either set the price of a hamburger and let the market consume the quantity it will  or, it can insist on selling a specified quantity, in which case consumer demand will determine the price.

I will not let “us” interject anything of the kind. There is no logic to it. Gold, silver, and platinum are limited by mining costs, but there is no fixed money supply. There never has been in man’s history. The statement is conceptually ludicrous and historically ludicrous. No authority need fix either the supply or the price of anything. The Fed has a similar choice with money. The Bernanke Fed, which is trying to stimulate the economy, regulates the price of money  the interest rate  presently 0.0 percent. Paul Volcker, who assumed command of the Fed in 1979, when inflation was rampant, chose the opposite tactic. Mr. Volcker provided a specific (and, dare I say, miserly) quantity of liquidity, letting interest rates go where the market directed  ultimately 20 percent. There is an element of arbitrary choice either way.

The element of arbitrary choice is the heart of the problem: it will eventually be misused. Central banking’s cheerleaders want us to believe that wise, salaried bureaucrats should control the monetary base. There is a problem here: these bureaucrats then must let commercial bankers, speculators, and governments decide what the money is worth. They cannot determine this on their own authority. The gold standard, in effect, replaces the Fed chief with the collective wisdom (or luck) of the mining industry. Rather than entrust the money supply to a guru or a professor, money is limited by the quantity of bullion.

He’s got it! The private property rights system restricts the money supply, so that neither politicians nor central bank committees are in charge of our money. We can trust mining costs with greater confidence than politicians with badges and guns and a printing press. The law in the early 20th century stipulated that dollars be backed 40 percent in gold. This fixed the dollar in relation to metal but not in relation to things, like shoes or yarn, that dollars could buy. This was because the quantity of bullion that banks had in reserve, relative to the size of the economy, fluctuated. As a historian noted, it was as if “the yardstick of value was 36 inches long in 1879 … 46 inches in 1896, 13 and a half inches in 1920.”

Whoever that unnamed historian was, he was an economic ignoramus. Money is not a measure. It is a social institution based on contract. The government wants to get control over it, so that it can create fiat money and thereby impose an inflation tax rather than tax voters directly.

The gold standard  which John Maynard Keynes termed a “barbarous relic”  led to ruinous deflations.

There have never been any ruinous deflations based on a contracting supply of gold. Gold’s supply constantly increases, though slowly. There were many deflations based on fractional reserve banking  fiat money allowed to commercial bankers by the state  when the over-leveraged (over-counterfeited) banks got hit by bank runs. When gold reserves contracted, so did the money supply. David Moss, a Harvard Business School professor, asserts that the United States experienced more banking panics in the years without a central bank than any other industrial nation, often when people feared for the quality of paper; specifically, it experienced them in 1837, 1839, 1857, 1873 and 1907.

States authorize commercial bank counterfeiting. The Constitution does not authorize the U.S. government to intervene to stop this practice. That is what federalism is all about. That is what the Tenth Amendment used to be about, before it was gutted by the Supreme Court.

THE CREATURE FROM JEKYLL ISLAND

The Establishment occasionally admits that the November 1910 meeting on Jekyll Island was a quiet gathering. But it was not a conspiracy. Not at all. The difference is this. . . There must be a difference. . . Anyway, it was all for the public’s good. The Fed was conceived to alleviate such crises; that is, to be “the lender of last resort.” This function was fulfilled, ad hoc, by the financier J. P. Morgan in the panic of 1907. But Morgan was old, destined to die the year the Fed was created; some institution was needed. Hostility toward central banks, an American tradition, was such that in 1910, lawmakers and bankers convened at Jekyll Island, Ga.  under the ruse of going duck hunting  to sketch a blueprint.

The FED was conceived to bail out the big New York banks. It was justified as a tool to alleviate crises. And, yes, it was a conspiracy consummated on Jekyll Island by a group of bankers and Senator Nelson Aldrich, John D. Rockefeller, Jr.’s father-in-law. Part of the aim of the new central bank was a more flexible money supply  for instance, to lend to farmers in the winter. Another was to lend into the teeth of a panic  though only to solvent institutions and on sound collateral. The insurance giant American International Group  a controversial bailout recipient in 2008  would not have qualified.

AIG surely qualified in 2008. That is what “flexibility” is for: to bail out insiders.

Farmers in the winter. Right! As if the FED cared a whit about farmers, back then or now. Did the FED save farms in the 1920s? No. Did it save farm area banks, 1930-33? No. In any case, prices for grain adjust in winter. That is what pricing is for. That is also why interest rates change. Conditions change. You don’t need counterfeiting to smooth out supply and demand based on seasons. In its early days, the Fed maintained the gold standard  forcing it to maintain tight money even in 1931, in the midst of the Great Depression. Economists today regard this as a mistake.

This is Milton Friedman’s misleading intellectual legacy. The FED did not tighten money, 1930-31. See the chart provided by a vice president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. The monetary base was flat.

Money shrank because 9,000 banks went under. That ceased in 1934, when the FDIC was set up. The FED had no authority or ability to save 9,000 banks. The circumstances are relevant to those who envision a Fed-less future. England had departed from the gold standard; worried that the United States would follow suit, people demanded to trade dollars for gold. Professor Meltzer deduces that the gold standard doesn’t work for one country alone; the bad paper money corrupts the good.

This is the ill-informed person’s view of Gresham’s law: that the free market rewards bad money. It doesn’t. When there are government-imposed fixed exchange rates  price controls on money  the artificially overvalued money drives out the artificially undervalued money. In other words, price controls create gluts and shortages. Every economist knows this. Any economist who promotes Gresham’s law without explaining this price control factor is trying to put the shuck on the rubes. Lowenstein is one of the rubes who got shucked.

AN ALTERNATIVE TO GOLD

Here is where Lowenstein lets his imagination soar. An alternative to gold, and to the Fed, was suggested by Mr. Bernanke’s hero, Milton Friedman: let a computer govern the money supply. John Taylor, a former Treasury official, has derived a formula, the Taylor Rule, which Fed policy often agrees with. Adopting the formula in a mechanical way would trim the deficit a bit, since the Fed could dismiss every one of its 200 economists. The problem with a formula (also its virtue) is its lack of flexibility. Alan S. Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman, notes that strict adherence to the Taylor Rule during the recent crisis would have mandated an interest rate of negative 5 percent. (That is, the economy was so weak, and people so unwilling to borrow money, the computer would have paid people 5 percent a year to accept it.) This being impractical, Mr. Bernanke was moved to improvise a remedy other than negative rates.

This is academic self-puffery. There is no Taylor rule at the FED. That is my point and Ron Paul’s point. There are no rules. You know: “flexibility,” as Lowenstein calls it. There is only ad-hockery, such as: (1) double the monetary base, (2) swap T-bills at face value for toxic assets held by large New York banks, and (3) lend billions to large foreign banks. If the computer is out and the Fed shuttered, Professor Meltzer suggests that the dollar be backed by euros, pounds and yen (and, eventually, the renminbi). This new money would require that each of the financial powers commits to a targeted rate of inflation  say, 2 percent a year. People who didn’t trust the dollar to maintain its value could trade them for euros. Now there’s an idea that would delight the Tea Party  American money backed by France.

Professor Meltzer can say anything he wants. Nobody has to believe him. I surely don’t.

The dollar is not backed by anything, and has not been ever since August 15, 1971, when Nixon without authorization suspended payments in gold to foreign central banks. Nixon was a petty tyrant, but here the Congress and business cheered. He imposed price and wage controls. More cheering. Ben Bernanke presides over Nixonomics, as have all subsequent chairmen of the Board of Governors of the FED. But no one in the Establishment wants to call the system what it really is: Nixonomics. Actually, this system is not terribly different from today’s. We have, indeed, fiat money, convertible into foreign exchange and regulated, not always successfully, with the intent of maintaining (or not too quickly depreciating) the dollar’s purchasing power. And if money is a unit of value, it is hard to conceive of a yardstick better than purchasing power.

I see. A yardstick. This “yardstick” has shrunk by over 95% since 1914, the year the FED opened for business. You can check this with the inflation calculator of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But the Fed, thanks to an act of Congress in 1978, and perhaps to America’s suspicious anti-central banking culture, has a dual mission  protecting the value of the dollar and promoting long-term growth and employment. In this, it differs (at least in degree) from Europe’s and other central banks. In many ways, this mission creep  the Fed’s expanded power and role in the economy  lies at the root of the animus that Americans feel for it.

This is not a dual mission. It is a dual public relations statement. Congress did not specify any numbers. The FED gets to make them up as it goes along . . . and does. Banking purists would like, if not to abolish the institution, to return it to the job envisaged on Jekyll Island. They are, in a sense, the financial equivalent to strict constitutionalists. Nostalgia has its place, but so does pragmatism. Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues may be flawed, but democracy trusts in the power to elect, appoint and, if need be, remove. It is fine to lament their alleged excesses  for instance, the Fed’s swollen balance sheet in the name of stimulation, or “quantitative easing.” It is another to imagine that regulating the money could be as simple as it was in 1913, or that a formula, or a barbarous relic, could do the job.

CONCLUSION

In his view, defenders of the gold coin standard are quaint relics of the past, just as gold is. He writes: “They are, in a sense, the financial equivalent to strict constitutionalists. Nostalgia has its place, but so does pragmatism.” So, adhering to the Constitution is nostalgia. So is the idea of a world without the creature from Jekyll Island.

What Lowenstein wants is pragmatism. You know: flexibility.

This is what every central banker always wants. Also, every dictator.

Richard Nixon surely wanted it.

It is what Ron Paul does not want. Neither do I.

22794,"In many ways, George Bush and Tony Blair’s war on Iraq feels like yesterday. Colin Powell’s jewel case of lies before the UN, Tony Blair’s Parliamentary debate during which he listened neither to reason nor to warnings, the ‘shock, and awe’ of bombs being dropped on Iraq’s great cities, Bush’s ‘mission accomplished’ farce and the war which continued for years after, one which still is ongoing; all of it feels surreally fresh.

Almost 14 years later, the lessons of Iraq are well known: illegally invade a sovereign country which threatens no one and expect hell, instability, blood, torture and terror as a consequence. The lessons were not remembered by Hillary Clinton who along with David Cameron and Nicholas Sarkozy dragged a hesitant Barack Obama into a war in Libya, a war whose outcome is even more disastrous than the war in Iraq.

The wider public, however, have learned the lessons. Both in Europe and in America, the general public are fed up of war. Some are too naïve or too arrogant to openly associate themselves with those of us who warned of the dangers a war on Iraq would unleash. But they too have learned the lessons. It is one of the reasons Donald Trump continually states his opposition to the war in Iraq which then Senator Hillary Clinton voted for.

This is why the mainstream media are in fits of hysterics trying to do the bidding of their war monger masters in attempting to convince the public to support doing to Assad what was illegally done to Saddam and Gaddafi.Since 2003 not only have the lessons of Iraq been instructive to erstwhile war supporters in the west, the media landscape has also changed significantly. Television channels like RT did not exist in 2003 but now they present rational claims from not just the west but around the world, against the calls for war.

Why are the most advertised Gold and Silver coins NOT the best way to invest?

In hindsight, the internet had not fully blossomed by 2003, much though it felt that it had done at the time. Today many news and analysis websites put the failing newspapers to shame. They are an instantaneous source of valuable information.

Wikileaks did not exist in 2003, but since its inception in 2006, it has blown the lid on the sadistic things governments do, how they do them and the sinister motives behind them. One cannot dismiss oppositional viewpoints as conspiratorial when one reads the documents which speak the truth in black and white.

But most importantly yet surprisingly least talked about, is the fact that Syrians have the internet, they have cameras, they have websites and they are using them. In 2003, the western media attempted to demonize the proud and highly educated Iraqi people either as gangs of Saddamite stooges or as opposed unpatriotic invalids without minds. Because of the poor education system in countries like America, many believed this without ‘questioning more’.

Today, though, no matter what the mainstream media say, the voices of the Syrian people cannot be drowned out.

Indeed, The Duran frequently publishes pieces by Afra’a Dagher, an actual Syrian as opposed to Samantha Power who pretends to speak for Syrians against their wishes. There are videos on youtube, statements in English from Syrian journalists, experts, and the legitimate government. This are being read and circulated on social media. The mainstream media monopoly is over.

It is often viewed as a platitude to say that ideas and the dissemination of ideas can change the world. But the aggregate effect of opposition media like RT, Wikileaks, online expert opinion and analysis and the power of social media may well have saved Syria from the fate of Yugoslavia, Iraq, and Libya.",lewrockwell.com,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

""The budget should be balanced. Public debt should be reduced. The arrogance of officialdom should be tempered, and assistance to foreign lands should be curtailed, lest Rome become bankrupt.""

~ Marcus Tullius Cicero (106—43 B.C.)

In a recent conversation among friends concerning the present crop of presidential candidates, a close friend emphatically stated that if Ron Paul wasn’t the Republican candidate then, ""I will vote for the worst possible candidate with the hope he/she will speed up the implosion of this unconstitutional government…""

While I don’t ascribe to this voting philosophy I do understand his feelings and empathize with his frustration.

It wasn’t until later that I realized that the Roman senator Marcus Tullius Cicero must have had much the same feeling when he chose to support the frail, sickly, orator Gaius Octavius (when no else in the senate would) over Marcus Antonius (Marc Antony) after Julius Caesar’s death in 44 BC.

Cicero was a stanch Republican and he had supported the ideals of the Roman republic even against Julius Caesar. He believed in “Senatus populusque Romanus,” the senate and the Roman people as the core of Roman Republic, and that meant he believed in the Republic. Most of Cicero’s life had been lived under the Roman republic and he had prospered because of it.

It was his defense of the senate in 63 BC, against a potential violent uprising, which brought him acclaim from a powerful leader of the senate — Marcus Cato — who proclaimed Cicero ""pater patriae"" (father of his country). Cicero’s stinging condemnation of empire attests to his sentiments.

Cicero wrote concerning liberty: ""Only in states in which the power of the people is supreme has liberty any abode."" While against the tyranny of the state he said: ""Peace is liberty in tranquility. Servitude is the worst of all evils, to be resisted not only by war, but even by death.""

So why would Cicero choose to support Julius Caesar’s heir; Octavian? If Cicero hadn’t been murdered by agents of Marcus Antonius in 43 BC would he have continued his support after Julius Caesar’s deification in 42 BC; at which time Octavian insisted he was no longer to be addressed as ""Octavian"" but now was to be called ""Caesar"" and saw his true status as divi filius — ""son of the deified""?

I believe he would have. Cicero’s choices boiled down to the devil he knew (Marcus Antonius) versus the devil he hoped he could use to destroy the empire (Octavian). If anything, Cicero wished to restore the prosperity that the Romans had enjoyed during the period of the Roman republic; plus he was fully aware of Rome’s history and Rome’s current situation.

The Roman republic had been established after the abolition of monarchy in 510 BC and Rome had come to be a dominating power under the res publica meaning ""the constitution of the state.""

It is to this period of Roman history Virgil addresses in his Aeneid: ""Others will hammer out bronzes so gracefully that you would think that their statues breathed, and bring out the living features of a face from stone. They will plead cases better; better trace out the wanderings of the heavens with a compass and name the rising stars. But you, Roman, remember, these are your skills: to govern the peoples with power and to establish the habit of peace; to be sparing of the vanquished and to crush the arrogant in war.""

You may find Virgil’s statement overly sentimental, and strangely reminiscent of the current neocon attitude towards U.S. military adventures, starting with the Spanish American war, and particularly in the last eight years. However, the fact remains that Rome’s rise to power was due to its military prowess, but what is forgotten is that Rome had help.

It was toward the middle of the third century BC that the Hellenistic world began its collapse and there began to arise a sharp contrast between the economies of Egypt and Greece with that of the free Romans living under an enforced constitution.

In both Egypt and Greece the economies were becoming more and more nationalized to the point of being socialistic. The results were that the peoples of Greece and Egypt were strictly controlled; deprived of the freedom to pursue personal profit in either production or trade; burdened with devastating progressive taxes, and forced to work in state-controlled collectives where they had little more status than an American 18th-century southern plantation slave.

The results of these socialist policies were the same on these ancient cultures as they are on modern societies. Hans-Hermann Hoppe explains:

""…(E)veryone’s inclination toward laziness and negligence is systematically encouraged. Hence, an inferior quality and/or quantity of goods will be produced and permanent capital consumption will ensue."" Democracy: The God That Failed, p. 123

These nationalistic policies also resulted in weak, ineffective leadership throughout the Mediterranean and in particular in Egypt and Greece, producing the consequences of constant warfare; uncontrolled piracy, the Mediterranean Sea almost closed to trade, followed by economic stagflation.

The Roman armies marched into the weakened Mediterranean states, rarely or seriously opposed, and in much in the same manner as the U.S. military became the ""policemen of the world"" after the collapse of the Soviet Union on December 31, 1991. The Romans were accordingly positioned so that by the first century BC Rome could claim to be the undisputed master of the Mediterranean.

Rome’s victories should have insured peace but peace was all but snuffed out by civil wars.

Continual wars were wearing on the Romans who found that after 146 BC there were no more conquests that supplied unlimited riches. Wars in Spain, Gaul, along with the slave revolts at home were not profitable.

Civil unrest was beginning to show its ugly head. Italians who had served Rome faithfully wanted as many rights as any Roman citizen.

Small farmers who were the backbone of Rome’s military were being displaced due to economic change and continuous military deployment which had resulted in their losing their farms. This sent many of them into the cities looking for work. The effect was a shortage in military enlistment because there was no incentive in fighting slaves or Spanish rebels.

It was during this time that Rome embarked on a welfare policy that would dog her until her final days.

In the ancient world, just as today, wild fluctuations in grain prices or even famine could be caused by many things but chief among these causes in the ancient world was the transportation of grain to market.

Thus, in 123 BC the Roman tribune, Gaius Gracchus, instituted a policy in which the state would procure a sufficient supply of wheat to be sold to all who were willing to stand in line at one of the public granaries for his monthly allotment. The grain was to be sold at a price below the normal market price and was to be fixed by the Roman state.

Gaius was not seeking to establish a welfare subsidy. He was trying to stabilize the seasonal fluctuations in the grain prices. Gaius hoped to insure that the Roman citizens would be paying the same price for grain throughout the year.

As with all state policies, the good intentions of the statists involved soon deteriorated into a monstrosity of Biblical proportions.

In about 90 BC the grain subsidies were abolished under the dictatorship of Lucius Sulla but by 73 BC the Roman state was once again providing grain at a fixed price to the Roman ""poor.""

It was in 58 BC that the tribune of the people and common thug, Publius Clodius Pulcher, Cicero’s arch enemy, abolished the charge on grain and threw open Rome’s granaries to the public. The outcome of this action was that the rural poor flooded into the city of Rome while slave holders freed their own slaves putting them on the public dole thus cutting their cost of feeding the ""help.""

It is doubtful that there is a coincidence in the fact that 58 BC is also the year Rome made inroads into controlling Egypt and it grain harvests when Ptolemy XI sought Roman aid through Pompey to regain his throne.

The supply of grain had always been important but now it was critical, due to the political necessity of keeping the population of Rome happy and fed at the state’s expense. From here on Rome would expend vast amounts of time, energy and resources devoted to securing Rome’s grain supply; even to the degree that grants of citizenship and duty exemptions, were extended to ship-owners who signed exclusive contracts to convey grain to the city of Rome.

Rome had traditionally received its grain from various elements of Italy most notably southern Italy on the Tyrrhenian Sea and from the provinces of Sicily and North Africa. Now, Egypt took on a new and important role in Rome’s survival.

When Julius Caesar took the reigns of power there were about 320,000 men receiving free grain (which he would ultimately cut to around 150,000) and the system was out of control. Therefore there is a strong likelihood that there was far more involved than Julius Caesar’s libido when he took up with the Egyptian femme fatale Cleopatra VII.

You would think Rome’s grain give-a-way would have a drastic, negative effect on the free market. It didn’t, although it did have a negative effect on the Roman citizen’s taxes.

The reason is probably twofold. First, Rome’s free grain was not obtainable by women, children, slaves, government officials, foreigners, or any outsider who was not a citizen of Rome. Second, the ration of grain was not sufficient to live on. It was left to a large, healthy, and private free market to supply the vast needs of Rome.

What isn’t in dispute is that the reason Egypt retained its Hellenistic economic system and was not allowed to share in the generally profitable freedom of the Roman Empire was that Egypt was now Rome’s main source of grain. Safeguarding of this grain source was critical to Rome’s survival and so Egypt always was to remain exclusively in the ownership of the Roman emperor.

It should also go without question that Egypt’s importance to Rome’s well-being was not lost on either Marc Antony or Cleopatra.

What had happened is that the Roman Republic in Cicero’s day lay in ruins. What once had been the nobility and upper classes had been devastated by years of war. The once guiding ""constitution"" of the Republic had been changed, circumvented, redefined, or ignored for so long and in such strange ways that it was almost impossible to remember what the original Republic actually was like.

Rome’s economy was on the verge of being reduced to rubble, the food supplies were in peril, while hundreds of thousands of people were either homeless or displaced.

This is the Roman world Cicero faced. Is it any wonder he longed for the old days of the Republic? His choices were simple; absolute evil (Marcus Antonius) or the lesser of the two evils (Gaius Octavius). Cicero chose Octavius and in so doing launched a blistering attack against Marc Antony in his Phillipics against evil and for the Roman Republic.

It was too much for Marc Antony and in 43 BC Cicero was declared a criminal then eventually murdered by one of Antony’s goon squads. After Cicero’s death Antony had Cicero’s head and right hand removed then placed in the rostrum where Cicero had made his speeches; the warning did not go without notice.

Here in 2008 Americans are faced with selecting their next president. Given the choice between McCain, Obama, or Clinton they can only hope a civil war doesn’t settle the issue because it is a forgone conclusion that every other problem America faces will be either ignored or exacerbated.

One thing is certain: in 2100 years the bulk of the human race hasn’t learned a blessed thing!

For me the choice between evil and evil is still evil and so I’ll be content to sit, watch and prepare for the worst. I know the American public is going to select a devil that can’t be controlled.

469871,"I don't remember my first kiss or even who it was with. I can barely recollect getting my license to drive. I vaguely remember my high school graduation and my entire time spent at college is a blur. However, I remember exactly where I was, what I was wearing, and how I felt when I got my first survival knife over 20 years ago. Just thinking about it brings back some of my fondest childhood memories. It was the RAMBO knife with the hollow handle that housed a little fishing kit along with a few other miscellaneous items. My love affair with knives began at a young age, and I've been hooked ever since. Movies seem to always have the coolest survival knives, but does the survival knife really have a place in the “real world?”

That was a rhetorical question. Yes, it most certainly does.

According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), 2010 marked the highest number of disasters in one year for the United States — totaling in at 91. The disaster tally in 1953 was only 13, and it has been gradually increasing ever since. Despite our advancements in medicine, technology, travel, and communications, millions of people across the globe face disaster and its merciless consequences each year. In addition, thousands of individuals are thrust into unexpected and unpredictable life or death situations where survival depends on experience, knowledge, and the resources on hand. My point? It is wise to keep important survival resources close by — just in case. One of your most important survival tools is a quality knife. The cutting blade has carved itself an indispensable place in survival history. For thousands of years, man has depended on a cutting tool of some kind to help meet basic survival needs: food, water, fire, and shelter. Now, in our modern society, we casually refer to this blade as the “survival knife.” It has certainly earned that name. However, not all survival knives are created equal.

I have the privilege of strapping a survival knife to my hip on almost a daily basis here at Willow Haven. I completely understand, though, that this isn't practical for most. At a minimum, a survival knife should be kept accessible. You might be surprised how often you'll use it — even if not in a survival situation. I never travel without my survival knife. I pack it in my checked baggage on the plane. I keep it on my hotel nightstand. It's always in the console of my truck when road-tripping, and I never set off for an adventure without it. Whether fishing, backpacking, hunting, boating, skiing, hiking, or camping, my knife is a trusted companion. I'm rarely more than a stone's throw away from it at any given moment.

A “survival knife” is just as it sounds — a knife that can help you survive. It is a tool with literally hundreds of survival-related functions. Below is a short list:

Cutting/Slicing

Digging

Splitting

Self-Defense

First Aid Tool

Food Prep

Shelter Building

Fire Making

Hunting Weapon

Prying Tool

Signaling

Hammering

Make-Shift Screwdriver

When it comes to your survival knife, less is typically more — despite what you may see on TV. Hang the cool movie prop knife on a wall and embrace the simplicity of a skillfully designed survival knife. Function trumps styling — always. Your first priority is performance and that will depend on a variety of time-tested key features.

6 Important Survival Knife Features

Survival Knife Feature #1: Size

Does size matter? Yes, but when it comes to your survival knife, bigger is not always better. If your blade is too big, you sacrifice the ability to effectively use it for detailed tasks such as dressing small game or carving precision snare sets.

On the flip-side, a small blade does not perform well with more rugged tasks such as batoning and chopping. Batoning is when you strike the back of your knife blade with a heavy object to drive the knife through thick or stubborn wood. This allows the blade to be used for splitting wood and cutting through large limbs and trees.

Having used many survival knives, I've found the ideal size to be around 9-11 inches in length. For example, my Blackbird SK-5 survival knife pictured below is 10u201D in OVERALL length with a 5u201D blade.

Survival Knife Feature #2: Fixed Blade

A fixed blade knife is more durable and reliable than a folding knife. While I love a good folder for Every Day Carry (EDC), a fixed blade has the upper hand when it comes to meeting the demands a survival situation might present.

A joint of any kind is a weakness. Minimize the risk of damaging or losing your key survival resource by choosing a knife that is better suited for pounding, chopping, thrusting, prying, and rigorous cutting.

Survival Knife Feature #3: Full Tang

Not only should your survival knife be a fixed blade, but it should also be FULL TANG. “Full tang” indicates that the blade and handle are constructed from one continuous piece of metal. Scales or grips are typically attached to the handle portion for a more comfortable grip. A full tang knife is much more robust than partial tang styles such as the half tang, push tang, or rat-tail tang. As you can see in the photo below, the profile of a full tang blade is much more substantial than its rat-tail friend.

Over time, partial tang knife blades can loosen and develop “play” in the handle — especially under demanding tasks such as batoning, prying, and chopping. If a partial tang blade comes loose from the handle it can be very difficult (and dangerous) to use effectively. In contrast, a full tang knife blade is still very functional even if the scales come off. It can be wrapped with cordage for added comfort and grip.

There is absolutely no advantage in choosing a partial tang blade over a full tang design for your survival knife. It's difficult to break a solid piece of continuous metal. An easy way to spot a full tang knife is to look for the metal tang sandwiched between the knife's scales. Below are a few examples. *Note: Not all full tang knife blades have an exposed tang as shown in these examples.

373664,"When it hits the fan America’s population centers will explode in violence, looting, and total breakdown of law and order.

It’s a theory put forth by numerous survival and relocation specialists, and one that makes complete sense if you consider what happens in a truly serious collapse-like scenario.

Survival Blog founder James Rawles calls them the golden horde:

Because of the urbanization of the U.S. population, if the entire eastern or western power grid goes down for more than a week, the cities will rapidly become unlivable. I foresee that there will be an almost unstoppable chain of events: Power -> water -> food distribution -> law and order -> arson fires -> full scale looting

In his recent documentary Strategic Relocation, retreat expert Joel Skousen echoes Rawles’ warnings:

The number one threat that I concentrate on. It’s not terrorism, it’s not natural disaster, it’s not even government or war. The major threat is population density. Because every crisis that threatens, even a local crisis, can turn exponential because of close proximity to people who cannot help themselves. Even good people panic in a crisis…

So, where should you be when it happens?

To find the answer, let’s consider where we shouldn’t be.

Recent U.S. census data indicates that out of the 3000 counties in the United States, fully 50% of the population lives in just 146.

If you want to have any chance of surviving a wide-spread catastrophic event by avoiding the hordes that will be searching for critical resources in its aftermath, then check out the following map to get a visual reference of the areas you want to stay away from.

(Click here for larger image)

(For a complete list of the counties highlighted on this map click here)

When considering your retreat locations or emergency evacuation routes, be familiar with the population densities of the area you’re headed to, as well as those counties in your immediate vicinity.

So, no matter where you are located, consider your proximity to high traffic thoroughfares going in and out of the city. During Hurricane Rita, which hit Houston several years ago, every major pipeline out of the city was jammed for hundreds of miles. Interstate 45 from Houston to Dallas was bumper to bumper traffic. Normally a 4 hour trip, those who didn’t evacuate in time were stuck on the highway without food, gas, sanitation, or potable water for upwards of 15 hours.

This is why Joel Skousen suggests that those looking for strategic retreat locations or homes outside of major cities consider highway proximity. Be at least 5 – 7 miles away from any major thoroughfare, which is generally outside the range people want to venture off familiar roads, and far enough away to make any ‘walkers’ too tired to attempt the trip without ample clean water and food.

If you have no choice but to be in a major metro area during a serious emergency situation, consider strategies that can help you remain sustainable in the city even in the midst of panic.

What is the “worst nightmare” one can imagine in an encounter between a police officer and a member of the productive class? One answer is offered by the experience of Eric Garner, who died after being choked and swarmed without cause by a thugscrum of NYPD officers. That nightmare continues for his wife, his six children, his grandchildren, and others who were deprived of his company because of an unprovoked act of criminal aggression by privileged purveyors of government-sanctioned violence.

What, on the other hand, is the “worst nightmare” for a police officer in such a situation? In a single word, accountability.

“We have watched in disbelief as the worst nightmare a police officer can have comes true,” simpers retired Jersey City police officer Robert Cubby in a post at LawEnforcementToday.com “An NYPD officer applied what was falsely called a choke hold. Moments later, the perpetrator gasped for air and died in the hospital.”

These two developments, Cubby would have us pretend, were not necessarily related. It’s not that Garner’s government-employed assailants killed him; he just chose that particular moment to die.

Since 1993, NYPD policy has described any move that constricts the breathing passages as a chokehold, and the use of such tactics is categorically forbidden. Under a New York State law that went into effect in 2011, aggressive contact with the throat of another person is attempted strangulation and is a felony if the victim suffers a serious injury. Cubby either doesn’t know the policy of the department that employed Garner’s assailants, the law they were supposedly sworn to uphold, or — more likely — is lying in the service of his tax-devouring tribe.

Now that the death of Garner — who was not a “perpetrator” of any sort, but a man who had just broken up a fight — has been ruled a homicide, the “career of those involved from the NYPD dangles from a thread,” moans Cubby. “The officers face the worst possible nightmare; loss of their career and being thrown in jail for a good portion of the rest of their lives.”

The same would be true of anybody else who fatally assaulted another human being without cause. Cubby and people of his ilk assume that police officers must be beyond accountability for such actions, and that the loss of their exalted station as dispensers of lethal force is a fate worse than death.

“While these officers now become defendants and have to, somehow, gather enough emotional strength to get through this horrible accusation [and] gather all their financial resources to defend themselves, stay out of jail and retain their jobs, it is time for the LEO family to support our NYPD brothers and sisters,” insists Cubby. He wants the state’s armed enforcement class to display its solidarity with Garner’s killers through a “United We Stand with NYPD” social media campaign: Law enforcement officers and their friends are urged to change their Facebook profile picture to an upside-down NYPD flag. That green, white, and blue banner, which was adopted by the department in 1919, is draped over the coffins of officers who are killed in the line of duty.

If a costumed tax-feeder can’t kill without consequence, what’s the point of living?

Recently by Andrew P. Napolitano: Guns and Freedom

If you have listened to President Obama and Vice President Biden talk about guns in the past month, you have heard them express a decided commitment to use the powers of the federal government to maintain safety in the United States. You also have heard congressional voices from politicians in both parties condemning violence and promising to do something about it. This sounds very caring and inside the wheelhouse of what we hire and pay the federal government to do.

But it is clearly unconstitutional.

When the Founders created the American republic, they did so by inducing constitutional conventions in each of the original 13 states to ratify the new Constitution. The idea they presented, and the thesis accepted by those ratifying conventions, was that the states are sovereign; they derive their powers from the people who live there. The purpose of the Constitution was to create a federal government of limited powers — powers that had been delegated to it by the states. The opening line of the Constitution contains a serious typographical error: ""We the People"" should read ""We the States."" As President Ronald Reagan reminded us in his first inaugural address, the states created the federal government and not the other way around.

Notwithstanding the Constitution's typo, the states delegated only 16 unique, discrete powers to the new federal government, and all of those powers concern nationhood. The Constitution authorizes the feds to regulate in areas of national defense, foreign affairs, keeping interstate commerce regular, establishing a post office, protecting patents and artistic creations, and keeping the nation free. The areas of health, safety, welfare and morality were not delegated to the feds and were retained by the States.

How do we know that? We know it from the language in the Constitution itself and from the records of the debates in the state ratifying conventions. The small-government types, who warned at these conventions that the Constitution was creating a behemoth central government not unlike the one in Great Britain from which they had all just seceded, were assured that the unique separation of powers between the states and the new limited federal government would guarantee that power could not become concentrated in the central government.

It was articulated even by the big-government types in the late 18th century — such as George Washington and Alexander Hamilton — as well as by the small-government types — such as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison — that the new government was limited to the powers delegated to it by the states and the states retained the governmental powers that they did not delegate away. At Jefferson's insistence, the Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution to keep the new government from interfering with natural rights such as speech, worship, self-defense, privacy and property rights, and the 10th Amendment was included to assure that the Constitution itself would proclaim affirmatively that the powers not delegated to the feds were retained by the states or the people.

The Supreme Court has ruled consistently and countless times that the ""police power,"" that is, the power to regulate for health, safety, welfare and morality, continues to be reposed in the states, and that there is no federal police power. All of this is consistent with the philosophical principle of ""subsidiarity,"" famously articulated by St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas argued that the problems that are closest to the people needing government intervention should be addressed by the government closest to those people. Its corollary is that all governmental intervention should be the minimum needed.

Now, back to Obama and Biden and their colleagues in the government. If the feds have no legitimate role in maintaining safety, why are they getting involved in the current debate over guns? We know that they don't trust individuals to address their own needs, from food to health to safety, and they think — the Constitution to the contrary notwithstanding — that they know better than we do how to care for ourselves. Obama and Biden and many of their colleagues in government are the same folks who gave us Obamacare, with its mandates, invasions of privacy, increased costs and federal regulation of health care. They call themselves progressives, as they believe that the federal government possesses unlimited powers and can do whatever those who run it want it to do, except that which is expressly prohibited.

This brings us back to guns. The Constitution expressly prohibits all governments from infringing upon the right of the people to keep and bear arms. This permits us to defend ourselves when the police can't or won't, and it permits a residue of firepower in the hands of the people with which to stop any tyrant who might try to infringe upon our natural rights, and it will give second thoughts to anyone thinking about tyranny.

The country is ablaze with passionate debate about guns, and the government is determined to do something about it. Debate over public policy is good for freedom. But the progressives want to use the debate to justify the coercive power of the government to infringe upon the rights of law-abiding folks because of what some crazies among us have done. We must not permit this to happen.

The whole purpose of the Constitution is to insulate personal freedom from the lust for power of those in government and from the passions of the people who sent them there.

The TSA’s brute who opened and spilled the container of ashes passenger John Gross was transporting from Florida to his home in Indiana — and then laughed as Mr. Gross scrambled to pick up “bone fragments” from the floor — has infuriated folks across the country. It is the scandal du semaine — then again, we’re only halfway through the week, and I have every confidence the TSA can top even this horror in the next three days — for the agency right now, the subject of 5 of the 8 “News” “results” my Google Alert on the TSA kicked up. Even the UK’s Daily Mail featured the story. And a friend whose office is too hectic for any other than the most earth-shattering news to penetrate mentioned it when we bumped into each other yesterday. Everyone has heard about it, and everyone is enraged.

Fortunately, the TSA has had plenty of experience infuriating and enraging the serfs who pay its bills. It should be a pro by now at dealing with such absolutely devastating publicity. Judge for yourself how much its boneheads have learned by their response to this atrocity: After babbling about how “TSA recognizes the importance of screening human remains with utmost respect and dignity” — which its goon manifestly did not do — its “statement” continues, “We have been unable to reach the family to learn more about their perspective on the incident [sic for ‘to threaten them with the No-List if they don’t shut up’; good for you, Mr. Gross — keep avoiding these monsters, is my advice], however, our initial review concluded that the circumstances as described in some reports are inconsistent with what we believe transpired.”

So in addition to the savage abuse Mr. Gross suffered at the checkpoint, the TSA now smears him as a liar. This from professional, serial, psychopathic, utterly-incapable-of-telling-the-truth liars.

Meanwhile, the reason “TSA policy” commands “that under no circumstance should a container holding remains be opened” is because it’s against the law. Departments of “health” forbid it. So Mr. Gross may have the last laugh on his cachinnating dimwit after all if cops arrest her for violating state or local regs — just as they have arrested her colleagues for such other examples of lawbreaking as theft. (No, I’m not endorsing the “health” dictators or their regs, just pointing out that Dimwit committed a crime as Leviathan defines it.)

73875,"The observant will have noticed that we hear little from the troops in Iraq and see almost nothing of the wounded. Why, one might wonder, does not CNN put an enlisted Marine before a camera and, for fifteen minutes without editing, let him say what he thinks? Is he not an adult and a citizen? Is he not engaged in important events on our behalf?

Sound political reasons exist. Soldiers are a risk PR-wise, the wounded a liability. No one can tell what they might say, and conspicuous dismemberment is bad for recruiting. An enlisted man in front of a camera is dangerous. He could wreck the governmental spin apparatus in five minutes. It is better to keep soldiers discreetly out of sight.

So we do not see much of the casualties, ours or theirs. Yet they are there, are somewhere, with missing legs, blind, becoming accustomed to groping at things in their new darkness, learning to use the wheelchairs that will be theirs for fifty years. Some face worse fates than others. Quadriplegics will be warehoused in VA hospitals where nurses will turn them at intervals, like hamburgers, to prevent bedsores. Friends and relatives will soon forget them. Suicide will be a frequent thought. The less damaged will get around.

For a brief moment perhaps the casualties will believe, then try desperately to keep believing, that they did something brave and worthy and terribly important for that abstraction, country. Some will even expect thanks. There will be no thanks, or few, and those quickly forgotten. It will be worse. People will ask how they lost the leg. In Iraq, they will say, hoping for sympathy, or respect, or understanding. The response, often unvoiced but unmistakable, will be, What did you do that for? The wounded will realize that they are not only crippled, but freaks.

The years will go by. Iraq will fade into the mist. Wars always do. A generation will rise for whom it will be just history. The dismembered veterans will find first that almost nobody appreciates what they did, then that few even remember it. If — when, many would say — the United States is driven out of Iraq, the soldiers will look back and realize that the whole affair was a fraud. Wars are just wars. They seem important at the time. At any rate, we are told that they are important.

Yet the wounds will remain. Arms do not grow back. For the paralyzed there will never be girlfriends, dancing, rolling in the grass with children. The blind will adapt as best they can. Those with merely a missing leg will count themselves lucky. They will hobble about, managing to lead semi-normal lives, and people will say, How well he handles it. An admirable freak. For others it will be less good. A colostomy bag is a sorry companion on a wedding night.

These men will come to hate. It will not be the Iraqis they hate. This we do not talk about.

It is hard to admit that one has been used. Some of the crippled will forever insist that the war was needed, that they were protecting their sisters from an Islamic invasion, or Vietnamese, or Chinese. Others will keep quiet and drink too much. Still others will read, grow older and wiser — and bitter. They will remember that their vice president, a man named Cheney, said that during his war, the one in Asia, he had other priorities. The veterans will remember this when everyone else has long since forgotten Cheney.

I once watched the first meeting between a young Marine from the South, blind, much of his face shot away, and his high school sweetheart who had come from Tennessee to Bethesda Naval Hospital to see him.

Hatred comes easily.

There are wounds and there are wounds. A friend of mine spent two tours in Asia in that war now little remembered. He killed many people, not all of them soldiers. It is what happens in wars. The memory haunts him. Jack is a hard man from a tough neighborhood, quick with his fists, intelligent but uneducated — not a liberal flower vain over his sensitivity. He lives in Mexican bars few would enter and has no politics beyond an anger toward government.

He was not a joyous killer. He remembers what he did, knows now that he was had. It gnaws at him. One is wise to stay away from him when he is drinking.

People say that this war isn’t like Viet Nam. They are correct. Washington fights its war in Iraq with no better understanding of Iraq than it had of Viet Nam, but with much better understanding of the United States. The Pentagon learned from Asia. This time around it has controlled the press well. Here is the great lesson of Southeast Asia: The press is dangerous, not because it is inaccurate, which it often is, but because it often isn’t.

So we don’t much see the caskets — for reasons of privacy, you understand.

The war in Iraq is fought by volunteers, which means people that no one in power cares about. No one in the mysteriously named elite gives a damn about some kid from a town in Tennessee that has one gas station and a beer hall with a stuffed buck’s head. Such a kid is a redneck at best, pretty much from another planet, and certainly not someone you would let your daughter date. If conscription came back, and college students with rich parents learned to live in fear of The Envelope, riots would blossom as before. Now Yale can rest easy. Thank God for throwaway people.

The nearly perfect separation between the military and the rest of the country, or at least the influential in the country, is wonderful for the war effort. It prevents concern. How many people with a college degree even know a soldier? Yes, some, and I will get email from them, but they are a minority. How many Americans have been on a military base? Or, to be truly absurd, how many men in combat arms went to, say, Harvard?

Ah, but they have other priorities.

In fifteen years in Washington I knew many, many reporters and intellectuals and educated people. Almost none had worn boots. So it is. Those who count do not have to go, and do not know anyone who has gone, and don’t interest themselves. There is a price for this, though not one Washington cares about. Across America, in places where you might not expect it — in Legion halls and VFW posts, among those who carry membership cards from the Disabled American Veterans — there are men who hate. They don’t hate America. They hate those who sent them. Talk to the wounded from Iraq in five years.

402062,"On August 2, for the first time in 52 years, I went to a movie that I had seen the day before. The last time I did this, it was The Day the Earth Stood Still, which I actually saw twice on day two, being forced in between showings to suffer a second viewing of Two Dollar Bettor, starring John Litel. The recent movie was Seabiscuit.

From the opening scene of Seabiscuit, I knew I was seeing a contender. It opens strong, and it finishes ahead by three lengths. While there can always be a dark horse, Seabiscuit is likely to be in the winner’s circle at the Academy Awards next year. (Movie reviewers are unlikely to resist the use of numerous horse racing metaphors, mostly lame.)

The opening scene normally would have shouted, “Dud!” When was the last time you saw a movie that was not a dud which opened with an historical voice-over? A decade ago, Tombstone did, but it was a Western, and the narrator was Robert Mitchum, and he didn’t intrude again, once the opening credits were over.

THE NARRATOR

In Seabiscuit, the narrator keeps coming back all through the movie. This has long been the kiss of death, circumstantial evidence that the director gave up trying to fit the jagged scenes into a coherent whole. Even more remarkable, the movie’s scenes are intermittently interrupted by sequences of black-and-white photos from the 1930’s. The narrator then explains the era, with the photos as supporting exhibits. The narrator just won’t shut up. Incredibly, you don’t want him to shut up. That’s because it’s David McCullough, the historical narrator of our generation.

McCullough first narrated his way into our lives in The Civil War, Ken Burns’ incomparably successful PBS documentary, which did not have a single living human being in any historical scene. McCullough has graced other documentaries by Burns, but The Civil War remains their joint masterpiece.

Our generation of sporadically educated Americans sits in front of its TV screens, overwhelmed by sequences of historical images, and cries out, “Tell us what is going on, Mr. McCullough. We are lost.” Then his voice — not imperious, yet not exactly soothing, either — comes on, and we become more calm. Like children on their father’s lap, looking through his scrap book, our generation’s perception of the past gets put back together by his comforting narratives.

David McCullough writes as well as he speaks. There is no more compelling spinner of historical narratives in our day. Anyone who can make John Adams into as lively and even likeable a figure as his wife Abigail was is nothing short of a narrative alchemist, turning lead into at least gold plate. (I say this as a professionally certified though rusty historian.) The only man who could have given McCullough a run for the narrative money in our day is Gore Vidal, who adopted the historical novel instead. Vidal recognized McCullough’s narrative gifts early, in his August 13, 1981 review of McCullough’s book on Theodore Roosevelt’s youth, Mornings on Horseback — a review, sadly, that has been removed from the public Web, now that the New York Review of Books has gone ruthlessly capitalistic and charges money for access to its archives.

THE THEMES

McCullough begins by setting the scene for the movie, a summary of Henry Ford’s incomparable achievement. When Ford began, we are told, his plant could assemble one car in 13 hours. Five years later, it was one car every 90 seconds. Ford’s technique, the conveyor belt-driven production line, was then widely imitated, McCullough says. This changed everything, he says. Well, it really did change everything. It made America into a mass-production society. It made Americans rich. McCullough’s voice-over and the photo images make this truth clear.

Perfect.

The movie begins with automobiles. A contrast is present throughout the movie: the sport of kings vs. the age of the automobile. Seabiscuit’s owner is a highly successful car salesman who had not ridden a horse in two decades in 1933.

The deliberate irony of both the book and the movie is that the common man, empowered as never before by the automobile, supposedly turned for inspiration to horse racing, and one horse in particular, during an era in which, in the immortal phrase of Will Rogers, America became the first nation to go to the poorhouse in an automobile.

The narrative and the dialogue put into the mouth of Seabiscuit’s owner create the image of Seabiscuit as the discarded horse of great lineage, who performed well only late in life, beating the other thoroughbreds. Yes, we are told, he was a thoroughbred, but he would have been the runt of the litter if horses were born in litters. This made him a horse of choice for the common man to cheer.

His owner, Charles Howard, started out as a bicycle repairman-turned salesman whose product was outmoded. A series of half a dozen scenes, spanning at most two days, are brilliantly crafted to tell the story of his transition from a failed bicycle salesman to a rich car dealer. This really is the story of the great age of entrepreneurship: a man with an untried technical skill who sees a better way to do the job, and who gets rich as a result. I have never seen this truth more effectively portrayed on-screen. Its brevity and its subtlety are nothing short of artistry. McCullough’s narrative on Ford and his era had introduced this theme perfectly. The scenes of the young bicycle salesman who finds his calling and makes a fortune confirm the narrative perfectly.

McCullough’s narrative insists that mass production was the beginning and end of imagination. I have no idea what this means, but I am sure of this much: the director asks the audience to employ imagination on an unprecedented scale. In these scenes, Jeff Bridges, age 53, plays a man of 30, and gets away with it.

There is another thematic contrast, and it is not particularly subtle. McCullough tells us that in 1900, a common but gifted man could make a huge fortune. The movie shows this through Howard. Then, without warning, we are thrown into 1929 and the stock market crash. This takes place immediately after a speech by Howard on the unlimited potential of the future. This sets the scene for the movie’s rival theme: the Great Depression and the need for hope.

At one point, McCullough’s voice returns and narrates a series of Burns-like photographs of people employed by the New Deal’s tax-funded make-work projects. McCullough identifies this as relief, and it came with many names, he says: CCC, WPA, etc. Relief, he says, demonstrated for the first time in a long time that “someone cared.” But who was this “someone”? The sequence of photos ends with a photo of a common man alongside Franklin D. Roosevelt. Nothing needs to be said for anyone older than Jeff Bridges.

In the high-stakes race for the Academy Award, Seabiscuit at this point rounds the first turn and races ahead by two lengths.

Here is the movie’s main central theme: little guys, creative at their core, yet nonetheless little guys, symbolize America. They challenge the establishment and win. To believe this regarding anything connected with thoroughbred horse racing is the equivalent of believing that Jeff Bridges might possibly be 30. It takes great imagination and a willing suspension of disbelief.

THE PHOTOGRAPHY

The photography is breathtaking. It is quite properly reminiscent of the movie’s sire, The Black Stallion. The scenes of wild horses racing on the Great Plains, the galloping Seabiscuit on various horse farms, the in-pack scenes on the race tracks are simply spectacular. The pounding of the hooves put us in the middle of the races. Again, The Black Stallion is the obvious model.

This movie must be seen on a big screen. Even a large screen, high definition, home entertainment television set will not do it justice, let alone my 1987 20-inch model with the rattling plastic speaker box.

THE MUSIC

Randy Newman is one of a handful of composers who will be remembered in a century as the creators of the only orchestral music of the twentieth century that is worth listening to, other than Aaron Copeland. All of these men have written for Hollywood movies. Think of Jerry Goldsmith (Star Trek, Patton) and John Williams (Star Wars). Would anyone residing outside of New York City’s Upper East Side openly admit that he prefers to listen to Igor Stravinsky or John Cage? Really?

Newman not only wrote the film’s orchestral music, he assembled a series of unexpected overlays for some of the early race scenes. The first race features a powerful, fiddle-centered country music band. The speed and power of racing are emphasized by the music. In a later race, he selected a bluegrass band that I cannot identify playing a song that I have never heard, and it works. As Seabiscuit’s story develops and the tension builds, Newman superimposes good, old-fashioned majestic Hollywood orchestral music over the races. It works. It all works.

One of the early secrets of the success of American movies was the fusion of music with visual images. As early as King Kong, the music helped shape the movie. Try to imagine O Brother, Where Art Thou? without a sound track. The British caught on earlier than Europe did, but it took them decades. How many French movies in the 1960’s had some gangster car chase scene, with light jazz as the background? I could provide an accurate estimate if I went to a French movie more than once every thirty years. (The French are a nation of self-proclaimed aesthetes who think Jerry Lewis is hilarious.)

THE ACTING

There is not one bad performance, not one miscast actor or actress. But William H. Macy, once again, proves that he is the scene thief of our generation. It is a thing of wonder to behold. He comes on-screen, accompanied only by an unnamed, rarely speaking blonde, and deftly picks the collective pockets of the entire cast. He doesn’t do it once; he keeps doing it, scene after scene. I can almost imagine him returning each wallet, now empty, to each of the cast members, who are meekly lined up against the wall. He walks down the line saying, “Thank you. Thank you so much. I really did appreciate this opportunity. Again, thank you.”

The only time when I harbor any doubt that Macy is the greatest on-screen character actor of our day, the top second banana of them all, is when Gary Sinese is on-screen. Then I have no doubt that Sinese is the uncrowned title-holder. Someday, there should be a match race between these two, probably with Tom Hanks as the producer, who will keep most of the gate’s receipts.

If Macy doesn’t get best supporting actor for this role, then Sinese had better have a major role later in the year. Macy is just perfect.

THE IMPERFECTIONS

The first imperfection is chronological. We see the newspaper headlines of the 1929 stock market crash. Then we see scenes of a campground, where the family of the young jockey-to-be Red Pollard now lives. This obviously is 1932 or thereabouts — well into the depression. Pollard’s parents then abandon him. The screen fades. The next image says “six years later.” We see an adult Red Pollard beginning his career as a jockey. Yet six years would make it at least 1938 — the year of Seabiscuit’s great race with War Admiral, at the peak of Pollard’s career. Then, without explanation, the movie takes us to 1933, when Pollard is a journeyman jockey in Mexico. Couldn’t anyone in the script department add?

The second imperfection is the repeated outbursts of both profanity and obscenity by Pollard. This was not necessary for the script. But it was necessary for the producers and script writers, who shape public sensibilities by constantly assaulting public standards, decade after decade. “Jesus Christ” is a repeated expletive on Hollywood’s screens. Yet, in a way, these artistic masters of the celluloid universe can assault the Christian West’s definition of profanity only by affirming what they privately deny: that this is in fact profanity. “Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain” (Exodus 20:7).

If America were ever to go Islamic, Hollywood’s producers and performers would not have a hero say on-screen that “Muhammed humped pigs.” Muslims are less tolerant and less pluralistic than Christians. Hollywood’s performers would rather attend the Academy Awards than funerals, especially their own. They are therefore selective in their choice and use of profanity.

It boils down to this, as movie reviewer and Orthodox Jew Michael Medved has said so forcefully: It’s Hollywood vs. America and Hollywood vs. Religion. In one scene, Seabiscuit’s owners and crew are in church. The owner and his wife are singing a hymn. The trainer, his assistant, and the jockey aren’t. That isn’t the Bible they’re reading, either. The last words of the movie are the jockey’s voice-over. He tells us that the horse and his human associates mutually healed each other. The best I can say for that affirmation of redemption is that, while it gave God no credit, at least it didn’t credit it to Franklin D. Roosevelt.

At one point in the movie, Seabiscuit’s owner tells his wife, “You show me something that’s perfect, and I’ll show you something that’s not.” Hollywood has a war in progress, and this war keeps the industry from producing perfect movies.

But this movie comes close.

THE LOSER

There is only one identifiable loser, Laura Hillenbrand, the book‘s author, who somehow came to the conclusion that the story of Seabiscuit needed re-telling, and who told it well. She is a true literary entrepreneur. But she suffers from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Today, she is so sick that she does not grant interviews.

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome turned my wife into a pain-ridden semi-invalid in 1987. She was cured in 1988 by a week of treatments on an electronic machine. Actor James Coburn experienced similar deliverance from the arthritis that had crippled his hands and his career. Subsequently, both the inventor and his machine were forced out of the United States by the U.S. government, a story I have told previously on this Web site. Today, with only a few working machines remaining in the possession of the inventor’s lone successor, one woman quietly and without fanfare treats desperate people like Mrs. Hillenbrand. She has only one requirement: that they do not go public about the means of their deliverance.

Henry Ford’s innovation of mass production has been coercively re-directed by the same government that the narrator of Seabiscuit tells us became the agency that cared during the Great Depression. Were it not for that caring bureaucratic friend, Mrs. Hillenbrand could probably buy one of these machines for a few hundred dollars — maybe less.

If that day ever arrives, one thing is sure: somewhere on its exterior, there will be a stamp that says “Made in China.” Henry Ford’s innovation lives on in the most unlikely places.

216169,"by Myles Kantor

Charles R. Kesler's ""The Republican Challenge"" (National Review, September 11, 2000) is a fantastic illustration of how Republican intellectuals are hell-bent on severing what ties they retain with republican principles. Kesler, a government professor at Claremont McKenna College and senior fellow at the Claremont Institute, also finds major fault in the GOP, arguing ""The Republican party still lacks a confident, well-grounded sense of itself and its moral purpose."" What is the solution to this identity crisis? George W.

Bush must ""reclaim the moral high ground for his party, with a new politics in the Lincoln tradition.""

Now National Review is supposedly a conservative publication, so it's odd to find Kesler's prescription in its pages. (I'm being only somewhat sarcastic.) But let's delve into Kesler's exposition of his thesis:

""The original Lincoln Republicans stood for liberty and Union, in the form of popular, constitutional government. Liberty meant that all human beings were created free and equal; slavery was therefore wrong. Union meant that out of many individuals, an indivisible people had been formed; secession was therefore wrong. Popular, constitutional government meant that government had to be limited, and to operate with the consent of the governed; tyranny, whether of a majority or a minority, was therefore wrong.""

As befits a neoconservative analysis, Kesler mixes validity with distortion. He's right that slavery violated the inalienable rights Jefferson affirmed in the Declaration of Independence. (I part company with some 19th century Southern conservatives, many of them perspicacious, who considered Jefferson in error.) He's also correct to underscore the consensual, enumerated nature of American government and its provisions against numerical tyranny of either stripe. (States' rights are a salient provision; consider the Senate.) Given these good points, it's incongruent (to understate matters) that Kesler attributes their fulfillment to the foremost revolutionary in American political history: Abraham Lincoln.

Lincoln was a revolutionary because he mangled American philosophical and constitutional moorings. (The latter builds on the former, so they're somewhat synonymous.) Whether in suspending habeas corpus, imposing military tribunals, or assuming fiscal power  but a partial listing  Lincoln again and again showed contempt for separation of powers, enumerated government  that whole rule of law thing. (Biographer David Donald captures a representative moment when he notes that Lincoln ""threatened to jail and exile judges who used the writ of habeas corpus to interfere with the draft."") Kesler doesn't address Lincoln's executive totalism, which isn't surprising; the Lincoln ilk tends toward rhapsodic generalities  ""He saved the Union,"" ""He protected government of by and for the people,"" etc. (Clinton Rossiter  whose edition of The Federalist Papers features a new introduction and notes from Kesler  gives a specific analysis in Constitutional Dictatorship: Crisis Government in the Modern Democracies. In a curious pattern among many Lincoln apologists, Rossiter describes his ""unabashed presidential encroachment upon the power of Congress"" and goes on to write of ""Lincoln's noble actions."")

As for Kesler's generalities, they manifest the primary symptom of neoconservative constitutionalism: the conflation of federalism and nationalism. He rejects secession as antithetical to the ""indivisible people"" formed by the Union, which follows from his premise but is substantively absurd. It's a line right out of the Joseph Story-Lincoln ""The United States as Unitary State"" textbook. (Abel P. Upshur authored a book-length refutation of Story's nationalist theory that's lamentably unknown for the most part. Upshur served as a high judge in Virginia and was Secretary of the Navy and then Secretary of State in the Tyler administration.) We need look only to the manner in which the Constitution was ratified to ascertain its inaccuracy. Article VII indicates its establishment derived from the approval of nine state conventions that would be binding ""between the States so ratifying the Same."" This is not how a nation-state is formed; this is how a federal union, i.e., an association of discrete political societies, is formed. Kesler's proposition would have more merit if ratification had hinged on a referendum-model binding on every state. But this wasn't the case, and James Madison (Virginia Plan consolidationist, bear in mind) accordingly noted in Federalist #39, ""In its foundation it [the Constitution] is federal, not national.""

Secession is thus constitutionally compatible and an example of political reflexivity: States that voluntarily join a union may withdraw on the same basis. (Would anyone deny the right of the United States to withdraw from the United Nations? Ok, bad question.) Specifically, secession is among ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States,"" and consequently a reserved power under the Tenth Amendment. Without that crucial, constitutionally protected exit option, encomiums to federalism are lip service.

Kesler's most troubling proposition, implicitly made, is that secession undermines the consent of the governed. It's quite Lincolnian and, when instantiated, calamitous (over 620,000 dead, countless more maimed, infrastructural devastation, etc.). The grisly falsity of this belief was most cogently pointed out by Lysander Spooner, whose abolitionist credentials preclude ad hominems often deployed by Lincoln apologists. (Spooner was a supporter of John Brown and wanted to kidnap Virginia Governor Henry Wise to obtain his release after Harpers Ferry.) Spooner had this to say in his magnificent No Treason: The Constitution of No Authority:

""Still another of the frauds of these men is, that they are now establishing, and that the war was destined to establish, u2018a government of consent.' The only idea they have ever manifested as to what is a government of consent, is this  that it is one to which everybody must consent, or be shot. This idea was the dominant one on which the war was carried on; and it is the dominant one, now that we have got what is called u2018peace.'""

The circumstances that impelled Spooner's comments warrant this vehemence. Kesler's contention that ""The original Republicans defended constitutional or limited government"" rings hollow in comparison.

As a Lincolnian, Kesler also celebrates related statism introduced during the administration: ""Original Republicans enacted laws stimulating railroad construction and manufacturers."" They embraced a modest federal role in education  directing resources to the states through the land-grant colleges  and supported increased local funding for primary and secondary schools."" Thomas DiLorenzo, Murray Rothbard, and Sheldon Richman have respectively addressed the corporate welfare, pedagogical nationalization, and general coercion promoted by these measures. (See Thomas DiLorenzo, ""The Feds versus the Indians,"" The Free Market, January 1998, Murray Rothbard, Education: Free and Compulsory, and Sheldon Richman, Separating School and State: How to Liberate America's Families.) No bona fide conservatism can countenance such radical policy.

As previously mentioned, Kesler is a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute, an entity afflicted with acute Lincolnitis. Its guru, Harry Jaffa, confers a secular deification upon Lincoln and has written, ""The Confederate States of America was a genteel anticipation, but an anticipation nonetheless, of the Third Reich."" (Claremont senior fellow Thomas G. West echoes the Nazi comparison in his otherwise fine study, Vindicating the Founders: Race, Sex, Class, and Justice in the Origins of America. I don't know if Kesler shares their parochial hyperbole.)

Kesler unwittingly indicates the course for Republicans to follow when he writes, ""The Republicans, of course, made mistakes. In Gov. Bush's words, ""the party of Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of Lincoln."" If the GOP is to be a viable party and not just a meager alternative to the (Social) Democrats, it needs to toss that mantle into the dustbin of history. I doubt it will, and just as the Republican Party arose as a challenger to the mainstream, we need to exercise political consumerism go shopping elsewhere.

Recently by Gary North: Liberty Is Winning, Mostly

A senior fellow at the Cato Institute has written a remarkable article. It implies that the Koch brothers, who are the main source of funding for Cato, are a pair of economic ignoramuses. (Note: ignorami is acceptable, if youre a pedant.) It was published in the Wall Street Journals December 14 online edition and in a special insert in the December 17 printed edition.

The insert asked: Should We End the Tax Deduction for Charitable Contributions? Dr. Daniel Mitchell, an economist, answered yes.

His argumentation is nothing if not unique. Let me take you through it.

For all the praise it gets, theres just no evidence that the tax break leads people to increase their givingbut it does lead them to make bad choices about giving. Whats more, it favors a segment of the public, the very wealthy, that can afford to give without a break. And cutting the deduction does a lot less economic harm than other ways of raising tax revenue.

Dr. Mitchell is a great believer in evidence. As we shall see, he cares not a fig for economic theory. Evidence is king.

Why do I say that he cares nothing for economic theory? Because he denies the fundamental premise of all free market economic theory: At a higher price, less is demanded.

He says that charitable giving remains at 2% of gross income, no matter what the policy. This is his evidence.

He relies on the undefined concept of need. This word is not used by free market economists. This is because they see behavior as modified at the margin. There are wants. Besides the basics of life, there are no needs.

Upper-income households are the biggest beneficiaries of the deduction, with those making more than $$100,000 per year taking 81% of the deduction even though they account for just 13.5% of all U.S. tax returns.

The data are even more skewed for households with more than $$200,000 of income. They account for fewer than 3% of all tax returns, yet they take 55% of all charitable deductions.

His argument is clear: marginal tax rates have no effect on giving. None.

Lets think about this claim. At a top bracket rate of 36%, for every dollar donated, Uncle Sam leaves 36 cents on the table. Mitchell says that it will not affect giving by adding 36% to the cost of giving by the rich.

In short, all modern economic theory is wrong. At 36% more costly, the same amount of charitable giving will occur.

Put differently, price is irrelevant to the rich. He is quite open about this.

These are people who can not only afford to give up the tax break, they would very likely give to charity without the deduction. They would still face tremendous cultural pressure to write charitable checks, as well as the prompting of their own conscience. Besides, many of them would still get nice perks for doing goodlike seats at the opera or buildings named after them.

To understand the logic of this argument, I offer this annual fund-raising letter from Cato to the Koch Brothers.

David and Charles Koch Somewhere, USA

Dear David and Charles:

Enclosed is a copy of a recent article by one of our fellows. It argues that rich people are economic ignoramuses. They do not respond to price changes. It states emphatically that if you and your peers have the tax deduction removed, you will still give as much money as before.

So, if the deduction is removed, as Dr. Mitchell recommends, we here at Cato expect that you will still send us as much money as you did before the deduction was removed.

Actually, we will need a bit more. Donors who are not fat cats like you will probably cut back on their giving. They respond to price changes. But you two wont. Dr. Mitchell has the evidence. You dont want to argue with evidence. Thats what scientific economics is all about. We here at Cato are nothing if not scientific.

Just to show that we are confident that you will still send as much money as before, we are tossing in some opera tickets.

Sincerely yours, The Cato Fund-Raising Staff

I would like to see the Kochs response.

Introduction

Constitutions historically ground states legally. They enshrine politics at the heart of a society (politics being defined here as aggressive not defensive power). Today, modern constitutions all over the settled world continue to give politics a stronger position in every society than they have ever had before. If politics fundamentally act to disable the proper and beneficial working and progress of society, as I and many others believe and have argued, then we need to examine the constitutionalism that introduces and supports this politics. This article has that purpose. I will provide four theorems of politics to show where such a constitutional grounding must logically lead.

The anti-federalists opposed the Constitution of 1788, while the federalists supported it. They made opposing arguments based on opposing theories, and these arguments are preserved for us in the Federalist Papers and the Anti-Federalist Papers. The questions they debated are questions of politics, that is, power relations. And the dynamics of power relations as they work out in practice are complex. Establishing a power structure puts a theory into action. Evaluating the theory makes the welter of observed political detail intelligible. As time passes, we observe how the theory is working itself out. In some cases, it takes only a few years to work out (as in France after Napoleon, Germany after 1918 and again after 1933, or as in Iraq today) and in other cases it takes longer (as in Russia after 1917) or very much longer (as in Rome after 44 B.C.).

In addition to theory, we have experience. Lincoln in 1861 said ""Our popular government has often been called an experiment."" Experimental outcomes relate to theories. We have the benefit of 220 years of subsequent U.S. experience to help us judge the competing political theories in these early documents. And why should we evaluate them? Because we continually choose our method of government and that choice influences our lives for good or evil.

National state versus states and individuals

The theory of government written into our original Constitution has surely contributed to our present form of government. It is not the only contributor. New theories have been devised and implemented outside of the Constitution, and the Constitution has been amended. Yet these dynamics took place under allegiance to this same document. To what extent are the obvious evils of our present government traceable to the Constitution and the establishment of our national government?

In Anti-Federalist Paper #3 (AF #3), ""A Farmer"" (thought to be John Francis Mercer, a non-signing member of the Constitutional Convention), distinguished national from federal government. National government ""operates on individuals."" Federal government binds states into a league or confederacy (which is why some anti-federalists at that time called themselves federalists). Today the distinction between national and federal has been lost. But the substance of the distinction he made is of great political importance. Since the powers of the Constitution operated on individuals, its government is national. Indeed, AF #1 (written by ""A Federalist"") called the proposed state an empire: ""I had rather be a free citizen of the small republic of Massachusetts, than an oppressed subject of the great American empire.""

The anti-federalists accurately saw the new power relations embodied in the proposed Constitution. The Congress could lay taxes upon individuals. This meant national taxes. It could call forth the militia, arm them, train them, and use them. This meant national armed forces. It could provide and maintain a national navy. It could declare war. It could regulate the commerce with foreign nations and among the several states. This power did not touch individuals directly, but Congress also had power ""To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers…"" It would be found necessary and proper to regulate the commerce of individuals in order to regulate that of the states. This meant the national regulation of commerce. Since almost everything relates to commerce, Congress could regulate everything. Moreover, Congress was empowered to ""provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States…"" The ""general welfare"" could mean practically anything the national government said it was. When combined with the ""necessary and proper"" clause, the scope for passing laws became almost unlimited.

The limitations placed upon the national government rested upon power relations (a) within the government itself, (b) with the people of the United States, and (c) with the individual states. Sophisticated theory is not required to predict the outcome of some of these power relations. The executive branch of government, being a smaller and more united organization and being given powers to act and command, would eventually take precedence over the Legislature. This would happen despite the power of the Legislature to tax. In a way, the process of power accumulation of the presidency would be analogous to how kings accumulated power from nobles. A president divides and conquers, playing off one legislator against another, because he has the final power to sign a bill or not sign it. He is able to originate programs and appeal to the public over the heads of Congress. He is united and speaks with a single voice that is heard by all, while Congressmen appear as a divided, subordinate, and contentious lot. He can simply issue executive orders, and what can Congress do? The impeachment power is rarely used because it threatens the power of the whole government and can only bring the Vice-President into power. Used too often, Congress will be accused of subverting the people’s will. If an impeachment fails, Congress will be weakened for years afterwards. All of this suggests that the Executive would come out the winner. It would gain power over the other branches of government.

In the contest between the national government and the people that the Constitution established, there could be only one outcome: the ascendant power of the national state. The Constitution bestowed monopoly powers on the national government. The powers to tax and regulate can destroy almost any opposition in society. The people never had a chance. They were licked right from the start.

It took the War Between the States to settle the winner of the contest between the states and the national government. Mercer foresaw this titanic struggle: ""In a national government, unless cautiously and fortunately administered, the disputes will be the deep-rooted differences of interest, where part of the empire must be injured by the operation of general law; and then should the sword of government be once drawn (which Heaven avert) I fear it will not be sheathed, until we have waded through that series of desolation, which France, Spain, and the other great kingdoms of the world have suffered, in order to bring so many separate States into uniformity, of government and law; in which event the legislative power can only be entrusted to one man (as it is with them) who can have no local attachments, partial interests, or private views to gratify.""

Politics versus self-government

The Constitution instituted national politics and a strong national government. It elevated politics to a higher and more potent status. The original Constitutional sin, I will argue, is the politics itself that Constitutions introduce. I remind the reader that politics here is defined as aggressive or coercive power relations, not power used in defense of natural rights.

Mercer in AF #3 clearly posed the two main alternatives: ""If the body of the people will not govern themselves, and govern themselves well too, the consequence is unavoidable — a FEW will, and must govern them. Then it is that government becomes truly a government by force only, where men relinquish part of their natural rights to secure the rest, instead of an union of will and force, to protect all their natural rights, which ought to be the foundation of every rightful social compact.""

We will have either self-government to protect natural rights using justly applied force (defensive force) or a government ""by force only,"" that is, a government of unabashed coercion and violence. This is the kind of government that we today have.

After 1788, the future power relations would take years to work out, but they were embedded in the theory of government that the Constitution advocated. I do not refer to the specifics of government that were proposed in that document. I refer to the assumption or implicit theory of the document that politics or power relations should be adopted front and center by Americans or that politics are necessary. The state is evil, but is it a necessary evil as the Constitution’s supporters claimed? Mercer and other anti-federalists said ""No."" In that tradition, market anarchists say ""No.""

The theory embodied by the Constitution with its panoply of powers was not self-government. It was not restricted to enforcement of natural rights. It was a central state, complicated to be sure, but a central state nonetheless, and a central state over individuals. The American Constitutional experiment was not and never has been an experiment in self-government. It was an experiment in national government. It was an experiment to see who would dominate the power relations: the people, the individual states, or the national government.

Four theorems

Let us now work out the theory of political relations as embodied in politics. The goal is to make the complexities of history intelligible. When we see where we have come to, why we have come to this point, and where we are headed, then each of us will be in a better position to judge where and how to go next.

Power relations necessarily do four things. First, given that there are politics, it follows that there will be exercises of power in which some individuals will gain while others lose. This almost is a defining trait of politics. It happens because power gives some persons the ability to obtain goods from others without their permission and without a voluntary exchange being concluded. Since goods are desirable at costs below their values, politics creates and then encourages stealing. Politics involves getting and using power, and power leads to taking. Politics is the opposite of a process of free exchange in which both sides gain. I’ve previously put it this way: ""Rulers are like anyone else. They think in terms of loss and gain. Self-preservation or security is prevention of loss. More power and wealth are gains. Rulers, being men of power, think and act in terms of force and taking."" Similarly, de Jasay says ""All nonunanimous politics — and unanimous politics would of course be redundant, and an oxymoron — is redistributive."" Politics is all about taking from some and giving to others (including the rulers). Theorem one is this: Politics leads to theft. Having aggressive power is but one short step from using it, so that we may also say: Politics is theft.

Second, which is a consequence of the ability to gain via the power relations (by politics), is this theorem. Those who have power seek more power. Theorem two: Politics nurtures the growth of power. Once a power center is created, like a national state, that state will attempt to increase its power. Power is a good, both in itself and because it can be used to obtain other goods. Men in power have already shown they desire power, so we predict they will seek more. Our only assumption in reaching this conclusion is that their tastes for power do not diminish while in office. Naturally, this will depend on the individual’s preferences as well as the costs and benefits they perceive of seeking more power. But since a state is an organization peopled by a number of men, all of whom have shown a thirst for power, we can be very sure that the organization will seek more power even if an occasional individual has a change of heart. The odds of changing the minds of 30 men or a majority of them are far lower than the odds of one man changing. Hence, our assumption that tastes for power do not diminish while in office is a very weak assumption. And if we follow Lord Acton, we can assert the opposite, that power corrupts and will increase the taste for power.

The moment that a society takes politics for granted, condones it, and allows it, a competition for that power and its extension arises. To reach this conclusion, we need only the very weak assumption that a number of individuals or groups want power. Since power is a good and since there is a demand for more power, there will no doubt arise competition for power. This is the third consequence of politics and another theorem: Politics begets competition for power.

The outcome of such a competition can be a balance of powers. But such an outcome can be only temporary, because the individual power-seekers will constantly be on the lookout for any advantage that will place them in a dominant position. Hence, we arrive at a fourth theorem: Politics nurtures centralization of power. Politics motivates attempts to centralize power in as few hands as possible. Within the United States, the drive is toward the national government ruling the 50 states and all individuals within them. Within the government, the drive is toward the President ruling the other branches of government. Within the world, the drive is toward one state ruling all other states. Within the world, the drive is toward one government ruling every person in the world. In the limit, the drive is toward one man having power over every other man. At times, we have seen dictators with tremendous power. We have a presidency that has such centralized power. Each president has enough nuclear weapons at his disposal to destroy vast stretches of the earth and mankind. In this sense, the president ""owns"" us; he owns our lives or at least has an option on them.

I restate the four theorems in one place for convenience:

Politics leads to theft. Politics is theft. Politics nurtures the growth of power. Politics begets competition for power. Politics nurtures centralization of power.

In a way, these propositions are so basic and acceptable that they seem trivial. Yet they are also far-reaching, of great importance, not widely appreciated, and perhaps easily forgotten. They show to where the introduction of politics into a society leads. According to Robert Yates, experience supports these ideas. After deriving them, I find that Yates (“Brutus”), the anti-federalist who subsequently published the Secret Proceedings and Debates of the Constitutional Convention, 1787, wrote in the AF #17: “Besides, it is a truth confirmed by the unerring experience of ages, that every man, and every body of men, invested with power, are ever disposed to increase it, and to acquire a superiority over everything that stands in their way. This disposition, which is implanted in human nature, will operate in the Federal legislature to lessen and ultimately to subvert the State authority, and having such advantages, will most certainly succeed, if the Federal government succeeds at all.” Far more eloquently than I have, he affirmed the truth of statements 2—4.

Conclusions

Taken to the logical limit, politics produces a society with one man ruling over everyone else. This is not usually seen, but there is plenty of evidence that societies have come quite close. There are plenty of regimes striving in this direction. I do not exclude the U.S. The dynamics of power necessarily push in this direction. The remedy is to disable the state and the constitution that is its heart. Politics is clearly a poison that, in large enough doses, kills the patient. Not only that, it kills patients in other societies through warfare.

In smaller doses, politics sickens and disables the patient. The patients today are many sick societies throughout the world that feature many individuals whose progress and well-being are being stymied by the poisonous constitutional institutions and states in their midst. The remedy is more self-government, the more the better. However, since politics nurtures the growth of power and competition for that power, no society can stand still. It either must aim for complete self-government, or else it will find that it is headed toward domination of society by state.

There are those who believe that the state, in a small and controlled dose, benefits the patient as some poisons do. This position is contradictory, however. There cannot simultaneously be control and non-control. A state has a monopoly of power, which means it has control. The society and the individuals in society do not have control. And once a state is created, then the four theorems come into play. The dynamics of power play out as a tendency to an increase in the state’s powers, checked only by the costs of exercising excessive state power that show up via resistance, rebellion, non-compliance, sabotage, boycott, strike, and revolution, etc.

Little of what I have said above has an ethical or moral content. My goal was to present a theory of politics that holds regardless of one’s political views. There may be those who believe that empire is a good thing or that suppressing individuals is a good thing. They may prefer politics as the vehicle to accrete power. They may prefer constitutions and states.

My view, expressed many times before, is that politics is evil. Aristotle has written that ""Man is by nature a political animal."" Man can and does choose evil. He does steal. He does steal and kill through politics. Man does habitually use politics, as Aristotle avers. This in no way conflicts with the statement that politics is evil. It in no way conflicts with the view that we will be better off if we aim instead for self-government. I do not interpret either Aristotle’s statement or man’s nature as a cause for either undue optimism or pessimism. Fatalism does not follow from observing man as he is and will be. The short course of recorded history reveals that man has on numerous occasions managed his affairs beneficially without constitutions and states, and without setting off a dynamic that leads to permanently enslaving a large portion of mankind. Moreover, self-government is now and always has been the rule in the major spaces left unattended by the national state. I conclude that we have a choice. We always have a choice. Mercer stated it in 1788: ""If the body of the people will not govern themselves, and govern themselves well too, the consequence is unavoidable — a FEW will, and must govern them.""

170053,"The Curse of Machinery

And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words (Exodus 5:6-9).

Three issues were involved here: theological, judicial, and economic. Theologically, it was this question: “Who is God: the gods of Egypt or the God of Moses?” Judicially, it was this question: “Who represented God in history, Pharaoh or Moses?” Economically, it was this question: “Does a decrease in the division of labor make men poorer?”

According to the polytheistic theology of Egypt, Pharaoh was a god. He was the primary link between the realm of the gods and mankind. The Egyptian state was therefore divine. Pharaoh was the pinnacle at the top of this pyramid of earthly power. Moses was calling this theology into question. Pharaoh recognized this. “And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go” (v. 2).

Moses at this point in the confrontation was not calling for the exodus. He was demanding — not asking — that the Hebrews be permitted to journey three days from their compulsory work center, participate in a covenantal feast, and then return. Pharaoh recognized that this was an attack on his divinity and therefore also on the legitimacy of the Egyptian state. This would be a festival of liberation. He refused to let them go. This was the beginning of the public confrontation between two cultures. One was thoroughly statist. The other was not.

Pharaoh imposed negative sanctions on the Hebrews, but not on Moses. He sought to undermine Moses in the eyes of the people. The punishment was economic: Pharaoh’s refusal to supply the Hebrew slaves with straw. Straw was a necessary ingredient in bricks. This new rule forced onto the slaves an additional task: gathering straw. This decreased the division of labor. It increased the costs of production. It therefore increased the workload on the slaves. That was the goal of the decree. Pharaoh understood basic economics.

What if some inventor after this declaration had come up with a way to increase the output of straw gatherers? What if he invented a reaper that cut down the straw faster? Would this piece of machinery have increased the division of labor for the Hebrews? Of course. Would this have decreased the slaves’ workload? Of course. Would this have been a benefit to the slaves? Of course. Would Pharaoh have outlawed the Hebrews’ use of this invention? Of course.

A problem that we face today is this: modern politicians imitate Pharaoh. They adopt a comparable policy of restricting the introduction of tools that increase the division of labor and thereby increase the productivity of workers. They do so for the same reason that Pharaoh did: to increase the amount of labor necessary to complete required tasks. What is different is this: they justify this as a humanitarian measure. Pharaoh knew better. He was a far better economist than the typical politician is today.

Let us consider the economics of the hatred of labor-saving machinery.

1. Owner

Who are the owners, and what do they own?

There are multiple owners: an inventor with an idea, a customer with money to spend, a capitalist with money to invest, a businessman with organizational abilities and also an assessment of the economic future, an owner of raw materials or land, and a worker with labor to sell. Each of them is legally sovereign over whatever asset he owns. He possesses the legal right to exclude others — the essence of ownership. Each of them wants to benefit from his property. Each of them needs the cooperation of the others. They have the potential for increasing their wealth through cooperation.

They all benefit from a private property legal order. This means that the free market itself is an economic asset. The legal rights of property are assets. But these assets are legally different from the other forms of property. They cannot be bought and sold on an open market.

Consider workers, since the loss of jobs is the focus of the resentment against machinery. Workers own the right to rent their labor services. Some new technique of production may or may not lead to greater income for all of them. If they become skilled in using the new machine, they will benefit from rising wages. But they may be dismissed from employment if the cost of the marginal output of the machine costs less than hiring a particular laborer. The machine in no way interferes with the legal right of workers to make bids to employers. They do not own their jobs; they own only the right to make a bid for a job. Nobody owns a job. A job is the outcome of successful mutual bids: employers vs. employers, and workers vs. workers.

Workers are not the only owners involved in the introduction of new machinery. All owners may be affected. But the legal and moral issue at hand is the right of all owners to make bids.

2. Window

The business owner, the inventor of the new machine, the resource owner, the capital owner, and the worker all act as economic agents of future customers. The customers retain authority, because they possess the most marketable commodity: money. Their decisions in the future will determine which businesses, which inventors, and which workers were correct in assessing the future demand of customers.

The system of economic sanctions in a free market economy mandates that producers serve the demands of customers. So, from the point of view of customers, it is irrelevant whether a machine or a human being has produced what they want to buy. The customers want the best possible deal. If the introduction of machinery leads to a decrease in employment for certain workers, customers are probably unaware of it, and even if they are aware of it, most of them do not care. What they care about is themselves. In this respect, they are no different from the businessman who decides to buy the labor-saving machine, the inventor who sells the machine, and the workers who will use the machines in order to increase their personal output and thereby keep their jobs.

If the labor-saving machine or process decreases the cost of labor for business, then in all likelihood the businessman will decide to increase total output, in order to sell this output to a greater number of customers. In order to sell to more customers, the business will have to lower the prices of the final products. This is a benefit for customers, although it will not be a benefit to rival businesses, rival workers, and rival sellers of machinery. But the free market system is not structured so as to benefit producers at the expense of customers; it is an outcome of a private property system which inherently benefits customers. Customers shout: “May the best man win — as determined by us.”

3. Stone

The stone is thrown at machines. Politicians do this in the name of protecting existing jobs. The politicians ignore customers. They ignore future jobs. These are things not seen by politicians. “Workers own jobs!” But they do not.

224171,"What is Vitamin E?

Vitamin E is an important fat-soluble antioxidant compound that aids the body in neutralizing the harmful after-effects of oxidation of fats. Current research is even looking into the important role that this vitamin plays in stopping free-radical production, a key method of preventing the development of chronic diseases and ageing. It is also a vital element in the overall maintenance of a healthy immune system.

Some studies are even looking into its role in preventing degenerative mental imbalances such as dementia and Alzheimers disease. And while many of us may do well in taking extra vitamin E supplements, we can use an organic diet to get a large amount of the daily requirements for this powerful antioxidant lipid. In fact, there are many common foods with vitamin E. You probably have a few in your house right now.

Foods With Vitamin E

Here are fifteen foods with vitamin E that you should strongly consider adding to your diet.

1. Almonds

Almonds are one the best vitamin E foods. Just an ounce of almonds offers a whopping 7.4 milligrams of vitamin E. You can also get your vitamin E needs in the form of almond milk and almond oils. We would recommend eating raw almonds, if possible.

2. Raw Seeds

Select raw seeds, such as sunflower, pumpkin and sesame, are another common food with vitamin E. In fact, eating just ¼ of a cup of sunflower seeds gives you 90.5% of your recommended daily value.

3. Swiss Chard

Swiss chard is easily one of the healthiest vegetables you can eat on a daily basis. Commonly known to be high in vitamin K, vitamin A and vitamin C, swiss chard is another food high in vitamin E. Just one cup of boiled swiss chard greens will provide you with almost 17% of your daily recommended values.

4. Mustard Greens

Similar to swiss chard, mustard greens are very nutrient dense that can provide alot of health benefits. Not only are they one of the best vitamin E foods, but mustard greens are also high in vitamin K, vitamin A, folate, and vitamin c. Eating just one cup of boiled mustard greens contains about 14% of your daily dietary requirements.

5. Spinach

Spinach may not be your favorite veggie, but it is one of the best leafy greens you can add to your diet. Not only is it one of the best calcium foods and naturally high in folate, its also one of the best vitamin E foods as well. Just one cup of boiled spinach will provide you with approximately 20% of your daily needs. Try adding fresh spinach to your sandwiches to make them extra healthy.

6. Turnip Greens

While turnip greens may have a slightly bitter taste, they are very high in many essential nutrients. Like the rest of the leafy greens on this list, just one cup will provide you with plenty of vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin C and folate. Not to mention approximately 12% of your daily requirements of vitamin E.

7. Kale

Kale is another great cruciferous vegetable you should add to your diet. They are high in many nutrients, and just one cup of boiled kale can give you almost 6% of your daily vitamin E requirements.

8. Plant oils

Most plant seed oils are very good sources for Vitamin E as well. The best oil with vitamin E is Wheat germ oil. In fact, one tablespoon of this oil holds 100% of your daily Vitamin E requirements. Sunflower oil is another excellent option, as it provides over 5 mg of the vitamin, and can easily be be used for cooking. Other great Vitamin-E-rich oils include hempseed oil, coconut oil, cottonseed oil (with almost 5 mg of vitamin E), olive oil, and safflower oil. We would recommend only buying oils that are cold pressed unrefined and organic.

Have yourself a merry little depression

Whats this? Christine Lagarde, IMF chief, said last week that the worlds nations needed to work together to avoid a 1930s-style depression.

But seeing the way they work together and where they seem to be headed wed prefer a depression.

The idea of the worlds authorities is not to solve the debt problem, but to make it larger. One bank goes bust; they get a bigger bank  a central bank  to bail it out. One country goes broke; they get a bigger country to bail it out.

The US bailed out its financial sector. Europe has had trouble getting together to bail out its fringe nations. But gradually, in fits and starts, the pieces are coming together. We will all bail each other out. Then, we will all be bailed out. Together.

We need to act as collectively as possible, says Lagarde.

She means that we all have to accept more debt in order to prevent depression. That is, all the feds horses and all the feds men are supposed to make sure that 1) stock holders dont lose money 2) bankers dont go broke 3) speculators dont get wiped out 4) business executives dont lose their jobs Daily Reckoning readers will note, with a wry smile, that these are precisely the things that OUGHT to happen.

Which also happens to be what a depression would accomplish Its why we have depressions and why we need them. They dont have to be long, drawn-out disasters. They can be short and sweet. But they have to get the job done.

On the other hand, let us look at what all this collective, depression-preventing action is accomplishing. In a word or two, it is protecting the insiders at the expense of the outsiders. That is, it is doing what government always does. But it is doing it in a particularly galling way. Heres the latest on what the insiders are up to, from the Guardian:

Revealed: huge increase in executive pay for Americas top bosses Exclusive survey shows Americas CEOs enjoyed pay hikes of up to 40% last year  with one chief executive earning $$145m

Chief executive pay has roared back after two years of stagnation and decline. Americas top bosses enjoyed pay hikes of between 27 and 40% last year, according to the largest survey of US CEO pay. The dramatic bounceback comes as the latest government figures show wages for the majority of Americans are failing to keep up with inflation.

Americas highest paid executive took home more than $$145.2m, and as stock prices recovered across the board, the median value of bosses profits on stock options rose 70% in 2010, from $$950,400 to $$1.3m. The news comes against the backdrop of an Occupy Wall Street movement that has focused Washingtons attention on the pay packages of Americas highest paid.

Three of this years top 10 earners come from the healthcare industry. Top earner John Hammergren at McKesson, the worlds largest healthcare firm, made $$145,266,91 last year  most of it from stock options.

2010 was a great year to lose your job as a CEO. Four of the 10 highest paid CEOs were retired or departing executives. Ronald Williams, former head of Aetna, a health insurer, exercised 2.4m options for a profit of $$50.4m. Aetnas stock price declined by 70% from when Williams assumed the role of CEO in February 2006 until his retirement. At pharmacy chain CVS, Thomas Ryan made a $$28m profit on his options. During Ryans 13-year tenure as CEO, CVS Caremarks stock price decreased almost 54%.

Omnicares Joel Gemunder retired last August and received cash severance of $$16m, part of a final-year pay package worth $$98.28m.

Interesting, no? Many of the top earners are in the zombie health care industry. It is a zombie industry because it is so heavily controlled, subsidized, and protected from competition by the zombie government.

In our way of seeing things, no CEO is worth $$145 million. Or even $$1 million, for that matter. But thats what you get in a degenerate pseudo-capitalist system.

Meanwhile, the average working man  who has no clue about the whys of it  is getting pretty chuffed.

$$740 billion pay gap threat to US recovery says The Financial Times. That amount is the money that would have gone to US working people if they had maintained their share of national income at post-war average.

The FT is scratching its head, trying to figure out how the economy can recover when the people who do the buying have so little money. According to its figures, the average worker would have $$5,000 more this year alone, if wages were still at 63% of national income. Instead, they have sunk to only 58% of national income with more going to the bosses and stockholders.

For his part, the working stiff is less concerned with what it means to the economy and more concerned with what it means to him:

Like a lot of Americans, Im pretty ticked off, said an Occupy Wall Street protestor. Its not that there are rich people. Its that the people with a lot of money over the past few decades have rigged the system so that theres not a fair chance to anyone anymore.

Hes right. The system is rigged. Probably not the way he thinks. But rigged nonetheless.

The feds rigged it. They turned Americas leading business sectors into zombie-controlled, value-destroying industries. They turned the nations money into an ersatz currency. And they pushed the countrys middle class households in debt holes they find it difficult to climb out of .

And then, when the whole degenerate system was ready to come crashing down they bailed out the debt-mongers and propped up the whole corrupt system with $$29 trillion in money that didnt belong to them.

A merry little depression would have been so much better.

Poor America  writes a French friend. Its not the land of the free anymore. Now, its the land of slaves.

The FATCA law (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) will force banks across the globe to collaborate with the IRS. An explanation of the huge repercussions this legal precedent will have on banks and banking clients.

Once FATCA  Foreign Accounts Tax Compliance Act  is enacted on January 1, 2013, banks worldwide will find themselves subject to the American tax administration bureau known as the IRS (Internal Revenue Service). Adopted in March, 2010, FATCA is a facet of the broader Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act which is designed to promote employment opportunities in the United States. In order to finance the HIRE Act, fighting tax evasion is even more in the spotlight than it has been in the past and Washington wants to use its political clout to get its message across this time. What this really means is that foreign banks  or FFIs (Foreign Financial Institutions)  will be obliged to conform to a long series of procedures designed to identify US Persons (US citizens & Green Card holders) subject to American taxes. This naturally concerns American citizens but likewise extends to American nationals foreign spouses. However, the long arm of the US administration will even be going so far as to include foreigners residing outside American borders, some of whom may have never even set foot on US soil. This is due to the fact that non-American banks will be obligated to report portfolios which include American assets even if they belong to foreigners with no ties to the US.

We used to be so happy when we got to the US, said another European. We felt we could breathe more freely. The country was so big so prosperous and so open.

That was what I remember from about 20 years ago. But now it is quite different. I dread coming to the US. We came through US customs in Atlanta a few weeks ago. My wife had a half-eaten sandwich in her bag which she had forgotten about. They put us in a special room and treated us like we were criminals. It was ridiculous and humiliating.

But theres always something. Someone is always yelling at you. Everything is illegal or forbidden. It just doesnt seem like the same country it was a few years ago. So, we only come here when we have to for business reasons.

*** There goes the republic, says an article at Truthdig, by Robert Scheer.

The defense authorization bill that Congress passed and President Obama had threatened to veto will soon become law, a fact that should be met with public outrage. Human Rights Watch Executive Director Kenneth Roth, responding to Obamas craven collapse on the bills most controversial provision, said, By signing this defense spending bill, President Obama will go down in history as the president who enshrined indefinite detention without trial in US law. On Wednesday, White House press secretary Jay Carney claimed the most recent changes give the president additional discretion in determining how the law will be implemented, consistent with our values and the rule of law, which are at the heart of our countrys strength.

What rubbish, coming from a president who taught constitutional law Sadly, this flagrant subversion of the constitutionally guaranteed right to due process of law was opposed in the Senate by only seven senators, including libertarian Republican Rand Paul and progressive Independent Bernie Sanders.

Dear Editor:

Our membership has deep contempt for police at every level of government, particularly those who investigate homicides. This group of bozos are at the bottom-of-the-barrel, the least intelligent, most corrupt and laziest law enforcement agents of all.

Actually, our 4100 dues paying members survive and flourish because of police ineptitude. Amused, we watch the clumsy manner in which most murder case investigations are handled. Even more ludicrous are the transparent efforts to cover-up shoddy work.

For too long, we have lived with the ""Dr. Richard Kimble"" defense murder strategy. Predictably, the police and defense lawyers, in lockstep, have picked up this absurd premise. It matters not how the murder was accomplished, or who the victim was. Every murderer shouts:

""It was a one-armed man who did it.""

Those unfortunate souls who have lost an arm to disease, have had it severed in an accident (shark bite), or war; even those cheated of an arm by nature, found themselves in constant danger.

It wasn’t only people who looked like David Janssen, and years later, Harrison Ford, who were beating them up and dragging them into police stations. The fact that they could only ""half"" fight back made the one-armed fellow an easy victim.

It wasn’t until the failure of a tv remake of ""The Fugitive"" that the ""Richard Kimble"" defense fell out of favor.

Without the ""one-armed man"" defense, the police continued to stumble along as usual, doggedly pursuing the wrong people and letting obvious murderers go free.

We at the National Association of Serial Killers are accustomed to this inefficiency, but some current developments greatly trouble our membership.

In a recent case in Massachusetts, a well known allergist, as guilty as he was splattered by his murdered wife’s blood, showcased the new defense:

""A serial killer did it"".

The Washington, D.C. police blundering along in the Chandra Levy missing intern case are all set to pick up the mantra:

""It was a serial killer who did it.""

In a cabal, which includes murderers, their lawyers and the police, we detect a dangerous trend. Every murderer will soon be pointing to the hapless serial killer.

We are outraged by this new development.

Our members, the authentic serial killers, resent being identified with these run-of-the-mill murder cases.

The true serial killer should not be confused with amateurs.

The serial killer is meticulous and rarely gets caught.

Serial killers almost never murder friends or family.

Serial killers often plant clues to help the inept police (to make the chase more exciting.)

Unlike their mundane, passion-driven counterparts, the serial killer is generally erudite and literate.

Mr. Editor, we implore you, please don’t get caught up with this new tactic on the part of the police establishment to cover-up their own inadequacies by blaming members of our association.

Stop scapegoating. Stop maligning us. Don’t sully the great history of serial killers.

The Association of One-Armed Americans join in this protest.

Sincerely yours, Hannibal ""the Ripper"" Bundy (Be advised, this is not my real name) Executive Director The National Association of Serial Killers

Please remember this warning when you go to the ATM to get cash… and there is none.

While we were thinking about what was really going on with today’s strange new money system, a startling thought occurred to us.

Our financial system could take a surprising and catastrophic twist that almost nobody imagines, let alone anticipates.

Do you remember when a lethal tsunami hit the beaches of Southeast Asia, killing thousands of people and causing billions of dollars of damage? Tower of Basel: The Sh... Adam LeBor Best Price: $4.67 Buy New $5.46 (as of 06:40 EST - Details)

Well, just before the 80-foot wall of water slammed into the coast an odd thing happened: The water disappeared.

The tide went out farther than anyone had ever seen before. Local fishermen headed for high ground immediately. They knew what it meant. But the tourists went out onto the beach looking for shells!

The same thing could happen to the money supply…

There’s Not Enough Physical Money

Here’s how… and why:

It’s almost seems impossible. Hard to imagine. Difficult to understand. But if you look at M2 money supply – which measures coins and notes in circulation as well as bank deposits and money market accounts – America’s money stock amounted to $11.7 trillion as of last month.

Flash Boys Michael Lewis Best Price: $1.60 Buy New $0.92 (as of 12:45 EST - Details) But there was just $1.3 trillion of physical currency in circulation – about only half of which is in the US. (Nobody knows for sure.)

What we use as money today is mostly credit. It exists as zeros and ones in electronic bank accounts. We never see it. Touch it. Feel it. Count it out. Or lose it behind seat cushions.

Banks profit – handsomely – by creating this credit. And as long as banks have sufficient capital, they are happy to create as much credit as we are willing to pay for.

After all, it costs the banks almost nothing to create new credit. That’s why we have so much of it.

A monetary system like this has never before existed. And this one has existed only during a time when credit was undergoing an epic expansion.

So our monetary system has never been thoroughly tested. How will it hold up in a deep or prolonged credit contraction? Can it survive an extended bear market in bonds or stocks? What would happen if consumer prices were out of control?

Less Than Zero

Our current money system began in 1971. Dark Pools: The Rise o... Scott Patterson Best Price: $6.89 Buy New $10.65 (as of 11:05 EST - Details)

It survived consumer price inflation of almost 14% a year in 1980. But Paul Volcker was already on the job, raising interest rates to bring inflation under control.

And it survived the “credit crunch” of 2008-09. Ben Bernanke dropped the price of credit to almost zero, by slashing short-term interest rates and buying trillions of dollars of government bonds.

But the next crisis could be very different…

Short-term interest rates are already close to zero in the U.S. (and less than zero in Switzerland, Denmark, and Sweden). And according to a recent study by McKinsey, the world’s total debt (at least as officially recorded) now stands at $200 trillion – up $57 trillion since 2007. That’s 286% of global GDP… and far in excess of what the real economy can support.

At some point, a debt correction is inevitable. Debt expansions are always – always – followed by debt contractions. There is no other way. Debt cannot increase forever.

Broken Markets: How Hi... Sal L. Arnuk, Joseph C... Best Price: $11.36 Buy New $30.96 (as of 08:45 EST - Details) And when it happens, ZIRP and QE will not be enough to reverse the process, because they are already running at open throttle.

What then?

The value of debt drops sharply and fast. Creditors look to their borrowers… traders look at their counterparties… bankers look at each other…

…and suddenly, no one wants to part with a penny, for fear he may never see it again. Credit stops.

It’s not just that no one wants to lend; no one wants to borrow either – except for desperate people with no choice, usually those who have no hope of paying their debts.

Just as we saw after the 2008 crisis, we can expect a quick response from the feds.

The Fed will announce unlimited new borrowing facilities. But it won’t matter….

House prices will be crashing. (Who will lend against the value of a house?) Stock prices will be crashing. (Who will be able to borrow against his stocks?) Art, collectibles, and resources – all we be in free fall.

The NEXT Crisis The Secret Club That R... Kate Kelly Best Price: $2.64 Buy New $12.66 (as of 06:15 EST - Details)

In the last crisis, every major bank and investment firm on Wall Street would have gone broke had the feds not intervened. Next time it may not be so easy to save them.

The next crisis is likely to be across ALL asset classes. And with $57 trillion more in global debt than in 2007, it is likely to be much harder to stop.

Are you with us so far?

Because here is where it gets interesting…

In a gold-backed monetary system prices fall. But the money is still there. Money becomes more valuable. It doesn’t disappear. It is more valuable because you can use it to buy more stuff.

Naturally, people hold on to it. Of course, the velocity of money – the frequency at which each unit of currency is used to buy something – falls. And this makes it appear that the supply of money is falling too.

But imagine what happens to credit money. The money doesn’t just stop circulating. It vanishes. As collateral goes bad, credit is destroyed.

A bank that had an “asset” (in the form of a loan to a customer) of $100,000 in June may have zilch by July. A corporation that splurged on share buybacks one week could find those shares cut in half two weeks later. A person Against the State: An ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr. Best Price: $10.76 Buy New $9.95 (as of 04:30 EST - Details) with a $100,000 stock market portfolio one day could find his portfolio has no value at all a few days later.

All of this is standard fare for a credit crisis. The new wrinkle – a devastating one – is that people now do what they always do, but they are forced to do it in a radically different way.

They stop spending. They hoard cash. But what cash do you hoard when most transactions are done on credit? Do you hoard a line of credit? Do you put your credit card in your vault?

No. People will hoard the kind of cash they understand… something they can put their hands on… something that is gaining value – rapidly. They’ll want dollar bills.

Also, following a well-known pattern, these paper dollars will quickly disappear. People drain cash machines. They drain credit facilities. They ask for “cash back” when they use their credit cards. They want real money – old-fashioned money that they can put in their pockets and their home safes…

Dollar Panic

Let us stop here and remind readers that we’re talking about a short time frame – days… maybe weeks… a couple of months at most. That’s all. It’s the period after the credit crisis has sucked the cash out of the system… and before the government’s inflation tsunami has hit.

As Ben Bernanke put it, “a determined central bank can always create positive consumer price inflation.” But it takes time!

And during that interval, panic will set in. A dollar panic – with people desperate to put their hands on dollars… to pay for food… for fuel…and for everything else they need.

Credit may still be available. But it will be useless. No one will want it. ATMs and banks will run out of cash. Credit facilities will be drained of real cash. Banks will put up signs, first: “Cash withdrawals limited to $500.” And then: “No Cash Withdrawals.”

You will have a credit card with a $10,000 line of credit. You have $5,000 in your debit account. But all financial institutions are staggering. And in the news you will read that your bank has defaulted and been placed in receivership. What would you rather have? Your $10,000 line of credit or a stack of $50 bills?

You will go to buy gasoline. You will take out your credit card to pay.

“Cash Only,” the sign will say. Because the machinery of the credit economy will be breaking down. The gas station… its suppliers… and its financiers do not want to get stuck with a “credit” from your bankrupt lender!

Whose credit cards are still good? Whose lines of credit are still valuable? Whose bank is ready to fail? Who can pay his mortgage? Who will honor his credit card debt? In a crisis, those questions will be as common as “Who will win an Oscar?” today.

But no one will know the answers. Quickly, they will stop guessing… and turn to cash.

Our advice: Keep some on hand. You may need it.

Cooties





In its quixotic

quest to protect us from expectant

mothers, survivors

of cancer, and folks

hustling to make their flights, the Transportation Security

Administration (TSA) has painted itself into a corner. Apparently,

it employs lopsided proportions of men and women because more of

the former than the latter are willing to grope groins for pay.

Yes, this

reverses the stereotype of prostitution as a woman's crime. But

it also undermines one of the very few ""important

rights"" the TSA magnanimously grants in exchange for stripping

every Constitutional protection from us: ""All

pat-downs [sic for u2018sexual assaults'] are only conducted

by same-gender officers [sic for u2018assailants'].""

Add to this

imbalance the likelihood that the Thousands of so-called men Standing

Around the checkpoints ""randomly"" select more buxom or

attractive female than male passengers to paw. Even if they don't

manhandle the victims themselves, anecdotal evidence confirms they

watch

and leer.

And so while

the lines of women awaiting molestation grow ever longer, the supply

of thuggettes dishing it out grows shorter. Or, as the Washington

Post editorializes in its ""Local"" news, ""Building

a diverse workforce has become a mantra, hopefully not a hollow

one, for organizations in the public and private sectors. For the

Transportation Security Administration, gender diversity is more

than a goal, it's an absolute necessity. … what happens when there

are too few female TSOs [sic for u2018assailants'] to handle""

— ha, ha! What a punster! — ""the load of female passengers?

The answer at Washington Dulles International Airport and others

across the country has been to transfer female screeners [sic

for u2018assailants'] from baggage inspections to passenger lines.""

I know your

heart will bleed as does mine for Our Mistresses when you learn

of their suffering from this decision: ""Placing

women on the passenger lines might seem like a reasonable solution

to the staffing problem, but it has ramifications for seniority,

transfers, promotions and pay. … [It] also complicates … bidding

for shifts. All the women at Dulles, for example, would have to

bid for checkpoint shifts, while men could bid for shifts in baggage

and checkpoint. One result could be an exacerbation of child-care

problems for women.""

Ironic, isn't

it? Perverts caught sexually assaulting their sisters outside airports

usually forfeit their children to the State; those molesting us

inside airports enjoy the WaPo's concern about their ""child-care

problems.""

Other parties

equally unsavory also bewail this injustice to female slime. Labor

unions that couldn't care less about the TSA's gate-rape exploit

the agency's newest insult to the rapists. The TSA ""'forces

[women] into a single-function capacity as opposed to dual- function,

as they were before,' said Valyria Lewis, a Memphis TSO speaking

in her role as president of AFGE Local 555, which covers [sic

for u2018curses'] Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama. u2018It

limits their marketability to other airports.'"" Aaawwwwww.

Valyria's union

brings us to the reason that Congress authorized the TSA in the

first place, despite the agency's endless violations of the US Constitution.

Joseph and Susan Trento explain in Unsafe

at Any Altitude: Exposing the Illusion of Aviation Security

that a ""government labor union …was pressuring Democrats

such as former representative Richard Gephardt to support a huge

federalized workforce to replace the private screeners."" They

quote Kenneth Quinn, formerly an attorney with the FAA, who noted,

""…you had a federal union that really wanted fifty-five thousand

jobs, a very powerful PAC, and they are, like, 95 percent Democratic…They

saw it as a great opportunity to get a bunch more members into a

federal government union.""

But the leg-breakers

had to wait until a socialist Democratic administration replaced

a socialist Republican one to realize their ambition. Then, bingo:

John ""The Pervert"" Pistole, ""TSA

Administrator … announced that after an exhaustive review of

data … [blah, blah, blah], he has decided to grant partial collective

bargaining rights to the TSA workforce."" Next time a deviant

abuses you at the airport, grab a unionist and thank him.

Valyria is

everything we might expect from someone doubly degenerate, a savage

who not only sexually attacks others but bosses a union's local

chapter, too. These twin vices apparently leave her no time for

exercise, judging from her intimidating

girth. Nor does she disappoint when it comes to aggression or

belligerence. In short, I feel exceedingly sorry for any suitcase,

even if it's a Samsonite, forced to endure Valyria's attentions,

let alone a woman of mere flesh and blood.

Meanwhile,

the TSA's ""schedule

change based on gender"" called all of Valyria's very limited

eloquence into play. “It’s just un-American,” splutters

this harridan. And she should know: she makes her living off

perhaps the most un-American behavior Leviathan has ever unleashed.

“As a woman, I was outraged.”

Valyria, we

hear you. Anyone of even minimal decency has nearly choked on his

outrage each time you and your accomplices assailed another passenger

for almost a decade now. A very, very long decade, I might

add.

Our nincompoop

""traveled

to Nashville this week over concerns about a memo [regarding

the u2018schedule change based on gender'] posted behind glass at Nashville

International."" Whether she refers to the trip or the memo

when she huffs, “It was desperation. It was anger. It was a feeling

of helplessness and hopelessness because they felt that they had

no other outlet,"" I have no idea. Nor is there any clue as

to who ""they"" are. But I warned you about the limits to

the eloquence here, didn't I?

No matter.

Valyria is the sort who endlessly, mindlessly spews. “As a woman,

it’s frustrating for me, to tell me that I can’t [search baggage].

To simply just tell me that I can’t because I’m a woman; that’s

frustrating to me,"" — yeah, so you said — ""and that’s

why I make the stand.”

Imagine being

such a mental and moral midget that you consider this a ""stand.""

""'We’ve

fought EEO cases for women across the country and won those

cases because the TSA can’t use operational need to justify an alleged

discrimination,' said Lewis. … 'We’re willing to fight it all the

way to the end…'""

You go, girl!

For sure, the TSA deserves nothing less!

224943,"A philosophy professor named Allen Guelzo discovered in 1995 that one way out of academic obscurity (where most philosophy professors reside) is to become a “Lincoln scholar.” He began writing books that tell the same old, same old, line about Lincoln: he died on Good Friday; he supposedly died for the sins of America just as Jesus died for the sins of the world; etc., etc. His first book of this time is entitled Abraham Lincoln: Redeemer President. Seeking redemption for your sins? Then become a Lincoln worshipper, says Allen Guelzo.

Guelzo now teaches at Gettysburg College. He was recently interviewed by the World Socialist Web Site which describes itself as an arm of the “International Committee of the Fourth International” and “the leadership of the world socialist movement” that is “guided by a Marxist world outlook.” The interview is entirely friendly with every question a “softball pitch.” One striking feature of the interview is how Guelzo’s comments on Lincoln and economics are exactly the opposite of historical reality.

One of Guelzo’s first comments on Lincoln’s economic policies is based on a fake Lincoln quote about which Guelzo is apparently unaware. The Marxist Web site asked, “did [Lincoln] not privilege labor [over capital]”? Guelzo’s response is “He does indeed talk about labor having priority over capital . . .” Part of the Lincoln mythology is that Abe supposedly said: “All that loves labor serves the nation. All that harms labor is treason to America . . . . If any man tells you he loves America, yet hates labor, he is a liar.” In their book, They Never Said it: A Book of Fake Quotes, Misquotes, and Misleading Attributions (Oxford University Press, 1989), Paul Boller and John George concluded that “there is no record of [Lincoln’s] ever having uttered these words.”

The biggest howler of the interview is where Guelzo claims than an un-named “observer” supposedly said that “on political economy [Lincoln] was great, that there was no one better than Lincoln.” Nothing could be further from the truth. Lincoln was a Hamiltonian, which is to say he was a mercantilist. He was slavishly devoted to the Whig policy of economic nationalism as expressed by the “American System” of Hamilton and Clay. This “system” was comprised of protectionist tariffs for the benefit of mostly Northern manufacturers; corporate welfare for road and canal-building and railroad corporations; and a national bank to finance subsidies and bailouts and to ladle out cheap credit to politically-connected businesses.

“Few people in the Whig Party were so committed to its economic agenda as Lincoln,” wrote Michael Holt in The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party. “From the moment Lincoln first entered political life as a candidate for the state legislature he demonstrated an unswerving fidelity to Henry Clay and to Clay’s American system,” wrote Robert Johannsen in Lincoln, the South, and Slavery. Lincoln himself once said that all of his economic ideas came from Henry Clay.

In his book Lincoln the Man Edgar Lee Masters gave a perfect description of the Hamilton/Clay/Lincoln “American System”:

Clay was the champion of that political system which doles favors to the strong in order to win and to keep their adherence to the government. His system offered shelter to devious schemes and corrupt enterprises . . . . He was the beloved son of Alexander Hamilton with his corrupt funding schemes, his superstitions concerning the advantage of a public debt, and a people taxed to make profits for enterprises that cannot stand alone. His example and his doctrines led to the creation of a party that had no platform to announce, because its principles were plunder and nothing else.

This was neo-mercantilism, the very system that genuine “greats” in the field of political economy, such as Adam Smith, have always condemned, contrary to Allen Guelzo’s silly and uninformed opinion. Lincoln’s ruminations on political economy ranged from wrongheaded to ludicrous. He claimed that protectionist tariffs would cause lower prices, the exact opposite of the truth; he advocated autarky, or the complete prohibition of all imports of anything that could be grown or produced in the U.S., thereby depriving consumers of the benefits of international competition and the division of labor; and he compared the sound-money critics of a central bank run by politicians to Judas in one of his zanier speeches.

Guelzo informs the World Socialist Web Site that Lincoln never had a political thought that did not flow from the Declaration of Independence. What Lincoln actually said, however, is that all of his political thoughts flowed from the politics of Henry Clay, not the Declaration of Independence. He once said that his career aspiration was to be “the DeWitt Clinton of Illinois.” DeWitt Clinton was the early nineteenth-century governor of New York who perfected the spoils system during the building of the Erie Canal.

Guelzo also repeats the mantra of Lincoln’s supposedly great “love” for the Declaration of Independence. But the Declaration of Independence was a declaration of secession from the British empire. In it the states are described as “free and independent” in the same sense that Great Britain, France, or Spain were “free and independent” states. Lincoln most certainly could not have “loved” the document that proves that America was created by an act of secession, the very principle of the American Revolution.

And of course there is the blather about how Lincoln “did keep the union together.” Of course, in reality Lincoln’s war destroyed the voluntary union of the founders and replaced it with a coerced, Soviet-style “union” held together literally at gunpoint. Had he not done this, says Guelzo, “This would take the United States off the table as a major world player, and then what would you do with the history of the 20th century?”

Let me take a crack at answering this question. Without U.S. entry into World War I, financed in part by the new national bank of the sort that Lincoln longed for his entire adult life, the European powers would have eventually settled their disputes, as they always had done in the past. There would have been no Versailles Treaty that pushed Germany into the hands of Hitler, and the Russian communists would have been much weaker. Consequently, there would not likely have been a World War II and a 45-year long Cold War that followed.

As a decentralized, federal system that had long ago abolished slavery peacefully, as all the rest of the world did in the nineteenth century (including New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, etc.) America would have been a counter-example to all the world compared to the centralized, socialistic bureaucracies that dominated the 20th century (especially Russia and China and all the other socialist countries).

America may well have not been transformed from a constitutional republic to an empire with military bases in more than 150 countries. Presidents and their propagandists would not have repeated the Lincolnian mantra that “all men everywhere are created equal” to “justify” foreign military intervention in hundreds of places in the name of “spreading democracy and freedom” (but in reality for the purpose of confiscating resources or imposing mercantilism on foreign lands by military force for the benefit of American corporations).

This is not “capitalism” but corporatism or neo-mercantilism. Real capitalism is a system of mutually-advantageous, voluntary trade and does not require imposition at the barrel of a gun. Allen Guelzo is of course oblivious to all of this and relies instead with such silly rhetoric as when he tells the World Socialist Web Site that sleazy, corrupt, politically-connected lawyer/lobbyists like Lincoln were “the shock troops of capitalism.”

502631,"“Revolution in Minnesota,” The Libertarian Forum, August 1, 1969.

The idea prevails that to favor gold or silver money is to be a mossback reactionary; nothing could be further from the truth. For gold (as well as silver) is the People’s Money; it is a valuable commodity that has developed, on the free market, as the monetary means of exchange. Gold has been replaced, at the dictate of the State, by fiat paper – by pieces of paper issued and imprinted by the government. Gold cannot be produced very easily; it must be dug laboriously out of the ground. But if paper tickets are to be money, and the State is to have the sole power to issue these virtually costless tickets, then we are all at the mercy of this gang of legalized, sovereign counterfeiters. Yet this is the accepted monetary system of today.

Not only is this system of the State’s having absolute control of our money been accepted by Establishment economists; it has been just as warmly endorsed by the powerful “Chicago” branch of free-market economists. Twenty years ago, almost all conservative, or free-market oriented, economists, favored a return to the gold standard and the elimination of fiat paper. But now the gold standard economists have almost all died out and been replaced by the glib, technically expert Chicagoites, to a man scoffers at gold and simple-minded endorsers of fiat paper. The gold standard has died from desertion of its cause by the right-wing and its economists. Numerous right-wingers who should know better yet continue to fawn upon Milton Friedman and his Chicagoites. Why? Presumably, because they have power and influence, and one never finds conservatives lacking these days when it comes to toadying the power.

In the midst of this monetary miasma, there has now come a voice from out of the past, from the Old Right, and it is one of the most heartwarming events of the year.

Two years ago, Jerome Daly, a citizen of Savage, Minnesota, a suburban town just south of Minneapolis, refused to make any further payments on the mortgage which he had owed to his bank. At his jury trial (First National Bank of Montgomery vs. Jerome Daly) in December, 1968 before Justice of the Peace Martin V. Mahoney, a farmer and carpenter by trade, at which the bank tried to repossess the property, Mr. Daly argued that he owed the bank nothing. Why? Because, the bank, in lending him money, had loaned him not real money but bank credit which the bank had created out of thin air. Not being genuine money, the credit was not a valid consideration, and therefore the contract was null and void. Daly argued that he did not owe the bank anything.

In making this seemingly preposterous argument, Jerome Daly was being a far better economist – and libertarian – than anyone knew. For fractional reserve banking – now a system at the behest and direction of the Federal Reserve Banks – is, like fiat paper, legalized counterfeiting, the creation of claims which are invalid and impossible to redeem. Furthermore, Daly contended that this kind of creation of money by banks is illegal and unconstitutional.

Even more remarkable than Mr. Daly’s thesis is that the jury unanimously held for him, and declared the mortgage null and void; and Justice Mahoney’s supporting decision, delivered last Dec. 9, is a gem of radical assertion of the rights of the people and a thoroughgoing assault on the unwisdom and fraudulence and unconstitutionality of fractional reserve banking.

Bewildered, the First National Bank of Montgomery, Minnesota proceeded in routine fashion to file an appeal with Justice Mahoney for a higher court. But the catch is that in order to file an appeal, the plaintiff has to pay a fee of two dollars. Justice Mahoney, O happy day, refused to accept the appeal on January 22 because Federal Reserve Notes, which of course constituted the fee, are not lawful money. Only gold and silver coin, affirmed the judge, can be made legal tender, and therefore the fee for appeal had not been paid. Justice Mahoney followed this up with supporting memoranda on January 30 and February 5, which are heartwarming blends of sound economics and strict legal constructionism, and which also declared the unconstitutionality of the Federal Reserve Act and the National Banking Act, the capstones of our current interventionist and statist monetary system.

There the matter rests at the moment; but where does it rest? We have it on the authority of Justice Mahoney that debts to fractional reserve banks (i.e. the current banking system) are null and void, that their very nature is fraudulent and illegal (in short, that the banks belong to the people!), that Federal Reserve Notes and fiat paper are unlawful and unconstitutional.

Never has there been a more radical attack upon the whole nature of our fraudulent and statist banking system.

Furthermore, with these embattled Minnesotans, their radicalism is not only rhetoric; they are prepared to back it up with still further concrete acts. Jerome Daly has already announced that if any higher court of the United States, “perpetrates a fraud upon the People by defying the Constitutional Law of the United States (Justice) Mahoney has resolved that he will convene another Jury in Credit River Township (where Savage is located) to try the issue of the Fraud on the part of any State or Federal Judge”. Daly adds, moreover, that the Constable and the Citizens’ Militia of Credit River Township are prepared to use their power to back up the jury’s decision and keep Mr. Daly in possession of his land. The people of Savage, Minnesota, in short, are prepared to fight, to resist the decrees of the state and federal governments, to use their power on the local level to resist the State.

Many dimwits in the libertarian movement – and they are, unfortunately, legion – have charged that in recent years, I have simply become a “leftist”. From the literature of Mr. Daly and his supporters, it is quite clear that this is a heroic band of Old Rightists, of people who have not been nurtured on National Review or the lesser organs of current Right-wing opinion. I am equally and eagerly as willing to hail their libertarian action for the people and against the State, as I am such “leftist” actions as People’s Park.

The test, as Karl Hess indicates in this issue of The Libertarian Forum, is action; action now vis à vis the State. Those who side with the liberties of the people against the government are our friends and allies; those who side with the State against the people are our enemies. It is as simple as all that. The problem, as far as the Right goes, is that in recent years there have been zero actions by the Right against the State; on the contrary, the Right has almost invariably been on the side of the State: againstthe demonstrators at Chicago, against People’s Park, against the Student Revolution, against the Black Panthers, etc. If the test is, as I hold it to be, action, and “which side are you on, the people or the State”, and not the closeness of agreement on the fifth Lemma of the third Syllogism deduced from whether or not A is A, then the Right-wing in recent years – and this means the entire right, from Buckleyites and Randians straight through to phony “anarchists” (or “anarcho-rightists”) – has been a dismal failure. Indeed, it has ranged itself on the side of the Enemy. Thus, in the matter of tax resistance, ten or fifteen years ago the banner of tax refusal was carried by such “rightists” as Vivien Kellems; now the self-same flag is carried by such “leftists” as Joan Baez.

If the “libertarians” of the Right-wing are at all interested in my approbation, there is a simple way to attain it: to acquire one-hundredth of the fortitude and the revolutionary spirit of the New Left resisters against the State; to return to the tradition of Sam Adams and Tom Paine, of Garrison and John Brown, and, in recent years, of Frank Chodorov and Vivien Kellems. Let them return to that great tradition or let them, as rapidly as possible, sink into the well-deserved dustbin of history.

In the meanwhile, all hail to the heroic rebels of Savage, Minnesota, to the perceptive and courageous Jerome Daly and Justice Martin Mahoney.",lewrockwell.com,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
375874,"1) Uninstall unused programs

New PCs come with a whole load of programs you will never use, and you probably don’t even know they exist.

Some programs even run background processes when you load your computer, even though you are not using them.

To remove all these pointless programs, open the Control Panel’s Programs and Features page, and have a trawl through the list of installed software. Uninstall those that you do not need, while being careful to leave programs your computer’s hardware needs (typically their publisher will be listed as the PC maker’s name or as Microsoft).

If you are still unsure about which programs to use, try a third-party called such as PC Decrapifier – it’s free for non-commercial use – which should tell you which programs you don’t want or need.

2) Automatically delete temporary files

Temporary files amass on your computer through everyday tasks and can remain on your hard disk, slowing the computer down. Getting rid of these files, including your internet history and cookies, should give you a larger amount of hard disk space, speeding up your PC.

To do this, open “My Computer”, and select your local drive (usually C:\). Select the “Windows” folder and then open the folder titled “Temp”.

Use your mouse to right-click on the folder, and in the “View” options, choose “Details”. Once this is done, select all the files that are older than the current date and press the delete key. Then go to the Recycle Bin on your desktop and empty it.

3) Install a solid state drive

Hard drives are the biggest cause of slow speeds and especially slow startup speeds on your PC.

While they are not cheap, installing a solid state drive, which have extremely fast read times, can speed up your startup considerably.

4) More hard drive storage

Even if you make sure to regularly clean out all your temporarily files, if your hard drive becomes 85 per cent full, it’s going to affect your computer’s speed.

If you regularly film videos or use your PC for recording television, then you will want as big a hard drive as you can get, upwards of 1TB in size.

Here is a handy video on how to install your new hard drive.

5) Prevent unnecessary start ups

This method will primarily affect how long it takes for your laptop or PC to startup, but often many of the programs which are launched on startup continue to run and use up your computer’s memory.

To do this, click “Start” and “Run”. In “Run”, type “msconfig” and then press enter. You should then see the “Startup” tab, with all the programs ticked the ones which will load upon your computer starting up. There is a good chance the list will contain a number of programs you might not have realised were running on your computer during startup, or even at all.

You can either manually deselect those which you do not want to load, or click “Disable All” and then select those you want to run, such as particularly important programs like anti-virus software.

Another trick can be removing all the unnecessary fonts Windows loads. Windows 7 loads more than 200 fonts on startup which can slow down the speed at which it boots up. Go to the Start Menu’s search box, search for the Fonts folder and check off all the fonts you don’t need, and click the “Hide” button in the toolbar.

226701,"One of them has been tortured; another is surrounded by armed men and trapped; and the third is hiding ten thousand miles away, in fear of his life. And what were their crimes? Telling the truth.

Talk about a sick commentary on the modern world.

For those who didn’t know, Ed Snowden is the young man who released evidence of the US government purposely trashing the Constitution that they swore to protect. Coming on the heels of the press surveillance, Verizon, IRS, and Boundless Informant scandals, his information on project Prism has capped off quite a run. Whether Americans still have the emotional strength to give a damn, or they are simply looking for reasons to believe, is another question, but this young man is a hero of the highest order.

So is Julian Assange and so is Bradley Manning. They released the truth about what they saw happening. And the gigantic operations are threatening their lives because they do not want you to know the truth.

Let me quote Jesus here:

Everyone who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does what is true comes to the light, that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been wrought in God.

So, who’s on which side of this issue?

The haters of light proclaim that they see more than you do, know more than you do, and are wiser than you. And they go further: first demanding that you give them your money, and then that you thank them for keeping you in the dark.

What would you think if someone who proposed that to you as a business deal?

92492,"Wherever one turns, whether it is on the broadcast news or the Internet, we are bombarded with Swine Flu stories. Government tells us not to “panic,” while it simultaneously engages in activities meant to spread widespread fear. Indeed, as Robert Higgs has written, the very basis of government rests upon cultivating human fear: The people who have the effrontery to rule us, who call themselves our government, understand this basic fact of human nature (about fear). They exploit it, and they cultivate it. Whether they compose a warfare state or a welfare state, they depend on it to secure popular submission, compliance with official dictates, and, on some occasions, affirmative cooperation with the state’s enterprises and adventures. Without popular fear, no government could endure more than twenty-four hours. David Hume taught that all government rests on public opinion, but that opinion, I maintain, is not the bedrock of government. Public opinion itself rests on something deeper: fear. If one wishes to “test” Professor Higgs’ proposition, one needs to look no further than the actions of the Centers for Disease Control, which claims to be in a constant state of readiness in order to protect us from the next pandemic. At the CDC, it always is 1918, and an outbreak of “Spanish Flu” or something like it is just around the corner. A visit to the CDC’s website shows that the CDC has placed the latest outbreak of Swine Flu front-and-center. News reports monitor the every word of the CDC “experts” who are bombarded with questions about whether or not this is the “Big One.” My sense is that the “experts,” the media, and everyone else in the Flu chain will be disappointed when this turns out to be another overblown “crisis” that governments have foisted upon us right-and-left. One must remember that for many years, the CDC has been creating vast emergency “plans” that are supposed to swing into action the minute that a rumor is afloat that someone, somewhere, has the flu. Politicians and media figures also want a cut of the action and make sure that they keep the issue before us, telling us “what we need to know.” Actually, what we need to know is that government is the last thing we need in our faces if there is a real pandemic. That is because governments played a major role in creating the conditions that turned the “Spanish Flu” situation of 1918 into a world-wide tragedy that led to the death of millions. If government is to trot out its “war emergency” model as the way to “protect” us from the flu, perhaps we need to be reminded of how well that model works – in making sure lots of people become sick and die. Most people don’t remember 1918 as the year the flu pandemic began; they remember it as the year that World War I ended. This was the “War to End All Wars,” or so it was called, when a more appropriate title might have been the “War to Permanently Expand the State.” More than 10 million soldiers died on the battlefields of Europe and millions of civilians died deaths of starvation or were killed in the crossfire. Since war is a tool of the state, we safely and honestly can say that the calamities of World War I were state-created. Unfortunately, people did not just die from bullets, artillery shells, bombs, and even starvation. Across the globe, the war resulted in vast swaths of malnourishment as crops were diverted from civilian populations to the huge armies strung across Europe. At the same time, once-productive croplands in Europe were reduced to moonscapes as the armies obliterated the land. But governments were not satisfied with the sheer amount of physical and human destruction. Indeed, the government made things worse through lies, and nowhere was that more apparent that the lies told by state agents in order to “prevent panic” from the onrushing flu epidemic. As Wikipedia points out: The Great Influenza was the source of much fear in citizens around the world. Further inflaming that fear was the fact that governments and health officials were downplaying the influenza. While the panic from World War I was dwindling, governments attempted to keep morale up by spreading lies and dismissing the influenza. On September 11, 1918, Washington officials reported that the Spanish Influenza had arrived in the city. The following day, roughly thirteen million men across the country lined up to register for the war draft, providing the influenza with an efficient way to spread. However, the influenza had little impact upon institutions and organizations. While medical scientists did rapidly attempt to discover a cure or vaccine, there were virtually no changes in the government or corporations. Additionally, the political and military events were fairly unaffected due to the impartiality of the disease, which affected both sides alike. Exacerbating the crisis in this country was the crowding of American troops onto ships following the war’s end, which was guaranteed to spread the sickness and help it spread when the soldiers reached the USA. On the home front, huge war bond rallies in large cities brought people into very close proximity with each other, allowing the flu to spread rapidly. On one end, the government helped to create the conditions that spread the flu; on the other hand, agents representing the state lied about those conditions. By the war’s end, Germany was near starvation (and many people did starve to death during the British blockade that lasted well into 1919), and about a half-million civilians succumbed to the sickness in that country. It is estimated that 16 million people in India died of the pandemic. Yet, when it raises the prospect of a repeat of this very horror, governments engage in more lies. We forget that life expectancy in the United States was in the mid-50s for white males and less than 50 for black men. In countries elsewhere, and especially in Asia and Africa, life expectancy was much shorter. Medical care at that time was primitive compared to what we have today, even in poor countries, and it was not uncommon in that era for people to be exposed to epidemics that pretty much have disappeared today. Even with those odds, the mortality rate during the 1918–1920 pandemic was estimated at between 2.5 and 5 percent. We can be assured today that not only would fewer people become sick, but even fewer people would die. In other words, even at its worst, the current outbreak of Swine Flu, while bad, is not going to turn into a pandemic no matter what CNN and the CDC try to tell us. We supposedly live in an age of “enlightened” government, yet governments in 1918 allegedly were “enlightened,” too, and that was at the height of the “Progressive Era.” The real problem, however, was that those “enlightened” governments had created the very conditions that served as the tinderbox to ignite this pandemic. If anything, governments today seek to restrict human freedom even more so than did governments of that era, as bad as they were. President Obama, like his predecessor, would have no problem grabbing “emergency” powers in order to fight this supposed onslaught of disease. Emergency plans hatched in the bowels of the CDC bureaucracy await implementation, which would release the inner dictator that resides in the hearts of thousands of bureaucrats across the country. I doubt seriously that any plan by government can or will lessen the impact of this current “epidemic,” if we can call it that. However, I also have no doubt that if emergency plans are kicked into place, it will be much easier for the government to call for further states of emergency, with the threshold becoming lower and lower. That we should fear much more than the Swine Flu. May 2, 2009

DIGG THIS

This article follows up on my previous article. It clarifies some questions and provides more specifics. My goal is, at low cost, to get the average investor into a reasonably sensible investing ballpark. In my view, investors should not be spending very much of their capital paying for portfolio construction or portfolio management services. I have two reasons for saying this. One is that a do-it-yourself approach is feasible. There are many index funds that are easy to buy and sell on exchanges as ETFs using a good discount broker, like Scottrade, or through no-load mutual funds. Second, the fees that many portfolio management services charge are too high. The market bears it because many investors lack financial knowledge.

Investors vary in age, income, occupation, tax status, risk preference, and other personal variables. There is no one investment solution suitable for everyone. But, with adjustment to one’s cash position, one portfolio of risky securities can serve surprisingly well to achieve the investment goals of preserving capital, obtaining some growth of capital, and keeping risk to a minimum. That portfolio is the world market-value weighted portfolio.

Suppose W is this world portfolio. Suppose you have money to invest, say $$1,000. You can vary the risk of your portfolio by what fraction you place in W and what you keep in short-term liquid securities like treasury bills or a bank account. A risk-tolerant person might place $$1,000 in W and none in t-bills. A person more risk-averse might place $$500 in each. The fact is, however, that W has rather low risk. Many people will want to invest most of their investable funds in it.

The proportions that the values of major asset classes have within the world portfolio are suitable for a passive investor to mimic. The world’s many investors have an immense amount of information that you and I do not have. If they think that all the stocks in the world should have twice the value of all the bonds in the world, as shown by their market values, then so should we. We should hold twice as much money in stocks as in bonds. If we don’t, we are betting (speculating) against the market and saying that the world is wrong. If we hold all bonds, we are implicitly denying that stocks are worth what the world says.

The world market portfolio is likely to be of moderate risk, and the return it might provide of 7 percent will seem too low for some. But it will provide the highest return for that level of risk that one is likely to find. One can place a greater amount of funds into it to make up for the moderate return. Over time, one will be able to stomach placing a greater fraction of one’s wealth in the portfolio because the fluctuations won’t be as large as if one held all stocks.

Some will want to go for the 9 percent or more that stocks may deliver. Someone asked me why they shouldn’t just hold all stocks and no bonds if they had a long investing horizon, because stocks tend to outperform bonds once the horizon is 20 years or more. The answer is that this is feasible, but it has added risk because one is undiversifying. It is a form of speculation. The fact that stocks have made 9 percent or more in the past and outperformed bonds doesn’t mean they will do it in the future. In fact, bonds did as well as stocks in the 80s and 90s as interest rates fell. You could place all your money in stocks and be making 9 percent for many years. Then suddenly you could run into that rare occasion when stocks decline by 90 percent and then do not recover for 20 years. Stocks are risky. If you place all your eggs in the stock basket, you are speculating. And then you’d better know the principles of speculation. I have nothing against speculation. I speculate. Most of us will do some speculation. I suggest keeping one’s speculations separate from one’s passive investments. Management of them requires very different knowledge and principles.

Now, debt. If you want to build up wealth through investment, you must postpone consumption. You must avoid going into debt to finance consumption. $$1,000 invested at 7% doubles in about 10 years. If you are 20 years old, $$1,000 invested now could become about $$16,000 by age 60 or so. If you borrow to buy something, not only will you not see that $$16,000, but you will be paying someone else interest. Your wealth will not only not grow, you will be enduring something akin to slavery. You will have sold off the rights to your future income from working. You will have to work simply to pay the debt and interest on the debt. You will lose control over your income and wealth. That is the price you pay for borrowing to consume now.

When I speak of real estate investment, I most definitely do not mean your home. You should not consider your home as an investment no matter how economists define the term. It’s better to think of it as a consumption item. You are buying a bundle of future housing services when you buy a home. Any price change in it is incidental. Sure, there are people who speculate on houses. There are people who buy them, fix them up, and sell them. There are people who buy land lots and speculate. People do lots of things. Let them. Unless you intend to specialize in homes as a speculative business, forget it as an investment. A home usually requires a mortgage, so you are in debt. It requires tax payments and maintenance. Buying and selling it is very costly. A home eats money. This is not what you want in an investment.

By real estate, I mean commercial real estate. This includes such things as office buildings, warehouse and commercial space, malls, and apartment rentals. It means that you are the landlord. You collect the rents. Now, you are not going to do this yourself. You will do it by buying shares in companies that own and manage commercial properties. A few decades ago, this market began to open up to individual investors, but the arrangements were quite bad. There were limited partnerships governed by horrendously long and complex agreements. Many investors got burned. Today, the real estate investment trusts provide a stock investment that serves the purpose.

By bonds, I mean corporate bonds. I do not include government bonds in the market portfolio. The market portfolio contains securities behind which are real assets that produce income. Behind corporate bonds are the company assets, which provide net wealth. Behind government bonds are future tax payments that come out of taxpayer income. There is no net wealth in these bonds.

It is difficult to submit to the market’s pricing and not have a speculative view of our own. One might be reluctant to place funds in bonds if interest rates are low. But if one avoids bonds, one is betting on a rise in interest rates over some period of time that will make capital losses offset the interest income. This again is speculation. If you have strong views about the pricing of some sector and you still want to hold the world portfolio, consider phasing in your investment over time. If you think bonds are too high in price, select some horizon, like 12—18 months. Then gradually buy into the bond market. You will be mixing in a moderate amount of speculation into your investment decision. This may satisfy your urge to act upon your own views.

The world portfolio involves a global asset allocation. Investment results hinge primarily on the asset allocation proportions. Managers that advertise tactical asset allocation are speculating on the pricing of various sectors. Passive investment avoids this. Its asset allocation depends on the market value weights.

I have two different methods to estimate market value weights. Both are rough, but they come out close. If the numbers do not all add up, don’t worry about it. I’ve had several classes look into this over the years, and the results always come out about the same. They are approximate, but good enough for practical purposes. We are not sending a rocket to the moon here.

First, for high net worth investors, who hold most of the world’s wealth, these weights in risky securities (disregarding cash assets) are about as follows:

35 percent in stocks

24 percent in bonds

18 percent in real estate

23 percent in other assets

The other assets include all sorts of real assets like gold, timber, art, and commodities. They include foreign currencies, hedge funds, venture capital, private equity, and managed funds. The average investor will not be concerned with many of these things, but we reserve some allocation for real assets below. If and when these assets prove themselves and can be bought by individual investors at a reasonable fee and if they are diversified, then some part of the portfolio could be allocated to them.

The second method uses all sorts of estimates. The amount of real estate in the market portfolio is unknown. By one estimate, there is $$14.5 trillion in commercial properties available for investment. One-third is in the U.S. and two-thirds overseas. By other estimates, bonds are worth $$45 trillion. Non-government bonds are worth some $$32 trillion and stocks worth about $$35 trillion. The S&P 500 is worth about $$15 trillion. One estimate places world investable wealth at $$123 trillion (including government debt). Foreign debt securities are about equal in value to U.S. domestic debt securities. The U.S. stock market, if it is worth $$20 trillion in total, would be 20/55 = 0.36 or 36 percent of the world total.

Starting from $$123 trillion, subtract $$13 trillion for government bonds. That leaves $$110 trillion, of which $$32 trillion is bonds, $$35 trillion stocks, and $$43 trillion is other, mainly real estate. The proportions are

32 percent stocks

29 percent bonds

39 percent real estate and other.

These numbers are close to those found for high net worth investors. It’s not worth getting too fussy about all this. If other real assets are 10 percent, that leaves 29 percent for real estate, which is $$32 trillion. This is inconsistent with the one estimate of $$14.5 trillion, which I think is too low.

The precious metals, art, timber, commodities and such are not as large as one might think in contributing to overall world investable wealth. Without going through an elaborate calculation, they add up to 10 percent at most. I allocate 10 percent. That is generous. One might make it 5 percent.

Putting all this together, I suggest these approximate proportions for the world market portfolio.

35 percent in stocks

25 percent in bonds

30 percent in real estate

10 percent in gold

Then I suggest dividing the bonds into half domestic and half foreign bonds. The real estate may be divided into 1/3 domestic and 2/3 foreign. However, I could not argue with a 50-50 split. The stocks can be divided as 40 percent domestic and 60 percent foreign, based on estimates above.

We then have

14 percent U.S. stocks

21 percent foreign stocks

12.5 percent U.S. bonds

12.5 percent foreign bonds

10 percent U.S. real estate

20 percent foreign real estate

10 percent gold

This portfolio definitely avoids the ""home bias"" that is typical of many investors who stick too heavily to their own countries. Furthermore, it leans toward the faster growing and less socialistically constrained corners of the globe.

The next step is to choose mutual funds for these categories. I can do that in many ways. Whatever selections I might make will be merely suggestive. I have not done a thorough study of all the available indexes and what they contain. I haven’t broken down the above classes into finer categories. There is a great deal I have not done. It’s not clear that it pays to do a great deal more. This is where you can do your homework. You also can subdivide some of the categories still further if you like. My job is done. I have shown you what the passive investing ball game is about.

For U.S. stocks, there is VTSMX, Vanguard’s total stock market index. Also look for their exchange-traded fund that may avoid some costs, which is VTI.

For foreign stocks, there is VGTSX, Vanguard’s total international stock index. See also their VEU.

For U.S. bonds, a mix of maturities is best or else a duration of about 5 years. One may wish to avoid bond funds that have mortgage-backed securities and stick with traditional bonds. One may wish to avoid high-yield bond funds. Keep it simple. One might want tax-exempt bonds. Many bond funds contain government bonds. This won’t matter much. The fund VBMFX is a possible choice. Also see BIV.

For foreign bond index funds, a possibility is EMB.

One might choose RWR for domestic real estate and RWX for foreign real estate.

There are plenty of advisors on how to hold gold. I make no suggestion.

In sum, with about 6 mutual funds and/or ETFs in the proportions suggested, plus a commitment in gold, one can attain an overall portfolio that will be about as worry-free as one can make it. Not only has one diversified very well across sectors and the world, but also within each fund are hundreds and sometimes thousands of securities. Your bet is on the world economy. You cannot make it any more basic than that. You are not speculating on any individual sector, country, company, or type of security. You are so well diversified that a catastrophe in one area should leave you almost unscathed. If the world survives and grows, you will earn a normal rate of return on your investment.

There will be taxes to pay. This is very disturbing. Having paid taxes on your income, you will then pay taxes on what you save. When you die, there will be more taxes. You will wonder why you bothered building up wealth. The government encourages us to be wastrels. It’s a wonder that some of us still save. In America, the official saving rate is zero or negative.

Perhaps your best investment is in travel. You can find another place in the world to live, one that doesn’t tax investments the way the U.S.A. does.

369655,"I know no father who cares a whit about Father’s Day. We are pleased to be doted on by our families of course, but we have no longing to be “appreciated” for our special role in the world. Fathers consider what they do to be carrying out the normal duties and requirements of life itself, not some enormous sacrifice for others that periodically needs to be recognized.

Anyone with a critical sense sees both Mother’s Day and Father’s Day as oddly tainted, somehow inauthentic, trumped days that are different in substance from Easter and Christmas. Why is that?

Well, as purely secular occasions they bear all the earmarks of the Progressive Era in which both of these days originated. They seem to reflect a brow-beating demand on the part of national elites who agitated for these days because somehow our culture was deficient in recognizing the merit of Mom and Dad, and so these days of appreciation seem to mask a school-marmish demand that we shape up and stop taking things for granted.

Sure, fathers and mothers are gravely essential. No question. But must we have a holiday for all gravely essential institutions in society? Do we need a national toothbrush day? Actually, all of February is set aside as National Children’s Dental Month, probably codified by some president along the way, and shame on you if you forgot to celebrate it.

Somehow, dads were able to psychologically manage before 1966 when Lyndon Johnson proclaimed the 3rd Sunday of June as Father’s Day, to be codified further by Nixon six years later. All these proclamations work to displace the traditional and historically organic liturgical calendar that celebrates every conceivable emotion and institution, and has the merit of having deep roots in the history of civilization.

US culture is particularly vulnerable to this kind of manipulation because of its non-liturgical, Puritan origins. Given the degree to which the Puritans hated religious holidays, we should be thankful we have Christmas at all. If the current secular culture wants to take “Christ out of Christmas,” the New England Puritans were first in wanting to take Christmas out of Christ. It wasn’t the postwar atheists who cleared the path for the hegemony of the secular calendar; it was the 17th century Massachusetts Bay Colony and its war on all “superstitious” festivals.

In modern times, it is particularly pathetic that Christian churches have had to reconfigure their own celebrations to accord with these secular occasions. Mother’s Day was actually the Seventh Sunday of Easter on the Christian religious calendar, but Marian songs dominated all Catholic liturgies. Even though this Sunday is Holy Trinity, I’m willing to bet that “Faith of Our Fathers” will be sung in churches across the land.

But its secularity isn’t the only reason to be skeptical of Father’s Day. Its codification by the office of the presidency is extremely annoying. This is the office that starts wars, drafts kids and sends them to their death, raises taxes, nationalizes schools, spies on everyone, tells you what you can ingest or not, purports to replace the role of dads in society and culture, and otherwise creates social and economic havoc in every way possible — oh, and, by the way, also reminds you to have a high regard for mom and dad. Well, anyone with a contrarian streak is naturally going to say: no thanks, hypocrites!

And yet these are not the usual reasons people question Father’s Day. Most skepticism concerns its commercial impact. As Richard Stengel wrote in Time (June 15, 2001), the day isn’t really about the “sentiment about the enduring role of fathers in our lives, but the pervasive tickle of modern capitalism, where in order to enhance the desire for more and more objects, we have to create more and more holidays that are occasions for consuming them.”

Now, in the thousands of online histories of Father’s Day (most of which plagiarize each other), I’ve come across nothing that would indicate that greeting card companies or necktie makers had anything to do with inventing this day. Do the capitalists love it? Of course! Those who profit from the day make money only because they are offering cards and ties that people want to buy for Dad, which is to say that they are providing a service that can be embraced or rejected by the consumer himself.

But let’s say that the holiday had really been invented by a commercial outfit. What if an entrepreneur had the idea of manufacturing a holiday in order to sell products? If this person succeeds in doing so, it can only be because he or she anticipated an unmet need in the marketplace, which is to say, he or she was first in filling a niche.

Let’s say the CEO of Dunkin’ Donuts proclaimed National Donut Day and said it can only be celebrated by eating gobs of donuts bought from DD. This wouldn’t make the holiday less legitimate or inauthentic than government-invented days like Memorial Day or Veterans Day. Why defer to government-created days because those who proclaimed them are selfless public servants but reject commercial days on grounds of the profiteering motivations of the capitalist class?

It is common for people to dismiss Father’s Day on grounds of its commercial nature. There’s nothing at all wrong with that, just as there is nothing wrong with dismissing an ad for dishwashing soap as silly. Anyone living in a commercial society develops a sense of skepticism that is essential for navigating economic life. At the same time, one never hears someone say: “I don’t celebrate Veterans Day; it is a phony holiday invented by the state to trick us into celebrating the government’s wars.” Someone who did say that should be a friend for life!

The beauty of a hypothetical holiday of purely commercial origins (National Microsoft Appreciation Day) is precisely that we can see straight through them. That is why they are unlikely to catch on. In fact, if there is a nationally recognized holiday of purely commercial origin, I would like to know about it.

Government holidays, on the other hand, do take hold, because the government claims to speak for the entire nation. It can subsidize the holiday by shutting all government offices (while still paying employees out of public funds). It can spread posters all throughout its monopoly postal service. It can distribute propaganda through public schools and “public service ads.” This is real manipulation at public expense.

In the history of our forebears, the calendar that determined what we celebrated and why was neither of government nor commercial origin. It grew up around the life of the Christian Church, telling the story of Jesus’s life and the saints and martyrs who lived and died for the faith. It was the product of many centuries of organic development. There was no Father’s Day but rather St. Joseph’s Day.

The liturgical calendar and commercially viable days like Father’s Day do have this in common, however: the energy behind them is supported by the voluntary outpouring of sentiment and/or money from people who are free to choose. Skepticism of today’s holidays is indeed essential, but it should start with commercially unviable days that were invented by the public sector for the public sector (Veterans and Labor). Father’s Day is a minor annoyance by comparison. I’ll take t-shirts and ties over wars and body bags.

Those levels either blow out the bowel tolerance level or get urinated out before they can do their work. But now, you can achieve the results of IV mega-dose vitamin C orally, successfully. It’s called Liposomal vitamin C.

Liposomal vitamin C is a lipid encapsulation of ascorbic acid granules that delivers more vitamin C to cells orally than even mega-dose IV vitamin C. At first, vitamin C expert Dr. Thomas Levy found this hard to believe, even as clinical results were being achieved. He investigated further and was impressed.

It’s estimated that maybe 20% of IV vitamin C volume gets into cells, while 90% of liposomal C permeates tissue on a cellular level. Vitamin C is water soluble, and cell walls are fatty. Liposomal C is lipid (fatty substance) encapsulated on a molecular level.

Real-Life Amazing Results

That’s when his family members found out about a newly produced liposomal C which they brought to Alan daily. Each packet contained one gram of encapsulated vitamin C. Alan consumed six daily and achieved the miraculous results he had experienced with the 50 to 100 grams daily of IV C.

Yes, six grams of liposomal C did the work of 50 to 100 grams of IV C.

He walked out of the hospital in days on his own power. A year later, he was examined and there was no trace of leukemia either. Here’s a New Zealand 60 Minutes video clip that covers his story well.

Another example of liposomal C’s power: at the Fukushima hot spot, a team of orthomolecular (mega-dose supplement medicine) scientists administered 25 grams of IV C before working and six grams daily of liposomal C to one group of site clean-up workers while giving none to another group.

The vitamin C crew came back with no signs of radioactive poisoning while the crew without vitamin C showed high toxicity levels. That radioactive poisoned group was given the same IV and liposomal C treatments as the first group, and they all recovered.

This research team’s efforts at communicating their results were suppressed despite their pleas with various Japanese officials.

222104,"Recently by Gary North: Government Money Masters: Anti-Gold Videos that Thousands of Tea Party Voters Think Are Conservative

I wrote an article with this title on June 6, 1980 in my newsletter, Remnant Review. It is time for a follow-up.

The four G’s seemed prudent in 1980. In early 1980, the American economy was suffering from the worst peacetime price inflation in its history. That was about to reverse due to the Federal Reserve’s decision under Paul Volcker the previous August to reduce the rate of growth in money and let interest rates soar. This would lead to a recession.

By the end of summer in 1980, the United States was in a recession. The Carter Administration was running a deficit in fiscal 1980 of a then-shocking $$74 billion. (Table 467.) Prices were then 40% of what they are today. A deficit that large would be the equivalent of $$203 billion today. A $$203 billion deficit would be hailed today as a political triumph by the Tea Party and cursed as a job-destroying catastrophe by Paul Krugman.

Had you known generally what was coming in 1980, you would have put all of your money into 30-year T-bonds. You would have sold them in mid-August 1982 and bought a no-load mutual fund in the S&P 500. You would have sold that in March 2000 and put all of your money in silver. That was because silver had collapsed from $$50 to under $$5. Or you just bought Wal-Mart shares in 1980 and nothing thereafter. (I moved to Texas in 1980 and recall seeing a Wal-Mart store in some small town. I did not follow through. Too bad.)

We are still around three decades later. The Soviet Union isn’t. Red China is now the fastest growing large nation in history, due to the decision of Deng Xiaoping in 1978 to free up agriculture. Cuba and North Korea are that last nations committed officially to communist economics. They are universally acknowledged failures.

Today, the world is safer in terms of nuclear war. It is far less safe in terms of the stability of financial institutions. It is also becoming clear that governments can default on their obligations. We watch the crisis building in Europe because of the inevitable default of the Greek government on its bonds. The European stock markets rally when Merkel makes some vague statement about German’s commitment to something, but not much. The lemmings see what is coming, but they cannot bring themselves to get out of stocks and stay out. They buy for a day or two. I call these Merkel’s gurgles. They mean little. Investors believe that something will save Greece and the big banks that stupidly believed the previous Greek government and bought Greek IOUs. They believe that the governments of northern Europe can save the big banks of northern Europe. They believe in deliverance by northern government debt — to save the banks from southern government debt.

Why should you care about the four G’s? Why should you imagine that things will not repeat? The financial system held up after 1980. Why won’t it hold up today? Why won’t things be business as usual?

One good reason is that it is clearly not government as usual. The size of the deficit, the gridlock in Congress, the desperation of the unemployed, the ineffectiveness of the Federal Reserve, the inability of the economists to offer a solution, the unwillingness of small businesses to borrow, and $$1.7 trillion in excess reserves in the banks all point to a continuing crisis that is not going away. The government is helpless. The Keynesian solutions are not working.

This clearly cannot go on indefinitely. The federal government is absorbing too much of America’s capital. Its deficits show no sign of ending. A recession will increase these deficits.

When a nation’s leaders are visibly helpless, a few people start looking for ways of protecting themselves. The vast majority have few capital reserves. They live from paycheck to paycheck. The very rich have their vacation retreats. They think they are in good shape. The middle class has little wiggle room.

Along come critics of the system who tell people that they had better wiggle. This message is not well received.

Many are called, but most are frozen.

GOD

In 1980, I wanted to recommend a good book on God. I could not find one that I thought spoke to the issues of the day. As I say, ""You can’t beat something with nothing."" So, I decided to write one. I sat down in early July and started writing. I had no outline. I had an IBM Selectric III typewriter. Over the next 12 days, I wrote a book, Unconditional Surrender. In 1988, I added one chapter. In 2010, I added another. It’s still in print.

My position is clear: if you think you’re 100% dependent on your own wisdom and efforts, you are asking for trouble. You have a heavy load. I know that atheists can sober up, but Alcoholics Anonymous begins with an open statement of dependence on God. I think that’s a good place to begin.

This world is governed by ethical cause and effect. When people vote for a living, they create an economy that is dependent on more theft. Theft-based economies are Ponzi schemes. It’s not just Social Security that is a Ponzi scheme. So is Medicare. So is the FDIC. All governments over-promise. They ask us to become dependent on government promises. The governments issue more promises than taxes and borrowing can fund. Then they inflate.

Government will prove to be the god that fails. That will be a good lesson in theology for hundreds of millions of voters. ""Thou shalt not steal, except by majority vote"" will prove to have been a destructive principle, although widely believed.

GOLD

Gold is the asset that has the longest track record in history. Financial records survive even when written literature perishes. For as long as we have financial records, there are entries about gold. Gold has been the commodity of account in trading societies throughout history.

It is the essence of the arrogance of modern economic theory that economists have dismissed gold as a barbarous relic, a thing of the past. It is a thing of the past, a thing of the present, and a thing of the future. Why? Because gold is one way that rich people can vote against policies of their governments. Rich people can buy gold and store it in Switzerland. They can get out of Dodge, wherever Dodge may be. They can get on a plane and buy their way into anywhere.

The common man could do the same, but he won’t — not until it’s too late. He has heard of gold — mostly negative — and he has stayed on the sidelines, waiting. The common man can no longer afford to buy a dozen one-ounce gold coins. In 2001, yes, but not now. He missed the boat.

There is no commodity, no strategy, no place of safety in a world dominated by governments who preach the gospel of salvation through legislation. There is no hiding place today in a world that really does believe in safety through voting. But for those who look for a tried-and-true port in the storm, gold is better than any other commonly marketable asset.

It has been the focus of a move from $$257 to $$1600, 2001 to today. This, despite the nay-saying of the talking heads, the tenured economists, and the financial press. The run up has come from outsiders With the banks in panic mode, building excess reserves, prices have not risen much, despite the enormous increase in the monetary base since 2008.

Gold is a crisis hedge. It is a buy-and-hold investment. The American public buys gold only when spooked. Then their fear subsides. That is why it went to $$1900 and then fell back. The late-comers think there is something magical about gold. There isn’t. Gold is an asset that rich people buy when they get frightened. But then there is a positive press release from Merkel, or some vague statement from Bernanke, and demand falls. Prices fall.

The reality is clear: at some point, the vast increase in the monetary base will be monetized. The FED will inflate more in order to make a market for Treasury debt. Then gold will again be the focus of panic buying.

We are seeing the decline of faith in the state, but nothing has replaced it in the thinking of the elite. They do not know where to turn. This decline of faith will create a decline in the demand for digital money. We do not know when. Prices are not rising much. The economy remains stagnant. But the central bank cannot keep recession away by adopting stable money. Volcker’s FED did, but that produced two recessions and also Reagan’s $$200 billion deficits. The thought of what the next recession will do to the Federal deficit is frightening today. But it will come. We will have to deal with it. One way for people with extra money will be gold.

But gold buyers must think through why they are buying gold. They must decide which form is best for their purposes. Here are traditional reasons:

To transfer to children at their death. (Buy small gold bullion coins.) To invest in an SEC-regulated portfolio. (Buy Central Gold Trust.) To sell for digital money. (Buy one-ounce bullion coins.) To barter in a crisis. (Buy small bullion coins.) To hold outside the country. (Buy GoldMoney or Bullion Vault.) To sell to capitalize a business (Buy one-ounce bullion coins.) To sell to pay off a mortgage (Buy one-ounce bullion coins.)

The third use — barter with gold coins — is a long-shot. If it comes to that, you will not get a good return, compared to having the things you are trading to obtain. Think about such conditions. You are so desperate that you are willing to surrender gold coins. That indicates a desperate situation. The seller knows you are desperate. He will drive a hard bargain.

I tell people to begin accumulating those things that would be so desirable in a crisis that they would be willing to pay for in gold. In most cases, these are common things in normal times. You can buy them at Wal-Mart or even Dollar General. You can buy them in bulk at Sam’s Club or Costco. Why not buy them now? Why not buy them on sale in normal times?

If your goal is to barter, then buy now. Barter is inefficient. It takes place when the division of labor has contracted. If we get to hyperinflation, which I doubt, we will be far better off with consumer goods in reserve. We can quietly consume our hoard, never calling attention to ourselves.

When you go looking for goods that can be bought by gold coins but not paper money, you expose yourself. You must locate a reliable seller of desperately needed goods. You will not find this person on Craigslist. Would you respond favorably to an ad that announces this? ""I can get you whatever you need for gold coins. Contact me today."" I think I would skip that offer.

Barter is a limited market. That means that transaction costs are high. That means losses when compared to transactions in normal times. Barter may pay better than not bartering, but not bartering is better if you possess the consumer goods that people are willing to pay gold to buy.

What do you want to do with the gold? This scenario should determine how much gold you should own and in what form.

GROCERIES

I use this in the broadest sense: immediate consumer goods. These are goods that you must have. To get them, you must pay.

Think of bottles of water two hours before a scheduled hurricane strikes. The bottles will not be on supermarket shelves. It will be illegal for retailers to hike the prices of these goods. It’s first come-first served. Getting in line early pays. Waiting doesn’t.

Most people wait.

Get in line early.

The economic conditions that would make food scarce are either local (hurricane) or catastrophic (national). There are scenarios in which catastrophe is possible. Most involve plague. The recent movie ""Contagion,"" presents such a scenario. It is possible; it is not likely.

A complete failure of the banking system is another. This would be a black swan event. If the banks go down and stay down for two months, Western civilization collapses. The death toll would be enormous. Most people could not survive in such a scenario. I do not think it pays to prepare for such an event. The likelihood is too low, and so is your ability to survive for years on end under such conditions.

The great advantage of storing up basic consumer goods is that you can rotate them. You buy on sale. You use these goods to replace what you are consuming. You therefore lower your cost of living by means of bulk buying. This is good economics. The fact that it serves as a cushion for a time of disruptions is gravy.

Here is what could happen. You could lose your job. If you are in that form of crises, you want a cushion. You will be using money to make payments on your home. Maybe not even that. Maybe you pay the water bill and electricity. You dip into bank reserves. You watch every expense. That is when you start consuming your reserves. This is not eating your seed corn. This is living on reserves that you built up for a time of crisis.

I have a theory about the collapse. Cities will keep public utilities operating. They do not dare let water and power go down for more than a week. The threat of panic is too great. Even in Baghdad, there are rolling blackouts, not constant blackouts. The city fathers know what would happen if there were no public utilities for a month. People would start moving out. The tax base would collapse.

The people who have built their careers on getting elected know what has to be delivered by the state. They will allocate their money the way that anyone else that is buying something allocates his money. They are buying votes. You can be sure that they will not turn off the flow of funds to any sector of the economy that services the needs of every voter in the city.

A garden is a way to store up food. It is expensive. Your time is valuable. But it has its own rewards. The food is better in all respects. It is there in an emergency. A garden does not identify anyone as a crackpot survivalist. It is a point of contact with neighbors. It is something that you can recommend to a neighbor as a way to reduce the vulnerability of the neighborhood in a crisis.

I recommend non-hybrid seeds. You can re-plant the seeds produced by these plants. They build up immunities to local plant diseases over several seasons.

GUNS

Guns are controversial. I don’t think you need an arsenal. You need a few simple weapons and the training to master them. This poem gets the point across.

A .45 for the bedroom, A shotgun over the door, A 30.06 for distance, You don’t need any more.

I would add a snub-nosed .357 for a lady’s purse. Two shots will normally settle the issue. Either the assailant runs or else he cannot run.

You do not have to be an expert marksman. If you can hit a man-size target at 20 feet, you will do just fine.

The idea that guns are required for defense against gangs is naïve. A gang that comes into your neighborhood to pillage is going to be better armed than the police. They will be carrying automatic weapons. You will not win a shootout with a determined gang. The best you can hope for is that the members decide that there are lower-risk victims nearby. A shotgun is your best means of persuasion. There is nothing like the sound of a shotgun being racked to persuade someone that he has other urgent business elsewhere. The goal is not to convince the gang not to come through your door. The goal is to convince the first three members not to come through your door.

You do not want to go outside your home to confront an armed gang. The guns must be defensive. You want the invader to take the risk of coming through your door. He should bear the risk.

I think you should take a firearms course from local authorities. Get certified. If there is a concealed carry permit in your state, apply for it.

The United States has a long tradition of gun ownership. I hope this will continue. Support for an organization such as Gun Owners of America makes sense.

It’s not that you need guns to keep law enforcement officers away. That is suicidal. Guns are necessary to send a message to the kinds of college-educated voters who favor using the state to compel people to submit the their social reform programs. It makes those people very nervous that there are millions of gun owners out there. This is altogether positive.

I think of the scene in The Day the Earth Stood Still, when the world comes to a halt. The professor, who knows why it has come to a halt, asks his secretary if this makes her nervous. She says that it does. ""That’s good,"" he replies.

If the state can take away our guns it is because we have moved past the point of no return politically. Owning a gun testifies to yourself that you have still not crossed the line. In this sense, gun ownership is part of positive self- reinforcement.

CONCLUSION

The four G’s are important for reducing our concern against unforeseen negative events. Instead of worrying about them, we take concrete steps to deal with them. Most of them will not occur. But if they do occur, we will be in a position to deal with them in the short term.

Any series of events that cannot be dealt with with a two-month supply of food, water, and basic necessities will be so overwhelming as to make extreme preparations problematical. Most people cannot afford extreme preparations. They will not take even minimal preparations.

If you are diligent about spending money and time wisely in order to reduce your vulnerability to the unexpected, that is sufficient. You cannot afford to deal with every contingency. But you should deal with those that could disrupt your life if you had made none.

If you want to plan for a crisis, plan for unemployment for six months. That is scary enough.

have just returned from a trip to the Gulf Coast. Members of my

church organized relief supplies and formed a cavalcade of trucks

carrying food, water, and clothing. We initially went to help a

small church in Bayou LaBatrie, a church whose congregation had

been involved in the relief effort almost as soon as Katrina had

passed. Finding our help was more desperately needed in Biloxie,

we formed up with a similar group that had come down from Michigan

and proceeded on to some of the worst hit parts of the three-state

area. The scope of the devastation is simply beyond human imagination

and I came back to Georgia despondent and pessimistic. The realistic

hope to rebuild the Gulf Coast in our lifetime seemed beyond the

bounds of the possible. However, I had a long conversation with

my long-time libertarian nephew, who had an ingenious suggestion.

The Gulf Coast should be declared a tax-free and regulation-free

zone, at least for a limited period of time. Period. It is a simple

idea, but like many simple ideas, it has profound implications,

some of which I would like to explore. In the first place, the “limited

period of time” would have to be defined. I would prefer it to be

indefinite, but to expect that the government would forego their

tax and regulatory power forever is simply unrealistic. I suggest

that 10 years would be a realistic period. It would allow a reasonable

period of time for those who wished to move into the area (I do

not limit these people only to those who left, but to those

who would want to live there under the conditions proposed). The

area would be a tax-free zone. The miniscule amount of funds needed

to provide police protection would be provided by user fees. This

freedom from taxation must be absolute. There would be no federal,

state, or local taxes whatsoever. There would be no Social Security

taxes withheld from paychecks, no Medicare taxes, no capital gains

or unemployment taxes paid by businesses (nor any other business

tax, for that matter), no property taxes, special assessments for

neighborhood improvements, sales taxes, inheritance taxes, fees

paid for business licenses, and so on. And the miniscule amount

of revenue raised by user fees would go toward the provision of

police protection of person and property, and the enforcement of

voluntarily agreed upon contracts. Yes, I know that many anarcho-libertarians

such as myself believe that protection could best be provided by

private agencies. But I think that is too big a leap right now for

the average American to even consider. What of all the “services”

that government now provides? All would be provided by the private

sector, that is, by entrepreneurs seeking to make a profit by providing

for human needs as demonstrated by the process of the free market,

supply and demand and the adjustment of prices that demonstrates

consumer preferences. Schooling? It would be expected that many

parents would home school, but I expect that many private schools

would spring up. The success or failure of any such enterprise would

be determined solely by how well consumer needs are met. Fire protection?

Private companies, volunteer organizations, insurance cooperatives

organized by businesses, who knows what the private market would

do or how the system would evolve? And I leave it to a possible

future article to explore the ramifications of no government regulation

whatsoever. But natural law, rather than administrative law, would

prevail. That is, murder, theft, rape, fraud, and all crimes that

violate the inviolability of one’s sovereignty over one’s body and

the fruits of one’s labor would be absolutely prohibited (unlike

in the present system).

What of those receiving government subsidies? There would be none.

Anyone who chose to live in the affected area would forego any and

all government handouts, at least until they chose to leave the

area or the grace period expired. This would be an attraction to

those who might be receiving some assistance now but who might be

attracted by the idea of true liberty and the chance to improve

their standard of living without any government interference whatsoever.

The attraction to dynamic and flexible businesses to move in and

to conduct their affairs so as to operate in the most efficient

manner and without the incredible burden of complicity with the

endless amount of government regulation, would be undeniable. Likewise,

the prospect to potential employees to take home all the

fruits of their labor would act as a strong inducement to bring

back productive people into the area. It is estimated that up to

50% of our income is now confiscated in one way or

another, and that regulatory costs drive up the cost of living perhaps

by 50%. Even if nominal wages were to lower, because of the

absence of minimum-wage laws, for example, real wages and

standard of living would be higher because of increased purchasing

power. What would this increased purchasing power buy? Some with

high time preferences might choose to spend it all on present goods.

Others might choose to save a significant portion, perhaps to invest

in the affected area so as to continually improve their standard

of living. But whatever would be done, would be done without any

government coercion whatsoever. Each person would be free to live

his or her life as he or she saw fit. But government involvement

with their lives would be virtually absent.

Who would choose to live under those conditions? They would tend

to be the most self-reliant, independent, adaptive, and productive.

That in itself argues for an industrious and hardy population of

people who would resettle the area. A major attraction to the American

taxpayer is that virtually no tax funds would be involved

in the rebuilding effort. The foregone taxes are already lost, as

the area is consuming tax funds now and won’t be a tax provider

for the foreseeable future. The displaced persons who are the recipients

of tax relief now are going to be receiving tax relief under the

present system whether the Gulf Coast is rebuilt or not. Certainly

the immediate relief efforts are needed and the various private

relief organizations I observed are doing a superb job and should

be encouraged and supported (but not by government). But to expect

that the government is going to rebuild New Orleans and the rest

of the Gulf Coast is to have faith in an institution that long since

broke faith with the American people and continually shows its ineptitude,

on a larger and larger scale as time goes by. It does one thing,

and does it very well…it “eats out our sustenance” and exerts

more power over us day by day. It can’t improve things, but it can

always make things worse. The only way New Orleans and the

rest of the Gulf Coast is going to recover from this unprecedented

disaster is to allow the free enterprise system to do what it does

best, create wealth, satisfy human needs, and improve the standard

of living for all.

I sent the following letter (below) to the editor of the American Family Physician Journal. I wrote the letter after reading an article about the shingles vaccine. “Do I need the shingles vaccine,” is one of the most common questions I receive in my practice. I hope this letter will help you decide on whether to get the shingles vaccine. I have reprinted the letter that I sent to the editor. This letter was rejected by the American Family Physician Journal.

Original article: Prevention of Herpes Zoster in Older Adults by Jared Kocher published on November 1, 2013

The author wanted to answer the question, “In older adults, is vaccination against herpes zoster effective and safe? The author summarized the Cochrane Review and stated that, “The herpes zoster (shingles) vaccine has demonstrated effectiveness in preventing shingles in older adults.”

However, reading the section titled Practice Pointers presented a different picture. In this section, the author states that, over a median surveillance period of 3.12 years, with over 52,000 participants, there was a 51% relative risk reduction in confirmed cases of herpes zoster in those that received the vaccine. Furthermore, the author stated that among those aged 60-69, the number needed to treat to prevent one case of shingles was 50. Among those 70 years and older, the number needed to treat was 100.

These numbers show that, in those aged 60-69, the shingles vaccine was ineffective for 98% (forty-nine out of fifty) of those studied. For those aged 70 and older, the vaccine was 99% ineffective, since 99 out of 100 received no benefit.

This acronym refers to the Onboard Diagnostics II computer (and interface) that all cars have had for about 20 years now (since the mid-late 1990s). The OBD system governs the operation of the engine and related systems. If a problem is detected, a trouble code is stored in memory – accessible via a scanning tool that plugs in to a universal port (it’s the same in all cars, regardless of make/model) that’s usually located near the hood release catch in the driver’s side footwell area.

If a trouble code is thrown, the yellow “check engine” light in the main gauge cluster will come on and stay on, indicating the need for service.

Normally, this light only illuminates momentarily when you first start the engine, then goes off. If it comes on and stays on, it is not an emergency – you can continue to drive – but you should take the car in sooner rather than later to avoid a small issue becoming a big one.

Be aware: In states that have mandatory emissions testing, an illuminated “check engine” light will result in the car failing the test. Which usually means you can’t renew the vehicle’s registration – or get it, if you just bought the car used.

If you’re looking at a used car prospect, note whether the “check engine” light comes on at start-up and then goes off right away. If it stays on, there could be an expensive problem with the emissions controls, including the Docooler Obd-ii Obd2 1... Buy New $$8.99 (as of 05:20 EST - Details) catalytic converter. You want that resolved before money changes hands.

Be sure to drive the car around for at least 15 minutes or so, incidentally. Because it’s possible someone with a scan tool (see below) cleared the trouble code(s) from memory. This will temporarily cause the “check engine” light to go out. But if the underlying problem that triggered the code wasn’t fixed, the light will come on again.

And if it does after money changes hands, it’ll be your problem.

* “02” sensors –



If the “check engine” light comes on, a fairly common reason for that is a bad O2 – oroxygen – sensor. Take a look at your car’s exhaust system. You’ll see pipes and mufflers and things that kind of look like mufflers (these are the catalytic converters, which are mounted upstream from the mufflers). Somewhere forward (closer to the engine) you will also see a stubby little protrusion screwed into the piping, with an electrical pigtail on the back end of it. This is an 02 sensor – and your car may haveseveral of them. Usually, there is at least one ahead of the catalytic converter – and one right after the catalytic converter. If your car has a V6 or V8 engine, you may have as many as four 02 sensors.

The 02 sensors sample the exhaust stream as it flows past, noting its chemical composition. This, in turn tells the OBD II computer whether the engine is running within spec and not too rich (excess gas in the air-fuel mix) and so on, which is critical for both emissions control and top performance/efficiency.

The upside is that with OBD – and a scan tool – it is possible for a technician to knowwhether the car has a bad 02 sensor rather than guess. The trouble code he pulls from the OBD II diagnostic port will tell him yes – or no.

You can do this yourself, too. Easily and fairly inexpensively. A hand-held OBD II scan tool costs about $$120 (the better ones give you the code as well as tell you what the code means) and anyone who can turn an ignition key has the necessary skills to plug it into the OBD II port and pull the codes.

Even if you don’t want to do the actual repair work yourself, having the scan tool – and knowing what codes have been thrown can be very helpful when discussing your problem with a shop. You’ll know, for example, that they’re bullshitting you if they claim the OBD computer is telling them you’ve got “x” issue when you checked yourself and found the problem is actually “y”.

I wrote this article on commission in 1986. It celebrates the work of Rothbard, Hazlitt, and Hutt. All three economists were living but largely and tragically forgotten at the time. Today, their books are selling and their influence is wide indeed. It’s not appeared online before:

To most Americans, economists don’t leap instantly to mind as treasures, let alone national treasures. Whether making arrogant and fallacious mathematical predictions, filling the minds of college students with the wrong-headed Keynesian and socialist ideas, or giving a theoretical cover to state inflation, taxation, regulation, and spending — the typical economist is not a friend of liberty.

But all this is a perversion of the pure science of economics as exemplified by the Austrian School and its greatest exponent, Ludwig von Mises. Professor Mises was not only the twentieth century’s greatest creative force in economics, he was also a radiant champion of liberty.

There is a Japanese custom naming great achievers as living national treasures. Scott Stanley of Conservative Digest asked me to name our three living national treasures in economics. I told him that three men stand out as great economists in the Misesian tradition: Henry Hazlitt, W.H. Hutt, and Murray N. Rothbard.

Henry Hazlitt

Henry Hazlitt’s career as an economist and journalist spans more than seven decades. An outstanding teacher of the economics of freedom, he did pathbreaking theoretical work, and made the ideas of Austrian, free-market economics accessible to everyone. One of the most quotable economists of all time, his writing sparkles. And his clear and sprightly style seems — like his commitment to freedom — only to grow stronger with the passing years.

One of his chief accomplishments is the masterful Economics in One Lesson written in 1946. This small volume has educated millions (in eight different languages) toward an understanding of the free market and Austrian economics. It destroys the arguments of socialists and interventionists as it explains the truth. Although it was written more than 40 years ago, there is still no better way to start learning good economics. But the book is shunned by most economists.

And no wonder. If Hazlitt were followed, interventionist politicians and their intellectual bodyguards in the academic world would be unemployed. If it’s not bad enough that he defied the economics establishment, his airtight case for the free market is accessible to the layman, and that’s anathema to the economics establishment. Thumb through any issue of a top economics journal and you’ll know why Hazlitt’s book is considered heretical. Not because it doesn’t make sense, but because it does; not because it isn’t logical, but because it is; not because it isn’t true to life, but because it is. Translate their jargon into English, and we find most economists beginning with such axioms as “let’s assume everybody knows everything” or “nobody knows anything” or “people never change their minds” or “all goods are identical.” Men and women are stripped of their individuality to make them fit into mechanistic models, and the economy is seen as static, or at best a series of shifting static states, without elaboration or the process of change. Deductions from such axioms must, of course, be false.

Hazlitt, like Mises, starts with the assumption that individuals act, that they do so with a purpose, and that as conditions change, their plans change. He makes no separation between “microeconomic” and “macroeconomic,” terms commonly used to give the impression that different principles and laws apply to the whole economy than apply to individuals. So that while it may be justified to talk about purposive action, decisions on the margin, and subjective valuations at the individual level, this is of no relevance for the macro-managers in government.

But Hazlitt is a methodological individualist, and thus recognizes that the economy must be analyzed from the standpoint of individual action. Most economists are notorious justifiers of special-interest legislation because they ignore what Hazlitt so eloquently charts in Economics in One Lesson: the unseen and long-run effects of government policy. To Hazlitt, as an Austrian school economist, “economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.”

Central bank inflation of the money supply, for example, lowers interest rates initially, but leads to higher interest rates and lower purchasing power in the long run, not to speak of the business cycle of booms and busts. Inflation may benefit the government and those who get the new money first, but it hurts everyone else.

Although a formidable scholar, Hazlitt did not spend his career in a university. He was a working journalist of whom H.L. Mencken once said, “He is one of the few economists in human history who could really write.” Born in 1894, Hazlitt went to work in 1913 as a reporter for the Wall Street Journal. He was also an editorial writer for the New York Times and a columnist for Newsweek.

As a very young man, Hazlitt read the Austrian economists Carl Menger, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, and Philip Wicksteed. But the main influence on him was Ludwig von Mises. And in 1940 Hazlitt helped — with the late Lawrence Fertig — to raise funds for a job for Mises at New York University. At a time when every second-rate European Marxist and historicist was getting a professorship at Harvard or Princeton, Mises was blackballed by US universities as “dogmatic,” “intransigent,” and “right-wing.” Eventually Hazlitt and Fertig were able to persuade NYU — where Fertig was a trustee — to allow Mises to teach as an unpaid visiting professor.

Mises and Hazlitt became close friends and he later arranged the publication of Mises’s Omnipotent Government, Theory and History, Bureaucracy, and the monumental Human Action by Yale University Press.

During Hazlitt’s years at the New York Times he wrote about the troubles that would flow from the Keynes-designed Bretton Woods monetary agreements. (His insightful editorials are collected in From Bretton Woods to World Inflation [1983].) Bretton Woods, which Supply-Siders wrongly look back on with nostalgia, guaranteed — as Hazlitt predicted — a world of paper money inflation. It also gave us the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, still major funders of statism.

As Hazlitt has argued, only a true gold standard, with the dollar redeemable in gold domestically as well as internationally, qualifies as sound money. And institutions like the IMF and World Bank only benefit governments and banking interests at the expense of the American taxpayer and the poor in other countries.

Another Hazlitt masterpiece is the Failure of the “New Economics” (1959, and newly in print from the Mises Institute). Here Hazlitt produced what no one else has ever attempted: a line-by-line refutation of Keynes’s General Theory. The book is a patient and meticulous shattering of Keynes’s fallacies, contradictions, and muddled thinking.

A Renaissance man in the Mises tradition, his output includes 25 books — on economics, philosophy, politics, history — plus a novel (also newly in print) and hundreds of persuasive columns and articles.

The Bretton Woods system did break down, of course, as Hazlitt had predicted. But when, many years before, the publisher of the New York Times asked him to reverse his position and endorse Keynes’s phony gold standard, he resigned rather than do so. That act of courage and principle exemplifies his whole life.

W.H. Hutt

It’s possible for a student of economics to go all the way through graduate school without once hearing the name William H. Hutt. Yet his scholarship, bravery, and dogged adherence to economic truth make him a hero.

Hutt, now a visiting professor at the University of Dallas, has labored quietly and with little acclaim for more than 60 years. He is responsible for major breakthroughs in economic theory, a dozen books, and hundreds of articles. Among his most important works are the Theory of Collective Bargaining (1930), Economists and the Public (1936), Economics of the Colour Bar (1964), The Strike-Threat System (1973), and A Rehabilitation of Say’s Law (1975).

Born in 1899, Hutt graduated from the London School of Economics. He published his first major academic article in 1926, refuting the charge that the Industrial Revolution impoverished workers, when in fact it raised their standard of living dramatically. He went on to become the great defender of working people and scholarly opponent of their enemy: labor unions.

Many books had been written about labor unions, usually from a leftist perspective, yet no comprehensive theory of collective bargaining had ever been advanced. Hutt did this while teaching at South Africa’s University of Cape Town. In his The Theory of Collective Bargaining, which Ludwig von Mises called “brilliant,” Hutt exploded the still-common myth that the interests of labor and management naturally clash, a disguised version of Karl Marx’s theory of exploitation. On the contrary, Hutt said, the free market brings harmony. Only government intervention — such as laws favoring labor unions against employers and non-union workers — creates conflict.

Hutt also proved that collective bargaining and other union activities depress wages for non-union workers and the poor. He showed how much better off all countries would be if government-sponsored union activities were banned.

Unlike “liberals” and socialists, Hutt recognized that unionization’s equal wage structure is destructive. Paying everyone the same, regardless of contribution, destroys the incentive to improve. He is also an articulate opponent of the violence endemic to unions, and he has shown that it is necessarily an integral part of their functioning. These ideas, of course, did not sell well in the 1930s. But that never hindered Hutt. He took on another statist idol: J.M. Keynes. While Hazlitt was fighting Keynesianism in the United States, Hutt did the same in the British world.

Economists and the Public was published in 1936, the same year as Keynes’s General Theory 1936. Hutt’s book was already in page proofs when Keynes’s book appeared, but he inserted a warning about the dangers of Keynesianism. In the book, Hutt sought to explain why the obviously superior free market was under attack, and why economists were held in such disrepute. The problem, he stated, was that neither economists nor the public understood the nature and effect of competition, and that only unfettered competition protects the general interest against the government and its interests. In “An Interview with W.H. Hutt,” Hutt said that far from being a destructive force, competition is the “sole principle of coordination in a complex world” and the greatest liberator of the poor, a class which Marxists and Keynesians claim to love, but succeed only in increasing.

In the late 1930s Hutt also unveiled his concept of “consumer sovereignty,” which influenced Ludwig von Mises. In the free market, Hutt said, consumers have the right to buy or not to buy, and therefore producers play a subservient role. The only path to success in a free market is for the producer to serve the consumer. In a statist economy, consumers have no voice, producers don’t know what to produce, and pleasing politicians becomes the road to riches.

In 1939, Hutt delivered another blow to Keynesianism with the Theory of Idle Resources, which exploded Keynes’s theory of unemployment. Keynes had entirely misunderstood how economic resources are allocated. Hutt showed that a resource like labor can be idle only through government intervention that raises its price higher than the community can afford, in light of other demands. This is why minimum wages and unions are so destructive: they inhibit flexibility in the price of labor. With completely free labor markets (i.e., without government intervention or union control), all unemployment is voluntary.

Perhaps a laborer wants to use time searching for another job, or he is holding out for a higher wage. To say that unemployment in free labor markets is not voluntary, Hutt conclusively showed, is to say that all human wants are satisfied, which is to deny that scarcity exists. With this observation, Hutt destroyed the rationale for macro-managing labor policy, and for any government programs to “save jobs.”

Not satisfied with attacking Keynesianism, in 1964 Hutt wrote the first detailed critique of South Africa’s racial apartheid in the Economics of the Colour Bar, criticizing the South African government’s pro-labor-union socialism and interventionism as giving an opening to Communism. Unless the market were freed from state intervention, he showed, there would be bloodshed and a destruction of freedom for everyone. He pleaded for blacks to be given a chance to own their own businesses, and to seek and hold any jobs they were capable of holding, without state discrimination.

Hutt showed that South Africa’s economic apartheid was designed largely to protect white labor union members from black competition. The free market, he said, offers the only hope to minorities and the disadvantaged, and for a free society in South Africa. Government controls benefit only loot-seeking special interests. The Economics of the Colour Bar — which anticipated Walter Williams’s analysis of race and government — is a triumph of the union of theory and policy. This is something most economists shun as “unscholarly.” But Hutt makes no secret of his desire to influence public opinion toward laissez-faire. For this, he was banned from working in South Africa.

As Ludwig von Mises wrote, W.H. Hutt “rank[s] among the outstanding economists of our age.” That he is not ranked as such by the mainstream shows only its deficiencies; it in no way detracts from his magnificent achievements and courage.

Murray N. Rothbard

Ludwig von Mises was the greatest economist and defender of liberty in the twentieth century. In scholarship and in passion for freedom, his rightful heir is Murray N. Rothbard.

Rothbard was born in New York City in 1926. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia University, and studied for more than 10 years under Mises at New York University. However, his degree was delayed for years, and he came close to not receiving it at all, because of the unprecedented intervention of a faculty member.

Rothbard’s dissertation — The Panic of 1819 — showed how the Bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve’s ancestor, caused the first American depression. This offended Professor Arthur Burns, later chairman of the Federal Reserve under Nixon, who was horrified by Rothbard’s anti-central bank and pro-gold standard position.

Rothbard eventually got his Ph.D., and he began writing for the libertarian Volker Fund in New York. Like his great teacher Mises, Rothbard’s views prevented him from getting a teaching position at a major American university. Finally he was hired by Brooklyn Polytechnic, an engineering school with no economics majors, where his department consisted of Keynesians and Marxists.

He worked there, in a dark and dingy basement office, until 1986, when — thanks to free-market businessman S.J. Hall — he was offered a distinguished professorship of economics at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

But this lack of a prestigious academic base did not prevent Rothbard, any more than it had Hazlitt, Hutt, or Mises, from reaching a wide audience of scholars, students, and the general public. Rothbard is the author of hundreds of pathbreaking scholarly articles and 16 books, including Man, Economy, and State (1962), America’s Great Depression (1963), Power and Market (1970), For a New Liberty (1973), Conceived in Liberty (1976), The Ethics of Liberty (1982), and The Mystery of Banking (1983) [PDF].

In America’s Great Depression, an authoritative revisionist history of that economic debacle, Rothbard uses Austrian trade-cycle theory to show that Federal Reserve inflation created the boom of the twenties and the bust of the thirties. Continued assaults on the market from Hoover and FDR — in the form of plant-closing laws, taxation, agricultural intervention, price controls, et al. — prevented a liquidation of malinvestments made during the boom, and prolonged and deepened the depression. This book also contains the clearest and most convincing explanation of the Austrian theory of the trade cycle for students. Both The Panic of 1819 and America’s Great Depression use theoretical tools drawn from the great tradition of Austrian economics, including Carl Menger’s theory of the development of monetary institutions, Eugen von Boeöhm-Bawerk’s theory of capital and the time-preference theory of interest, and Mises’s methodology and trade cycle theory. Rothbard solved several theoretical problems in each, and wove them together to create a formal praxeological model. He succeeded not only in explaining cyclical fluctuations caused by central bank intervention, but also in making the case for the gold coin standard, no central bank, 100% reserves, and laissez-faire.

After Rothbard’s masterful integration, economists can no longer dismiss recessions and depressions as an “inevitable” part of the market economy. Instead, it is clear, they are caused by central bank inflation, and the corresponding distortion of interest rates, malinvestment of capital, theft of savings, and price increases that go with it. Government, of which the central bank is only an arm, is the real source of business cycles.

Though it is still practiced almost universally within neoclassical industrial organization and price theory, Rothbard refuted the fallacy of separating monopoly prices from competitive prices. The distinction between the two only exists in the world of neoclassical pricing models, where businessmen charge higher and higher prices in the inelastic portion of the consumers’ demand curve. But these static models have nothing to do with the dynamic market process. Rothbard showed that a free economy has only one kind of price: the free-market price, thus destroying the entire neo-classical and Keynesian justification of anti-trust policy.

Monopolies do exist, Rothbard shows, but only when government erects a barrier to entry into the market by granting some firm or industry a special privilege. The real monopolies included are admitted ones like the Post Office, somewhat obscured ones like electric power companies, and worst of all, the least-questioned one, the Federal Reserve.

In 1956, Rothbard made the first formidable advance in the field of utility and welfare since the marginal revolution in the 1870s with his article “Toward a Reconstruction of Utility and Welfare.” Building on Menger’s work, he showed that utility is something that we can know only by observing individual preferences revealed through human action. Utility, a strictly ordinal and subjective concept, cannot be aggregated, and thus there can be no total utility. This insight removes the foundation from most modern utility and social welfare theory, which, although disguised, usually relies on interpersonal comparisons of subjective utility.

Not only does Rothbard’s advance affect the pure theory of utility and welfare, but also the policies so often justified by neoclassical welfare models: redistribution of wealth, progressive taxation, and state planning. When individuals are free to trade and demonstrate their subjective preferences without interference from government, each party expects to benefit from the exchange or else they would not exchange in the first place. Rothbard thus deduces that free markets maximize utility and welfare, whereas government intervention, by the very fact that it is forcing people to behave in ways in which they otherwise would not, can do nothing but diminish utility and welfare.

It was this foundation that allowed Rothbard to integrate a rigorous theory of property rights with a scientific theory of economics. Today, others within the Chicago School are trying to do the same through studies in rights, ethics, and the means to utility optimization. But until they accept the theory of utility and welfare as taught by Rothbard, and ground their analysis in the pure logic of action, they will not succeed.

In his great work Man, Economy, and State, Rothbard provides a rigorous defense of economic science. It is a treatise covering the whole subject, and is the last such magnum opus. In it, clearly and logically, Rothbard deduces the whole of economics from its first principles. It is a tour-de-force unmatched in modern economics.

In his Power and Market — originally part of Man, Economy, and State — he develops a comprehensive critique of government coercion. He developed three useful categories of intervention: autistic, binary, and triangular. Autistic intervention prevents a person from exercising control over his own person or property, as with homicide or infringements on free speech. Binary intervention forces an exchange between two parties, as in highway robbery or income taxes. Finally there is triangular, in which the government forces two people to make an exchange or prohibits from doing so, as in rent control or minimum wages. He carefully outlines the bad effects of every possible intervention in the economy, refutes moral objections to the market, and develops the first and only praxeological critique of all types of taxation, showing that taxes are never neutral.

Rothbard also broke new ground in attacking government statistics. Because the government lacks the knowledge generated by the market, it must collect millions of statistics to plan the economy, which of course it is ultimately unable to do. Among Rothbard’s least favorite statistics is the “trade deficit,” which is only considered a problem because government keeps the figures. Thank goodness, he has noted, that trade statistics aren’t kept on Manhattan and Brooklyn. “Otherwise we’d hear cries from Brooklyn politicians about the dangerous trade deficit with Manhattan.”

Another statistic he dislikes is GNP. This number counts welfare payments and all other government spending as “productivity.” His own alternative, PPR or Private Product Remaining (for producers), shows a much clearer picture by subtracting government spending from the economy. He has also — with Professor Joseph Salerno — constructed an Austrian alternative to the Federal Reserve’s money supply statistics, which are constructed without regard for theoretical consistency. Not only is he a brilliant economist, he is also a master of narrative political history, as his four-volume colonial history of the United States, Conceived in Liberty, shows; and a great philosopher in the individualist tradition, as demonstrated in the Ethics of Liberty. His current project is a massive history of economic thought from an Austrian perspective that covers the ancient Greeks to the present. Judging by the chapters so far, this will be the greatest study of its kind ever written.

Rothbard is a writer of singular power, whose words fairly glisten on the page. Like Mises, he has inspired millions with his vision of the free society. In the academic world, where devotion to principle is as popular as it is in Washington, he has carried the torch of pure Misesianism.

Three Giants

Like Mises, these three giants exhibit extraordinary ability, courage, personal gentleness, and an unbending adherence to principle. In an age when loot-seeking is the norm among politicians — governmental and academic — Hazlitt, Hutt, and Rothbard have held high the banner of truth and freedom. They have faced immense pressure to retreat, but never wavered. Today they are still at work extending the scholarship of freedom. Despite the barriers they have faced in the past, today their influence is spreading. And it will continue to do so. In their fight for liberty and the free market, they have one asset the other side cannot match: the truth.

For years,

the condition, which causes interruptions in breathing during sleep,

has been linked to high blood pressure, strokes and heart attacks.

It also raises

the risk of car and work accidents.

But now an

Israeli study of 600 people over 65 has found that the risk of early

The study also

showed that the risk of early death for those with a severe form

of the condition was the same as a healthy control group, when it

One theory

is that the constant breaks in oxygen and blood supply to organs,

caused by the pauses in the breathing, somehow strengthen the heart

and brain; this means that if a heart attack or a stroke occurs,

the body is better able to deal with it.

Researchers

say that the way the condition is treated in older people may need

to be re-examined.

Sleep apnoea

can result in the airways in the throat collapsing, cutting off

the air supply for about ten seconds a time.

Many of these

breaks can occur during the night, but because the sleeper wakes

Today’s featured video is a lecture by obesity researcher and neurobiologist Dr. Stephan Guyenet.1 In it, he discusses some helpful and practical tips about the neurobiological underpinnings of our eating habits that can help you better understand why you gain weight.

He starts off by noting that the obesity epidemic closely parallels an increase in daily calorie consumption in the US. Compared to 1960, Americans eat an average of 363 calories more per day today. But why do Americans eat so much more now compared to previous decades?

Guyenet goes on to review some of the alterations to the US food system that promote overeating, stating that the human “brain’s hardware may not be up to the task of constructively navigating the modern food environment.”

Research does show that what you eat can make a big difference in how muchyou eat. As noted by Christy Matta in a previous article:2

“One study,3 for example, found that obese subjects ate 81 percent more total calories after eating two meals of instant oatmeal than they did after eating two meals with the same calories in the form of a vegetable omelet and fruit.”

In a nutshell, research shows that calories gleaned from bread, refined sugars, and processed foods promote overeating, whereas calories from whole vegetables, protein, and fiber decrease hunger.

While Guyenet reviews the role of your brain in all of this, other researchers have clearly demonstrated how your body’s metabolism is altered by the foods you eat—as well as the impact of synthetic and toxic chemicals.

Calories are not created equal, and as just mentioned, the source of the calories makes all the difference in the world. Groundbreaking research by Dr. Robert Lustig shows that calories from fructose are of particular concern.

According to Dr. Lustig, fructose is “isocaloric but not isometabolic.” What this means is that identical calorie counts from fructose or glucose, fructose and protein, or fructose and fat, will cause entirely different metabolic effects.

However, Dr. Guyenet counters that although this is true at high levels, most of the human studies have found little difference in the effects of sugar versus starch at more normal levels of consumption, as long as excess calories are not consumed.

The reason for the difference in metabolic effects is largely because different nutrients provoke different hormonal responses, and those hormonal responses determine how much fat your body will accumulate and hold on to.

This is why the idea that you can lose weight by counting calories simply doesn’t work. After fructose, other sugars and grains are among the most excessively consumed foods that promotes weight gain and chronic disease.

Another dogmatic belief that simply isn’t true is the idea that obesity is the end result of eating too much and exercising too little; i.e. consuming more calories than you’re expending. Amazon.com Gift Card i... Check Amazon for Pricing.

Here, research by the likes of Dr. Richard Johnson clearly demonstrates that this too is a complete fallacy. Like Dr. Lustig, Dr. Johnson places most of the blame on excessive fructose consumption, and his book The Fat Switch shatters the myth that obesity is the result of eating too many calories and not exercising enough.

Here again Dr. Guyenet disagrees. He believes that developing obesity is impossible without consuming more calories than are expended. If the energy content of your body is increasing, that means ‘energy in’ has to be increasing, and/or ‘energy out’ has to be decreasing. It’s just that many things influence how much is coming in vs. out, for example what type of food you eat.

Although this may be technically correct the wild card here that is frequently overlooked is your body’s ability to burn fat as its primary fuel. Due to insulin and leptin resistance, most people have impaired enzymes to burn fat which lends credence to Dr. Lustig’s and Johnson’s assertions.

The Science of Obesity

While the first law of thermodynamics does apply to humans, in order to actually gain a significant amount of weight, Dr. Johnson’s research shows that you have to do two things:

Block your sensation of fullness, and Impair your body’s ability to burn fat by downregulating the enzymes responsible for metabolizing fat.

What this means is that in order for you to become severely overweight you must first become leptin resistant. Leptin is a hormone that helps you regulate your appetite. When your leptin levels rise, it signals your body that you’re full, so you’ll stop eating. Refined sugar (in particular fructose) is exceptionally effective at causing leptin resistance in animals, and it’s also very effective at blocking the burning of fat…

Guyenet also disagrees with this concept. He believes the most effective way to cause leptin resistance in rodents is a refined high-fat diet. Please note that these are not the healthy fats I advocate like coconut oil, avocados, butter and olive oil, but highly processed and refined industrialized soy, corn and canola oils.

He also discusses the impact of leptin sensitivity loss in the featured lecture. He notes that once your brain has lost its sensitivity to leptin, it will perceive the situation as normal, and will therefore defend that fat mass.

Another interesting tidbit is that if you’re insulin resistant and obese, it doesn’t take much fructose to activate the processes that will keep you fat. Some of Dr. Johnson’s most recent research shows that the more high-fructose corn syrup you eat, the more you absorb and the more you metabolize it. Thus, eating fruits may be more of an issue if you are insulin resistant, whereas fruit intake is likely safer or even beneficial if you are lean and healthy. This helps explain the paradox of how some very fit people can eat a lot of fruit—which is rich in natural fructose—without gaining any weight. NOW Foods Stevia Extra...

Toxic Foods and Bad Habits Hamper Proper Metabolic Function

Over the past 60 years or so, a confluence of dramatically altered foods combined with reduced physical exertion and increased exposure to toxic chemicals have created what amounts to a perfect storm. The extensive use of sugar—primarily in the form of high fructose corn syrup, which is added to virtually all processed foods—is at the heart of it all. But one also cannot underestimate the impact of chemistry, and the creation of truly addictive foods.

If you think about it, it’s quite revealing that, in contrast to third-world countries, the poorest people in the US have the highest obesity rates. This seeming contradiction is, I believe, a clear indication that the problem stems from the diet itself. Something in the cheapest and most readily available foods is creating metabolic havoc, and indeed that’s what studies are finding.

Research into the addictive nature of processed foods reveals that food companies have perfected the art of creating addictive foods4 through the masterful use of salt, fat, sugar, and a wide variety of proprietary flavorings—most of which are far from natural. As a general rule, “food” equals “live nutrients.” Nutrients, in turn, feed your cells, optimize your health, and sustain life. Obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension, and heart attacks are all diseases associated with a processed food diet – a CLEAR indication that it does not provide the appropriate nutrition for your body.

How to Regain Your Lean Body

So if you are carrying more body fat than your ideal, what’s the answer? I believe there are two primary dietary recommendations that, if widely implemented, could help you regain your lean body and reverse our current obesity trend. This kind of diet will naturally shift your body from burning sugar to burning fat as its primary fuel, which will automatically help you shed excess weight, and counteract disease processes associated with a processed, high-sugar diet:

Avoid, sugar, refined fructose, grains, and processed foods Eat a healthful diet of whole foods, ideally organic, and replace the grain carbs with

Large amounts of vegetables

Low-to-moderate amount of high-quality protein (think organically raised, pastured animals). As a general guideline, I recommend limiting your protein to about one gram of protein per kilogram of lean body mass, or one-half gram of protein per pound of lean body weight. (If your body fat mass is 20 percent, your lean mass is 80 percent of your total body weight)

As much high-quality healthful fat as you want (saturated and monounsaturated). For optimal health, most people need upwards of 50-85 percentof their daily calories in the form of fat

While this may sound excessive, consider that, in terms of volume, the largest portion of your plate would bevegetables, since they contain so few calories. Fat, on the other hand, tends to be very high in calories. For example, just one tablespoon of coconut oil is about 130 calories—all of it from healthful fat. Good sources of fat include coconut and coconut oil, avocados, butter, nuts, and animal fats. Also take a high-quality source of animal-based omega-3 fat, such as krill oil

The Case for Intermittent Fasting

Another strategy that works really well in combination with this kind of diet is intermittent fasting. In fact, intermittent fasting, or “scheduled eating,” is one of the most powerful interventions I know of to shed excess weight, as it effectively jump starts your body to burn fat instead of sugar as its primary fuel. There are many different variations of intermittent fasting, but my personal recommendation is to fast every day until you reach your ideal body fat.

You do this by scheduling your eating into a narrow window of time each day. For example, you could restrict your eating to the hours of 11am and 7pm. Essentially, you’re just skipping breakfast and making lunch your first meal of the day instead. This equates to a daily fasting of 16 hours—twice the minimum required to deplete your glycogen stores and start shifting into fat burning mode.

By increasing insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial energy efficiency, fasting helps slow down disease processes typically associated with insulin resistance—which includes metabolic syndrome. Fasting also benefits your body by reducing oxidative stress, and inducing a cellular stress response (similar to that induced by exercise) in which your cells up-regulate the expression of genes that increase their capacity to cope with stress and resist damage.

Intermittent fasting also has the near-magical side effect of eliminating sugar and junk food cravings. While most people will successfully switch over to burning fat after several weeks of intermittent fasting, it may take up to several months for those that are seriously insulin/leptin resistant. Their body needs to learn how to turn on the fat-burning enzymes that allow it to effectively use fat as its primary fuel. So don’t get discouraged. Just keep at it. Once you’ve become fat adapted and are of a normal weight, without high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol, you really only need to do scheduled eating occasionally. As long as you maintain your ideal body weight, you can go back to eating three meals a day if you want to.

Quit ‘Dieting’ and Start Living Healthily

If you want to shed excess weight and protect your health, my most urgent recommendation is to replace processed foods with homemade meals, made from whole, ideally organic, ingredients. Remember to replace the grain carbs with vegetables, small amounts of high quality protein, and plenty of healthful fats. For step by step instructions and guidance, please see my optimized nutrition plan.

Intermittent fasting can further boost your weight loss efforts once you’re eating right, as it effectively helps shift your body into fat-burning mode. Last but not least, exercise acts in tandem with and boosts the benefits derived from a proper diet. For maximum benefits, you’ll want to make sure to include high-intensity interval training, which is at the heart of my Peak Fitness program.

By contrast,

reality-oriented economists (almost synonymous with so-called Austrian

economists) keep the number 95% in mind in the belief that the US

dollar  more accurately, the greenback  has lost about

95% of its purchasing power since World War I. Money prices on average,

in other words, have gone up about 20-fold. While this order-of-magnitude

arises from careful study of commodity and retail prices and tedious

construction of price indexes, a remarkable confirmation of the

plunging value of our paper dollars arises by looking at the rates

charged by the agency nearly every American uses daily, our beloved

US Postal Service. On January 8 the snails imposed a ""rate

change,"" as they gently put it, boosting the price of delivery

of a first class letter by 2 cents to 39 cents. We were all surprised

at this price increase in view of the wondrous USPS productivity

improvements we have been told about since its reorganization as

a ""business"" rather than a patronage operation, right?

Consulting

the government's own Historical Statistics of the United States,

we find that in 1919 the postal rate was 2 cents for a non-local

first class letter. At 39 cents today, the stamp price has gone

up 19.5-fold, a spectacular increase. The economist's 95% general

rule of thumb applies quite well here because it takes 37 cents

more today to get the same job done as it did in 1919 and 37 cents

divided by 39 cents is 94.9%. So in 87 years the dollar lost all

but 5.1% of its purchasing power at the Post Office. As recently

as 1962 the first class rate was 4 cents, only an increase of 2

cents in 43 years; in the subsequent 44 years the stamp increased

35 cents, or 94.5% of the total increase.

During the

19th century when the dollar was redeemable in silver

and gold, imperfect though that money and banking system was, the

overall trend in money prices was to decline except during wars.

Postal prices fit the pattern. In 1799 it cost 8 cents to mail a

one-sheet letter less than 40 miles and 25 cents to deliver it over

500 miles. By 1855 the price was down to 3 cents for delivery of

a one-sheet letter 3,000 miles or less and by 1885 it was 2 cents

per ounce. Variations in postal subsidies can hardly account for

these dramatic price cuts. The fundamental source was economy-wide

productivity gains, especially the plunge in inland freight rates.

Even a privileged monopoly passes on such huge cost savings.

As

you add your 37-cent ""first class"" stamp to your once-powerful

2-cents, rather than curse the USPS for the debasement, direct your

attention to the far more significant cause from Washington, DC,

What’s new in civilization? We went to Cafayate last night. Our old friend Doug Casey hosted an intimate little dinner — for about 150 people. He’s developing a community down there — the kind of place he wants to live in surrounded by friends, good food, bright sun, beautiful views and everything else a man might want.

Whether this is a good idea or not, we can’t say. But it is fun to get together with Doug and his crowd.

Since we were back in Internet range, we checked in with our usual sources. Here’s what we found:

The economy is either growing slowly, or contracting.

Housing is probably going down. Remember, Mr. Market has to destroy the idea that housing always goes up. When he’s finished people will think that housing never goes up.

Unemployment? People are gradually beginning to realize that the last ten years were the worst for creating new jobs in America’s history. If they keep thinking about it they will realize that it is not just the bust that is destroying jobs; there was something very wrong with the boom too.

Meanwhile, the markets are still calculating, figuring, deciding what things are worth. In the last couple of days, they’ve been thinking that maybe stocks and gold got a little too uppity. Gold has lost more than $$50 in the last two days. Stocks lost ground on Tuesday, but bounced up 36 points yesterday.

From all we can tell, the Great Correction continues. And here’s a report from The New York Times that tells us where it leads:

OSAKA, Japan — Like many members of Japan’s middle class, Masato Y. enjoyed a level of affluence two decades ago that was the envy of the world. Masato, a small-business owner, bought a $$500,000 condominium, vacationed in Hawaii and drove a late-model Mercedes.

But his living standards slowly crumbled along with Japan’s overall economy. First, he was forced to reduce trips abroad and then eliminate them. Then he traded the Mercedes for a cheaper domestic model. Last year, he sold his condo — for a third of what he paid for it, and for less than what he still owed on the mortgage he took out 17 years ago.

Japan used to be so flashy and upbeat, but now everyone must live in a dark and subdued way, said Masato, 49, who asked that his full name not be used because he still cannot repay the $$110,000 that he owes on the mortgage.

For nearly a generation now, [Japan] has been trapped in low growth and a corrosive downward spiral of prices, known as deflation, in the process shriveling from an economic Godzilla to little more than an afterthought in the global economy.

The US, the UK, Spain, Ireland, they all are going through what Japan went through a decade or so ago, said Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura Securities who recently wrote a book about Japan’s lessons for the world. Millions of individuals and companies see their balance sheets going underwater, so they are using their cash to pay down debt instead of borrowing and spending.

And by the way, it appears to be entirely legal for a New York Giants fan not to rent his apartment to an Eagles fan. Likewise for the Mets and Phillies.

Should the federal government outlaw this blatant geographic-origin discrimination?

With respect to sexual orientation, the government takes away your freedom. Because of the sensibilities of those with more votes, you are required to rent your apartment to persons of whose actions and lifestyle you might not approve.

And don’t even think of advertising your apartment for rent to “hard-working” or “Christian” people. No, that would discriminate against loafers and non-Christians.

Now, as part of President Bush’s “faith-based initiatives,” the Salvation Army asked the Bush administration for an exemption from federal forced association laws — “workplace laws” — in return for participation in the new federal government “faith-based” intitiatives.

Guess what? This caused a firestorm of egalitarian mania in Washington, DC. Sorry, the White House has said, private charities must ignore — well, their faiths — and toe the federal line.

As the Washington Post reports,

Even after the White House backed down late yesterday, Democratic leaders in the House said they would proceed with an investigation into whether the White House had agreed to allow the Salvation Army and other charities to discriminate against gays, in exchange for the Salvation Army’s support for the Bush faith-based initiative.

But what does it mean “to discriminate against gays?” Was the Salvation Army going to hunt down homosexuals, and ridicule them? No. As a religious organization, they simply wished to retain the right to practice their faith, which disapproves of homosexuality. Sorry, you’re not allowed to disapprove of anyone, let alone refuse to hire them.

Which brings me to two problems with President Bush’s “faith-based” initiatives. First, it is a deal with the Devil, namely, the Federal government — a massive, omnipotent tool of social engineering in the hands of the Left. If adopted, “faith-based” initiatives will open the door to the federally-mandated destruction of one of the few areas of civil society that works, namely, the private religious and charitable arena. Next stop — mandating female priests for Roman Catholics.

Second, although it is admirable of George Bush to discuss religion in the public square — a feat which was almost verboten under the tyrannical reign of the sleazy Clintons (despite the phony photo ops at Baptist churches seemingly every week) — Bush has gotten the relationship between religions and private charity on the one hand, and the government on the other hand, completely backwards.

Yes, private charities — “faith-based” organizations, in the current Federal jargon — do a better job of solving social problems, such as caring for the poor and the hungry.

It is, however, a mistake to therefore have the government enlist these private agencies to do the government’s work. This is the tail wagging the dog.

Recall that prior to the Leftist transformations of the government under FDR and LBJ, private charities did all the charitable work. And they did it well. The government entered the picture allegedly to “make things better.” And so there was a New Deal, a Fair Deal, a War on Poverty, a Great Society…and, predictably, there are more poor people than when the federal government’s snake oil sale started.

Why is that? The reason is that bureaucrats keep their jobs, and agencies keep their funding and their existence only if there are “problems” to be solved. They have no incentive to solve the problems they allegedly exist to “solve.”

On the other hand, a pastor of a church, who must pay for upkeep of the physical grounds, pay the salaries of workers, and minister to the needs of his flock — all on donations, rather than tax dollars, taken at gunpoint — has an incentive to spend wisely. He also has an incentive to genuinely help his parishioners get and keep their lives on the right track. He lives in the neighborhood. He presides at their weddings, baptisms, and funerals. In short, he knows them personally.

Of course, there are private charities which are not religious which do this as well. See A Guide to Effective Compassion, for example.

The idea that the federal government can better attempt to “solve” poverty by roping every private church and charity under federal control is completely misguided. Many churches ask their members to tithe — to donate 10% of their income. How many Americans already tithe five times over — to the government?

Rather than enact the President’s “faith-based” initiatives, the federal government should simply stop frustrating the ability of Americans to live out their faiths. If we want to do a better job of ministering to the poor, the hungry, and those in need, the federal government should stop taxing Americans so much — so that Americans can give their money to those who know how to use it wisely, and who have incentives to actually solve problems.

""I always find it interesting that socialists treat government as a sort of supernatural entity: it affects all things without actually being a part of it. The money and actions they take have no (important) effects apart from what the socialists intend.""

~ Robert Wicks

It takes a lot to surprise me these days. It’s hard not to be cynical when surrounded by uninformed opinions and comments based on ignorance of economics, and by a disdain for personal freedom. Thus, I was delightfully and honestly surprised when I saw this Mises.org blog entry about an editorial in the New York Times called “Charity Begins in Washington.” Having found it so incredibly laughable, I had no choice but to attempt a rebuttal.

In this brief article I shall point out the major fallacies, errors and misunderstandings in the editorial. I ask the reader to forgive my fisking.

Economic imbecility

The problems start right away:

The munificence of American corporate titans warms the heart, sort of. The Chronicle of Philanthropy reports that the top 50 donors gave $7.3 billion to charity last year — about $150 million per head. Excluding Warren Buffett’s $43.5 billion burst of generosity in 2006, last year’s giving easily beat the record set the year before.

I immediately must question the author’s “sort of” remark. Does it not warm the heart? I believe it does, at least most people’s heart. Maybe the Times employs heartless people or people so different from the rest of society that they are unable to relate to what others are feeling. This is a minor, non-economic quibble so on to substance:

This is great news for many worthy causes. Last year’s top donor, William Barron Hilton of hotel fame, pledged $1.2 billion to his father’s foundation, which supports efforts to prevent blindness worldwide, curb drug abuse among the young and help the homeless, among other things. Other donors targeted cancer research and children’s health clinics.

Yet we’d be so much happier about all the good things America’s moneyed elite pay for if the government made needed public investments.

Non sequitur! From the fact that billions of people donated money it does not follow that it would make us happier if the government took over the management of private charities. The statements are unrelated. Further, who is the “we” in “we’d be so much happier”? It just takes one person to not be happier for the comment to be false (or they could be indifferent). It also takes just one person to not be ""much"" happier as the rest for the comment to be false. Suppose that I wanted to donate $500 to a local church. If we were to socialize/nationalize charity, it’s likely that those $500 will no longer be available to me. Thus, my charity will not receive those funds and there will be little chance that I would be “much happier.”

The snide remarks made by this editorial are symptomatic of a deeper problem. The main assumption is that the state is less likely to make errors than the private sector and thus the government can and should allocate funds; to leave that in the hands of the market would be inefficient and many charities would suffer. These assumptions are wrong.

The assumption that the state is less likely to make errors and therefore this is a preferable arrangement to people donating money on their own is utterly nave. Free exchange is always ex ante beneficial. When two parties willingly enter into an agreement they both assume that they are each going to be better off otherwise they would not do it. If A buys a loaf of bread for $1.50 from B it means that A values the bread more than his $1.50. B, in turn, values the $1.50 more than the bread. Free exchange is always fair. The discovery of errors comes only after an exchange happens. True, it’s possible to expect errors and try to anticipate them, but the knowledge needed to make the calculus of error is based on previous experiences. Only by failing can we determine that failure did in fact occur.

Unfortunately, these insights are bad news for our philistine author. All government action is aggressive; there is no free exchange. Because there is no market, there is no way of knowing whether errors have indeed happened. When the state takes resources and puts it to other uses, it necessarily does so without the consent of those from whom the resources were taken. The conclusion is unmistakable: we are unable to know that the government is making the correct decision. Its decrees do not resemble what people would voluntarily do. Thus, it cannot be conclusively said that ""we’d be so much happier"" if the government invested in charity.

We now continue with the rest of the editorial.

The flip side of American private largess is the stinginess of the public sector. Philanthropic contributions in the United States — about $300 billion in 2006 — probably exceed those of any other country. By contrast, America’s tax take is nearly the lowest in the industrial world. Federal, state and local tax collections amount to just more than 25.5 percent of the nation’s economic output. The Finnish government collects 48.8 percent. As a result, the United States spends less on social programs than virtually every other rich industrial country, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The Finnish government probably has money to build children’s health clinics.

Stinginess of the public sector? Last I heard the budget for the federal government exceeded one trillion dollars. The United States has the largest government in history. Tax collections are barely the tip of the iceberg. The bulk of expenses are financed through debt. I guess the author never thought about this ""detail."" What the author wants is a better arrangement of expenses. In other words, a typical socialist view.

I take issue with ""spends less on social programs"" as if this were a terrible thing. What is an appropriate level of spending? How should spending be determined? Who determines the amount of government spending? How do we determine spending relative to other government programs? How do we know if there is too much charity, or too little? These questions are solved by the market when individuals establish scarcity relationships between resources and, by assigning them relative values, prices arise.

Democratic plunder

We move on to democracy and government spending:

Critics of government spending argue that America’s private sector does a better job making socially necessary investments. But it doesn’t. Public spending is allocated democratically among competing demands. Rich benefactors can spend on anything they want, and they tend to spend on projects close to their hearts.

The private sector is composed of people who voluntarily invest resources where they think they should be spent. A mutually beneficial activity, this is called the market. As I mentioned earlier, the market does indeed do a better job of making the proper socially necessary investments because individuals act to improve their well-being. Their actions reflect a demonstrated preference (and such preference is subjective and ordinal) over other possible courses of action. In the case of monetary exchange — buying and selling goods and services at prices established in units of money — people will spend on things that they think are important to them. Once those needs are satisfied they will move to other things which are less important to them, and so forth.

The state, because it enforces tax laws (and any law, really) at gunpoint, is not engaging in a mutually beneficially manner. People are unable to express their preference. Yet our author contends that ""public spending is allocated democratically among competing demands."" To be fair, that much is true. What is not true is that democracy leads to a better allocation of investments. Democracy is simply a chance to cast a vote for a politician or for an issue; it cannot pretend to be, or do, more than that. It can’t allocate like people do every day when they buy any of the millions of products and services offered on the market.

Let’s imagine that you go to a grocery store where your shopping list is written by popular vote. If you’re lucky you’ll get things that you want. Most of it will consist of items you don’t need. And even if you do see what you need on the list, there’s no guarantee that you’ll have it in the right quantity and quality. To further complicate this scenario, there is only one grocery store available to the entire town. Anyone who dares to open another store or refuses to contribute towards the maintenance of the store will be threatened with jail time, fines or execution. That’s democracy in action.

Finally, the remark about the rich reeks of economic ignorance and contempt for the creation of wealth. Wealth is created in the market as needs are satisfied; when people achieve a goal they are wealthier than they were before — the resources used to achieve those goals were put to good use. The rich are people who obtained their money by serving others. This is no mystery about this. The editorial seems to imply that ""because"" they are rich, they can spend on anything they want. But so can the non-rich. I can spend my money on whatever charity I want, or on any product that I can afford. The implication of the author is that the rich are not choosing correctly and that charity should not depend on them and their whims. As was shown above, however, government intervention is unjust and inefficient.

Taxes and statism

The last part of the short but fallacy-laden editorial consists of a squalid call for further government aggression and a greater destruction of private investment.

A study last year of 8,000 gifts of $1 million or more to 4,000 nonprofits found that 44 percent went to higher education, 16 percent to medical institutions and 12 percent to arts and cultural organizations. Only 5 percent were dedicated to social service groups. Nonprofit groups that rely on the largess of the wealthy are doing fine. The Cincinnati Ballet met its 2007 target of $1.1 million in just five months, the Chronicle said. Giving is down at Lighthouse Ministries, which serves the needy in Florida.

The Cincinnati Ballet received donations of $1.1 million but the Florida charity that serves the needy did not receive as much. Is the author not aware of scarcity? There is a limited amount of resources to achieve our goals. Using a specific resource such as money or time necessarily implies that any alternate use is forfeited. The author assumes that government spending has no cost, or very little, and that the costs born by society have either no consequence or that the consequences are reasonable and fair. However, every penny stolen or extorted as taxation is a penny that could have had a better, more efficient use.

But what about the charity that does not see enough money? What’s so wrong with forcing people to be charitable?

Breaking news: charity requires freedom!

Charity is a virtuous act that requires freedom. Forceful charity does not and cannot exist. If A steals from B to give to C, C might be better off but became so at the expense of B. B is a victim and A is a thief. The exchange between A and B is not legitimate. Not everyone is ""much happier.""

A sordid conclusion

Observe the statist mentality:

Philanthropic contributions are usually tax-free. They directly reduce the government’s ability to engage in public spending. Perhaps the government should demand a role in charities’ allocation of resources in exchange for the tax deduction. Or maybe the deduction should go altogether. Experts estimate that tax breaks motivate 25 percent to 30 percent of contributions.

Government public spending is a parasite that destroys wealth. Deductions are islands of freedom and instead of being happy that they exist, this editorial calls for the elimination of tax deductions. Unbelievable!

And the coup de grâce:

In any event, social needs, like those health clinics, are not about charity. They are a necessity. America needs a government that can and will pay for them.

""They are a necessity."" How was this determined? There are, after all, people who might value entertainment higher than health clinics and would rather have subsidized entertainment over subsidized health care. Who determines what a necessity is? Who determines the quantity and quality of the products and services needed? And finally, how will the factors of production be chosen from possibly many alternatives? Some would say that democracy answers those questions. As I show above, however, democracy is not Pareto efficient. On the contrary, democracy and income redistribution guarantees that there will be winners and losers — exactly the opposite of the market.

Ultimately, this NYT editorial is at best confused, and evil at worst. What the author describes is not charity but redistribution of wealth under the guise of charity.

The horrifying attitude exemplified here and, sadly, almost everywhere else, contributes to poverty and disrupts economic growth. Stop believing this nonsense. Charity does not begin in Washington. Washington destroys it.

It covers faux pas like, say, mounting your horse indoors rather than outdoors or stealing the silverware at a banquet, and delineates who gets to urinate in the dining room (only the host, obviously). Its advice is often timeless, such as in this case:

If the wife of your lord turns her eyes on you too often andwantonly looses shameful fires against you, letting youknow that she wants to have intercourse with you; if she says,“The whole household and your lord, my husband,shall serve you for ever, you alone shall be my darling, youshall rule everything, everything which belongs to yourlord shall be open to you”… consult me, my son; what Icounsel is planted in your heart; between two evils, choosethe lesser evil; your safer plan is to feign illness, nerve-racking diseases, to go away sensibly and prudently.

And fullness of the calves and ankles denotes foolishness and shamelessness. Likewise too full thighs show weakness and softness.

Among his list of the weaknesses of women is one item, though, that sounds familiar:

Woman is also such a slave to her belly that there is nothing she would be ashamed to assent to if she were assured of a fine meal, and no matter how much she has she never has any hope that she can satisfy her appetite when she is hungry; she never invites anybody to eat with her, but when she eats she always seeks out hidden and retired places and she usually likes to eat more than normal.

The similarity this description bears to today’s popular Everywoman characters like Liz Lemon is pretty striking. Although the advice here is that a woman will do anything for a meal, the second part of this statement shows us something timeless. As misleading as Capellanus’s other judgements on women can be, this observation seems to be directly alluding to how, almost a millennium later, a girl’s best friend is often a whole family-sized thing of snacks, eaten alone in bed.

After my article ""Thanks to Mothers against Drunk Driving, I’m a Dangerous Driver"" was published last week, I found out that I am one of the most vile, heartless and dangerous people to ever walk the face of the Earth. I myself was unaware that I was such a dastardly scoundrel, but many, many readers were gracious enough to send me what amounted to a mountain of emails to clue me in to this important fact.

Why am I such a dastardly scoundrel? No, I have never killed or robbed anyone. Nor have I ever participated in genocide, torture or rape. Instead, as I found out last week, I am one of the most dastardly scoundrels in the world simply because I think that drunk driving ought to be legalized.

For the benefit of those of you who think that men like me are confirmed scoundrels simply because we believe that drunk driving ought to be legalized, I have compiled a list of fallacies that are often employed to defend the prohibition on drunk driving. I do this because I hope to be able to show that you need to make better arguments in order to show that drunk-driving laws actually do what they are intended to do, and better arguments to demonstrate that drunk driving is any different than, say, driving without your glasses. In other words, if you think drunk driving ought to be illegal, then please provide us scoundrels of the world with an actual, non-fallacious argument to that effect.

The Argumentum ad Misericordiam Fallacy

The argumentum ad misericordiam fallacy occurs whenever an argument contains an appeal to an emotion that is irrelevant to the actual argument under discussion. This is by far the most widely-employed fallacy whenever the topic of drunk driving is discussed. (Peruse MADD’s website for two minutes for confirmation of this.) The fallacy usually surfaces in something like the following forms, (and which are actual replies to my article):

""I sincerely hope that no one you know or love is killed by a drunk driver…You might then change your mind about whether prevention is better than punishment.""

Or:

""We are talking about the one thing that cannot be replaced.""

The reason why these sorts of arguments are instances of the argumentum ad misericordiam fallacy, and are thus improper, is that they appeal to emotions that have absolutely nothing to do with the argument under discussion. The debate over legalizing drunk driving is not between those who hate human life and those who cherish it, or between those who want people to die and those who want to save lives. Instead, the debate revolves around whether drunk-driving laws actually do what they’re claimed to do, and whether they are consistent with the principles upon which law and ethics are based. Indeed, both of my articles claim precisely that drunk-driving laws do not work as they are claimed to work. As such, it is totally irrelevant whether or not I might change my mind if someone I know is killed by a drunk driver, or whether human life is irreplaceable. Either my arguments are sound, or they’re not — and appeals to irrelevant emotional responses cannot help us determine whether my argument is sound. For example, if we were having a discussion about whether current drug laws actually do what they’re claimed to do, it would be totally fallacious for me to shout out ""Think of the children!"" and think that I had somehow shown that drug prohibition is efficacious. On the contrary, I would simply have shown myself to be an ignoramus.

It is important for drunk-driving prohibitionists to recognize, moreover, that these appeals to emotion cut both ways. That is, we anti-prohibitionists can also appeal to emotions. We can point out that these ruthless laws have the effect of causing an extreme amount of pain for those who are persecuted by them. People who are pulled over and charged with drunk driving, without having caused even the slightest injury to anyone else, will have experienced an extreme amount of pain as a result. (And those who do cause harm can be charged with negligent manslaughter even in the absence of drunk-driving laws.) They can be fined, jailed, forced to take farcical MADD classes, serve ""community service,"" be refused employment, and even sent to prison! As such, we opponents of drunk-driving prohibition are only standing up for this horribly oppressed, robbed and incarcerated group of men and women who never even hurt anyone else. Whenever a drunk-driving prohibitionist declares ""People’s lives are priceless…,"" we opponents of drunk-driving prohibition will reply, ""Exactly! That’s why we ought not to inflict serious harm on innocent people who have harmed no other people!""

In sum, if you write to me to call me a scoundrel this time, don’t think you’ve proven anything if you drag some irrelevant emotional appeal into the discussion. Focus on my arguments instead.

The Ad Hominem Fallacy

The ad hominem fallacy occurs whenever an argument contains an irrelevant attack on a person’s character. In the context of the debate over drunk driving, this fallacy usually surfaces as an accusation that a proponent of the legalization of drunk driving is a ""drunk."" Here is a classic, if somewhat trite, example:

""Your opinion matches every other drunk I’ve known, in that you think that you are able to handle yourself behind the wheel.""

The reason why this sort of an attack is fallacious is that my personal character has absolutely nothing to do with my arguments. I might be a drunk, coke-head, hippie, serial killer, but these character traits have nothing to do with my arguments that drunk-driving laws have the exact opposite effect from what most people believe. Again, the arguments are either sound or they’re not — regardless of whether I am a ""drunk."" Hence, if you want to demonstrate that my arguments are not sound, you had better provide something more than an accusation that I am a ""drunk."" (I find it fascinating, moreover, that anyone could determine that I’m a ""drunk"" based purely upon my article. I suggest that these puritans spend a bit of time in the company of South Africans, New Zealanders, Aussies, Brits, Scots, the Irish, etc. before they call me a drunk!)

So, don’t think you’re going to change my mind about my arguments if you can only resort to name-calling. Grow up, and focus on my arguments instead.

The Circular Argument Fallacy

The circular argument fallacy (or, “begging the question”) occurs whenever someone assumes the very thing they are attempting to prove in their argument. In the context of the discussion over drunk-driving legalization, this fallacy usually arises when prohibitionists start talking about the law. For example, when discussing whether drunk-driving laws actually work, the prohibitionist sometimes argues that:

""We have laws in this country governing driving. Like stop signs. If you break the law by driving through a stop sign, you get a ticket. The same is, and ought to be, true of drunk drivers. They break the law, and should be punished for it.""

The problem with this sort of argument is that is assumes from the outset that drunk driving ought to be illegal — which is the very thing the prohibitionist is attempting to prove! That is, the prohibitionist has used his conclusion as a basis for drawing that conclusion; i.e., the argument is circular. If you want to demonstrate that drunk driving ought to be illegal, then you have to provide an argument to that effect. You cannot simply assume that ought to be illegal throughout your entire argument, because you will be committing a serious logical fallacy. Similarly, you cannot argue that ""because it’s the law, that means it’s wrong,"" because you need to prove to us anti-prohibitionists that it ought to be the law in the first place!

Quod Nimis Probat, Nihil Probat (What Proves Too Much, Proves Nothing)

Another common logical error committed by drunk-driving prohibitionists is to present arguments that clearly prove too much. That is, in their attempt to single out and vilify drunk drivers as absolute scum of the Earth, they draw conclusions that imply absurd consequences if they were taken to their logical conclusion. For example, prohibitionists often defend prohibition in the following manner:

""Am I to understand that you support WAITING until someone DIES to object to another’s irresponsibility? I find that simplistic, foolish, and unacceptable. The reason I do is that the life lost is irreplaceable!""

The problem with this sort of argument is that it proves far, far too much (in addition to making an irrelevant appeal to emotion). For, this argument could be extended to all aspects of human life, and virtually everything people do would be punished by ruthless laws — regardless of whether people actually hurt anyone. This argument would apply, for example, to people who drive without their glasses (and who currently only get a minor ticket if pulled over, instead of a stay in jail), people who text on their phones while driving, people who ride their bikes with bad brakes, people who work with flammable liquids around other people, et cetera ad infinitum. In fact, if the argument were taken to its logical conclusion, every single human action would be punished by draconian laws and jack-booted policemen, since people can, and do, negligently kill other people in virtually every situation where men encounter one another on this planet. The argument does not give us any reason why we ought to single out drunk drivers to punish so ruthlessly, when we let other negligent people totally off the hook — like people who drive without their glasses.

(In this connection, I’ve always been rather perplexed that Mothers against Drunk Driving chooses to hunt and crucify only drunk drivers, rather than negligent drivers generally. These mothers don’t care about people who are killed through other types of negligent driving? Why don’t they hunt down Grandpa like a wild beast when he kills someone after forgetting to put on his glasses?)

Conclusion

The argument for legalizing drunk driving is based upon two important insights: 1) as I have attempted to demonstrate in my articles, (again, see here and here), drunk-driving laws do not actually do what they are almost universally believed to do; namely, make people safer drivers, and 2) drunk driving is not any different than any other negligent action behind the wheel (like driving while tired, angry, senile, or without one’s glasses), and thus ought to only be punished when that negligent behavior harms another person (again, see here and here). Furthermore, the argument against drunk-driving laws is based upon the observation that we already have laws to punish people when they harm other people through negligent or intentional action; i.e., negligent manslaughter and murder laws. The clincher is that drunk driving is not even remotely as great a danger as people almost universally believe that it is. For proof of this, watch Jeff Brown’s excellent YouTube video discussing the statistics of drunk driving.

I wonder whether they also want to import European policies that created barbaric extremism among its Muslim population.

France’s recent tragedy is not surprising, given some of its policies that are not widely publicized abroad. France has no-go zones, which are officially called “zones urbaines sensibles,” or sensitive urban zones, where police are reluctant to go. Some of these zones are dominated by Islamic extremists. According to some reports, there is hardly a city in France that does not have at least one ZUS. It is estimated that there are more than 750 such zones in France. According to The Washington Times, “France has Europe’s largest population of Muslims, some of whom talk openly of ruling the country one day and casting aside Western legal systems for harsh, Islam-based Shariah.” It appears that much of France’s Muslim population has no intention of joining the French culture. Many French Muslims are hellbent on importing the failed components of their motherland, such as Shariah, the subjugation of women, suppression of free speech and honor killings.

But France is not alone in tolerating people who have little desire to abandon the culture from which they fled. Ingrid Carlqvist has written an article titled “Sweden Descends into Anarchy” (http://tinyurl.com/pdk3lta). Carlqvist says, “Once upon a time, there was a safe welfare state called Sweden, where people rarely locked their doors.” She adds: “Since the Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish, crime has exploded. Violent crime has increased by over 300 percent, and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472 percent.”

One Swedish policeman says, “The situation is slipping from our grasp,” referring to some no-go areas, such as Tensta and Rinkeby. “If we’re in pursuit of a vehicle, it can evade us by driving to certain neighborhoods where a lone patrol car simply cannot follow because we’ll get pelted by rocks and even face riots.

These are no-go zones. We simply can’t go there.” As a result of the increasing danger, Swedes are arming themselves in unprecedented numbers and sales of home alarm systems are booming.

Elliot Friedland, writing for the Clarion Project, has an article titled “Belgian Government Admits It Has Lost Control of No-Go Zone.” Security and Home Affairs Minister Jan Jambon says the government does not “have control of the situation in Molenbeek.” Molenbeek, a district of Brussels, has been referred to as “Europe’s jihadi central.” Race & Economics: How ...

Two of the terrorists who carried out the recent attacks in Paris were found to be from Molenbeek. Terrorist plots connected to this neighborhood include the 2001 assassination of anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Massoud; the 2004 Madrid train bombings, which killed 191 people; the 2014 attack on a Jewish museum in Brussels; the January attack on a kosher grocery in Paris after the Charlie Hebdo shootings; and the August attack on a Paris-bound train, in which an Islamic terrorist was overpowered by three Americans.

There are zones where the government has lost control in Germany, England and most other European countries, too. Viktor Orban, prime minister of Hungary, explained the situation confronting Europeans: “For us today, at stake are Europe, the lifestyle of European citizens, European values, the survival or disappearance of European nations and, more precisely formulated, their transformation beyond recognition. Today the question is not merely in what kind of a Europe we would like to live but whether everything we understand as Europe will exist at all.”

Europe provides a valuable lesson for Americans. Most Americans, including me, welcome people to our country who come here, as immigrants have in the past, to become Americans. We don’t welcome people who wish to import the failed culture from which they fled. We could extend the welcome mat even further if we abandoned the welfare state. We have far too many Americans living off the earnings of others. We don’t need to encourage others to do the same.

374493,"Films are an art form. Even the earliest forms, starting with nickelodeons in the 18th century, were meant to elicit some kind of emotional response from their audience. This emotional response has to be specific, though. If a filmmaker made what they thought was a stirring emotional drama, but it ends up hitting none of its intended beats, then it is considered a failure. I think the word “failure” is completely subjective. Avatar is the highest grossing movie of all-time, meaning it was obviously successful, but I thought it was pretty lame.

The highest praise that I can give any movie is that I was thoroughly entertained by it. I can love a movie like The Godfather, but only watch it maybe a couple of times in my life, but I’ve seen Big Trouble in Little China probably a hundred times, and it is only because I find it infinitely easier and more fun to watch. Even though a movie doesn’t do well at the box-office, or with critics, doesn’t mean that it doesn’t have some kind of huge intrinsic value. Going as far as we can to that side of the spectrum, we reach a wonderful kind of movie genre, the so-bad-it’s-good variety. I’ll go one step further and say that these are movies that are so bad that they are just hilarious. Hilariously bad, but endlessly enjoyable. These are movies I can watch over and over again, preferably in a group of like-minded friends.

So here is the Top 10 So-Bad-They-Are-Hilarious Movies. List courtesy of Cultural Atrocities.

10 Mosquito

One of the things you’ll notice about this list is that most of these are either horror movies or action movies. It makes complete sense, since these are the genres with the most action and have the most opportunity for awful special effects. The ’70s, ’80s and ’90s are a goldmine for unintentional comedy. The ’80s, in particular, were just a perfect storm of cheap, practical effects, cheesy acting and cultural madness. The best part, though, is how innocent most of it feels, like they are making these terrible movies but there is an underlying love for the crap that they are making.

Which brings me to Mosquito. The first thing that I will point out is that every single thing in this movie lends itself to the ’80s. Everything. Then when it is over you find out that, whoops, it was actually made in 1995. There are a few movies on this list that just have ’80s written all over them, but are actually firmly planted in the middle of the ’90s. This makes for a weird movie-going experience. You’re watching it and reveling in the bad blue screen Mosquito effects, but appreciating the effort involved for the time it was made, and then afterwards you realize it was made in 1995, and you could make better horror movie effects at a mall kiosk.

Asheton and Gunnar Hanson (Leatherface from the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre).

Golden Moments: Any mosquito attack scene is great. When Gunnar Hanson picks up that chainsaw it gives you B-movie fandom chills. The bad acting by the main couple is hilariously awful. Junior’s eyeball explosions.

9 Starcrash

In the ’70s, every studio executive was looking for the next Star Wars. And why wouldn’t they be? It was a glorified independent movie made on the cheap that became one of the most successful franchises of all-time. Enter the Italians. Writer/Director Luigi Cozzi had this script in development years before Luke and Han raided the Death Star, but it was only after the success of Star Wars that he was able to get financing for this film. The only caveat? It had to be almost exactly like Star Wars, and Cozzi’s script had to undergo a couple of changes.

The actual plot is a mess. It’s more of an enjoy-the-ride type of experience. The visuals though, more than make up for the absence of plot. This may be one of the coolest-looking low budget films ever. Everything pops onscreen, from the bright colors to the ridiculous outfits to the stop-motion effects (a la Harryhausen) that we’ll probably never see again in any current film releases. The score also gets major props. Sure it’s a Star Wars rip-off, but there have been far worse Star Wars rip-offs that were made, for far more money.

Last but not least, we have to talk about the cast. Caroline Munro takes the lead as Stellastar, and while her acting chops leave a little to be desired, she makes up for it by being really hot and wearing a bikini for most of the movie. Next we have Marjoe Gortner as Akton, maybe one of the most interesting guys ever. He got into the national spotlight as a child preacher, and then went on to work in both the recording and film industry. Rounding out the I-Recognize-That-Guy files are David Hasselhoff as a Han Solo clone and Christopher Plummer as the humbly-titled Emperor of the First Circle of the Universe.

Golden Moments: The Foghorn Leghorn-inspired robot is a real treat. Akton gaining superpowers as the film goes on without any explanation. Any and all of the special effects.

8 Ticks

Ah, Ticks. I saw this movie when I was 11 and I still understood how glorious it was. When the internet took off, it gave me and other little pop-culture junkies the opportunity to hunt down those random movies that we watched on HBO at 2am when we were younger. Also known by its alternate title “Infested”, Ticks was directed by Tony Randel. No, not Tony Randall, esteemed actor, but the guy who directed Hellraiser 2 (which also totally rules).

Ticks is about a group of violent/anti-social/troubled teens being brought on a camp retreat by their psychiatrists/counselors. Included in this group is a post-child actor Seth Green, a thugged-out Alfonso “Carlton” Ribeiro, Mickey “The Monkey” Dolenz’s daughter Ami (star of all sorts of shitty movies), and some other social archetypes. Their counselors are esteemed actors Peter Scolari from Bosom Buddies and Rosalind Allen, who you might remember as the girl that George Costanza pretended to be a marine biologist for so he could bang. Joining this ensemble are a rich, sneezy guy and his redneck buddy, and Clint Howard as a gross guy (typecast much?).

Like Mosquito, the wood ticks eat some steroids and grow to the size of small crabs that are ridiculously fast. It’s a slow burn at first with the Ticks somehow choosing not to attack all at once, but by the end there are thousands of them raining down through the cabin’s ceiling onto our survivors. If you don’t get itchy and check your skin every once in a while then I’m not sure if we’re watching the same movie.

Golden Moments: Every scene with Carlton, including the climax where he turns into a tick the size of a crocodile. Seth Green’s lit broom throw. Clint Howard’s face exploding.

271036,"I’ve always hated Rudy Giuliani — but never more than now.

His face fills the screen on every tv channel. Even watching the World Series on the tube provides no sanctuary. Between every inning, there he was, grinning, wearing his silly Yankee baseball cap, seated next to one of my other favorites, warmonger Senator John McCain.

The soon-to-be ex-mayor raises the temperature and gets a standing ovation every time he enters a room. Cameras pass over presidents and governors to focus on Rudy when he comes on stage. He seems ready for sainthood. It’s enough to make you sick.

How did all this happen?

On that horrid day in September, Giuliani was trapped in a corridor in one of the World Trade Center buildings and was almost a casualty. This close brush with death energized him, propelling him tirelessly from every newly discovered horror to the next. Rudy was everywhere. The media, impressed, anointed him the icon of the disaster: the brash, bona fide New Yorker with his bona fide New York accent became a stand-in symbol for the city’s courage and resolution.

The shell-shocked Gothamites were easy to persuade. Here was an untested, verbally bumbling president in the White House and a fast-talking New Yorker, both doing terrific jobs, weren’t they? With each passing day, the mythology fed upon itself, and King Rudy reigned supreme.

Actually, Rudy Giuliani doesn’t represent the spirit of New York City. Sanctified by the media, the only thing Giuliani represents is the government itself. To listen to the media, one would think that the only casualty of September 11 was the government. Giuliani filled the role of a functionary who roamed from one funeral to the next, a sort of toastmaster general helping bury New York’s uniformed dignitaries.

It was a top-down event. The mayor represented the upper echelons of the city’s apparatus, with an occasional moment of grieving for the hardworking, tragic victims from the real world of commerce.

Politically, Giuliani is like the horror film monster who refuses to stay dead. His prostate surgery forced him to drop out of the much anticipated senate race against Hillary. Pundits have little doubt, however, that Rudy would have fared no better against La Clinton than poor Lazio. (Clinton garnered 55% to Lazio’s 44%.)

Even term limits — ordinarily a stake in the political heart — were almost side-stepped by Rudy. For a brief moment there was serious consideration to change the constitution of New York state allowing him to run again for mayor of the Big Apple. Fortunately, the New York pols were not ready for dictator Rudy.

Murray Rothbard used to say whenever a name suddenly becomes household, that he or she didn’t drop down from the sky.

Rudolph Giuliani certainly didn’t drop down from the sky. He came from Brooklyn.

Rudy was an ambitious lad who once considered entering the priesthood. His father, Harold, had a criminal record before Rudy was born.

In author Wayne Barrett’s book, Rudy!: An Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani, he says, ""The father he celebrated so often was a pathological predator. His extended family harbored a junkie, a crooked cop and a murky mob wing. He dissolved his first marriage with a lie so he could appear Catholic when he remarried. The very personal jewelry his first wife found in her bedroom wasn’t hers."" (Read the book for the answer to that and a lot more.)

In 1983 Rudy was appointed US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. His record 4,152 convictions with a mere 25 reversals is a testament to his zeal for the job.

Giuliani did not accumulate this glittering record on behalf of the citizens of the Southern District. He was motivated purely by political ambition.

As a prosecutor he employed ruthless tactics such as seizing prominent stockbrokers and traders from the floor of the exchanges and dragging them away in handcuffs with the television cameras already in place and rolling.

In his most famous case, against stock market innovator Michael Milken of Drexel Burnham, Giuliani used the threat of the Racketeering-Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO) statutes — which were so draconian that Milken had no choice but to make a deal with the federal government.

Prosecuting attorneys are never lovable, but Rudy Giuliani was despicable.

We all hope you recover from your recent surgery and that your personal life stays out of the gossip column on Page Six of the New York Post.

As far as I’m concerned, Rudy, I’d be relieved to see you relegated to that insignificant never-never land occupied by ex-New York city mayors.

Perhaps you saw the photo. It showed Barack Obama with a group of his supporters holding signs bearing the word ""change."" And news analysts informed us that one reason the Clinton campaign faltered (they apparently don’t consider the possibility that the people simply didn’t want her) was that she underestimated the public’s desire for ""change.""

I doubt it. In the first place, the last thing any establishment-approved politician would desire is change. In the second, if the people actually wanted change, they could have picked Ron Paul, who would bring about real, not simply rhetorical, change.

For instance, what ""change"" has Obama proposed, which would not be likely to occur under a Clinton presidency? Can his supporters actually cite specific significant changes that he would effect when elected? Would he, for example, abolish the Federal Reserve? Would he ""privatize"" social security? Would he, in contrast to Clinton’s proposal to broaden Medicare, recommend its abolition? Would he do away with myriad alphabet agencies? Of course not. Neither would she.

Moreover, the idea that the people can bring about some change in government by voting is mistaken, if not downright false. Is it reasonable to believe that the largest corporation in the country, if not the world, is going to put its leadership positions up for grabs every few years? I realize that the shareholders of corporations are occasionally asked to vote for members of the board of directors, but in my (admittedly very limited) experience, the candidates are simply shown to us, with a brief biographical note. I can’t recall any instance of a candidate indicating what, if anything, he was going to change if elected. And if a newly elected CEO were to take the company in a direction that shareholders disliked, they could sell their shares. If the President takes the country in a direction that I dislike, can I sell my shares? And, of course, I became a shareholder (in the ""private sector"") in the first place voluntarily, and can dispose of my shares at any time.

If I vote for a candidate who promises change, but fails to provide it, can I call for a vote to oust him? If, once in office, he lies to us, and makes us think the situation vis–vis the corporation is rosier than it actually is, can we indict him, la Enron?

The only change we can expect from any new president is a continuation, perhaps at an accelerated rate, toward totalitarianism. The people who make changes in government policy and basic philosophy are behind the scenes. We are treated (if that’s the word) to the spectacle of political campaigns as part of a psychological exercise whose purpose is to provide the illusion of choice. This culminates in an election in which people pick a president, senator, etc. But the outcome is unimportant, in almost all cases, because any of the candidates is acceptable to the government’s owners and operators.

If people want change, let them stay home on election day. The outcome will be no different, but the rulers might get the message that people no longer want to participate in the charade of voting. Perhaps — and wouldn’t this be wonderful!! — they might even get the idea that the people have become fed up with the very concept of government!

Yes, Vlad, we have.

Consider the questions that have convulsed this city since the Trump triumph, and raised talk of impeachment.

Did Trump collude with Russians to hack the DNC emails and move the goods to WikiLeaks, thus revealing the state secret that DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz was putting the screws to poor Bernie Sanders?

If not Trump himself, did campaign aides collude with the KGB?

Now, given that our NSA and CIA seemingly intercept everything Russians say to Americans, why is our fabled FBI, having investigated for a year, unable to give us a definitive yes or no?

The snail’s pace of the FBI investigation explains Trump’s frustration. What explains the FBI’s torpor? If J. Edgar Hoover had moved at this pace, John Dillinger would have died of old age. Nixonu2019s White Hous... Patrick J. Buchanan Check Amazon for Pricing.

We hear daily on cable TV of the “Trump-Russia” scandal. Yet, no one has been charged with collusion, and every intelligence official, past or prevent, who has spoken out has echoed ex-acting CIA Director Mike Morrell:

“On the question of the Trump campaign conspiring with the Russians here, there is smoke, but there is no fire, at all. … There’s no little campfire, there’s no little candle, there’s no spark.”

Where are the criminals? Where is the crime?

As for the meetings between Gen. Mike Flynn, Jared Kushner, Sen. Jeff Sessions and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, it appears that Trump wanted a “back channel” to Putin so he could honor his commitment to seek better relations with Russia.

Given the Russophobia rampant here, that makes sense. And while it appears amateurish that Flynn would use Russian channels of communication, what is criminal about this?

Putin is not Stalin. Soviet divisions are not sitting on the Elbe. The Cold War is over. And many presidents have used back channels. Woodrow Wilson sent Col. Edward House to talk to the Kaiser and the Brits. FDR ran messages to Churchill through Harry Hopkins.

The Greatest Comeback:... Patrick J. Buchanan Best Price: $$7.10 Buy New $$7.99 (as of 02:00 EST - Details) As for Trump asking Director James Comey to cut some slack for Flynn, it is understandable in human terms. Flynn had been a loyal aide and friend and Trump had to feel rotten about having to fire the man.

So, what is really going on here?

All the synthetic shock over what Kushner or Sessions said to Kislyak aside, this city’s hatred for President Trump, and its fanatic determination to bring him down in disgrace, predates his presidency.

For Trump ran in 2016 not simply as the Republican alternative. He presented his candidacy as a rejection, a repudiation of the failed elites, political and media, of both parties. Americans voted in 2016 not just for a change in leaders but for a revolution to overthrow a ruling regime.

Thus this city has never reconciled itself to Trump’s victory, and the president daily rubs their noses in their defeat with his tweets.

Seeking a rationale for its rejection, this city has seized upon that old standby. We didn’t lose! The election was stolen in a vast conspiracy, an “act of war” against America, an assault upon “our democracy,” criminal collusion between the Kremlin and the Trumpites.

Hence, Trump is an illegitimate president, and it is the duty of brave citizens of both parties to work to remove the usurper. A Republic, Not an Emp... Patrick J. Buchanan Buy New $$20.95 (as of 07:40 EST - Details)

The city seized upon a similar argument in 1968, when Richard Nixon won, because it was said he had colluded to have South Vietnam’s president abort Lyndon Johnson’s new plan to bring peace to Southeast Asia in the final hours of that election.

Then, as now, the “t” word, treason, was trotted out.

Attempts to overturn elections where elites are repudiated are not uncommon in U.S. history. Both Nixon and Reagan, after 49-state landslides, were faced with attempts to overturn the election results.

With Nixon in Watergate, the elites succeeded. With Reagan in Iran-Contra, they almost succeeded in destroying that great president as he was ending the Cold War in a bloodless victory for the West.

After Lincoln’s assassination, President Andrew Johnson sought to prevent Radical Republicans from imposing a ruthless Reconstruction on a defeated and devastated South.

The Radicals enacted the Tenure of Office Act, stripping Johnson of his authority to remove any member of the Cabinet without Senate permission. Johnson defied the Radicals and fired their agent in the Cabinet, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.

“Tennessee” Johnson was impeached, and missed conviction by one vote. John F. Kennedy, in his 1956 book, called the senator who had voted to save Johnson a “Profile in Courage.”

If Trump is brought down on the basis of what Putin correctly labels “nonsense,” this city will have executed a nonviolent coup against a constitutionally elected president. Such an act would drop us into the company of those Third World nations where such means are the customary ways that corrupt elites retain their hold on power.

225984,"Scientists have discovered a crack in the Earth’s crust that threatens to pull North America and Europe closer together and cause the Atlantic Ocean to vanish in about 220 million years.

Researchers at the University of Lisbon have created a new map of the seafloor, off the coast of Iberia – the region of Europe that includes Portugal and Spain – and the results show the beginnings of a new subduction zone.

National Geographic reported on the new data surrounding the subduction zones, and what could happen when the tectonic plates – the large rock slabs that make up the Earth’s crust – crash into one another.

The edge of the heavier plate slides, or subducts, below the lighter plate.

It then melts back into the Earth’s mantle – the layer just below the crust.

The discovery of this new subduction zone, published on June 6 in the journal Geology, could signal the start of an extended cycle that fuses continents together into a single landmass – or ‘supercontinent’ – and closes our oceans.

This breakup and reformation of supercontinents has happened at least three times during Earth’s approximately four-billion-year history.

Speaking with National Geographic, the study’s first author João Duarte said that Earth’s continents could ‘look very much like the Pangea,’ in the far future, referring to a supercontinent that existed about 200 million years ago.

The newly discovered subduction zone is located in the Atlantic Ocean about 120 miles off the southwest coast of Portugal.

It’s composed of six different segments that span a total distance of about 186 miles.

The subduction zone is actually a new crack in the Eurasian plate – one of about a dozen tectonic plates that make up the Earth’s crust.

The Eurasian plate contains all of Europe and most of Asia.

‘In this case, the Eurasia plate is breaking in two,’ Duarte said to National Geographic.

Scientists have long suspected that a new subduction zone was forming near the western margin of the Eurasian plate, off the coast of Portugal.

The region has long been the site of significant earthquake activity, including an 8.7-magnitude quake in 1755 that devastated Lisbon.

This kind of tectonic movement is also at work on the Pacific ‘ring of fire’, located at the borders of the Pacific plate and other major tectonic plates.

The Ring of Fire gets its name because it is composed of over 75 per cent of the world’s active and dormant volcanoes.

It is also the site of the Tohoku earthquke in 2011, and it was the undersea location of plate movement that caused of the devastating tsunami.

741262,"While the Koran Calls for Violence, The Bible Is Even Worse … Calling for Genocide

Christians and Jews rightly point out that the Koran is a violent text which calls on Muslims to attack “unbelievers”.

But they fail to see that the Bible is at least as violent.

NPR noted in 2010:

Religion historian Philip Jenkins decided to compare the brutality quotient of the Quran and the Bible.

“Much to my surprise, the Islamic scriptures in the Quran were actually far less bloody and less violent than those in the Bible,” Jenkins says.

Jenkins is a professor at Penn State University and author of two books dealing with the issue: the recently published Jesus Wars, and Dark Passages , which has not been published but is already drawing controversy.

Violence in the Quran, he and others say, is largely a defense against attack.

“By the standards of the time, which is the 7th century A.D., the laws of war that are laid down by the Quran are actually reasonably humane,” he says. “Then we turn to the Bible, and we actually find something that is for many people a real surprise. There is a specific kind of warfare laid down in the Bible which we can only call genocide.”

It is called herem, and it means total annihilation. Consider the Book of 1 Samuel, when God instructs King Saul to attack the Amalekites: “And utterly destroy all that they have, and do not spare them,” God says through the prophet Samuel. “But kill both man and woman, infant and nursing child, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.”

When Saul failed to do that, God took away his kingdom.

“In other words,” Jenkins says, “Saul has committed a dreadful sin by failing to complete genocide. And that passage echoes through Christian history. It is often used, for example, in American stories of the confrontation with Indians — not just is it legitimate to kill Indians, but you are violating God’s law if you do not.”

Jenkins notes that the history of Christianity is strewn with herem. During theCrusades in the Middle Ages, the Catholic popes declared the Muslims Amalekites. In the great religious wars in the 16th, 17th and 19th centuries, Protestants and Catholics each believed the other side were the Amalekites and should be utterly destroyed.",lewrockwell.com,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
743790,"Green guru and geophysicist James Lovelock, considered one of the pioneering scientists of the 20th century, has officially turned his back on man-made global warming claims and the green movement’s focus on renewable energy. Lovelock conceived the Gaia theory back in the 1970s, describing the Earth’s biosphere as “an active, adaptive control system able to maintain the earth in homeostasis.”

In an April 3, 2014 BBC TV interview, Lovelock has come out swinging at his fellow environmentalists, accusing the new UN IPCC global warming report of plagiarizing his now retracted climate claims from his 2006 book ‘The Revenge of Gaia.’

“The last IPCC report is very similar to the (now retracted) statements I made in my book about 8 years ago, called The Revenge of Gaia. It’s almost as if they’ve copied it,” Lovelock told BBC Newsnight television program on April 3.

BBC interviewer Jeremy Paxman noted to Lovelock during the April 3 program: ”Sure. But you then, after publishing these apocalyptic predictions, you then retracted them.”

The newly skeptical Lovelock responded: ”Well, that’s my privilege. You see, I’m an independent scientist. I’m not funded by some government department or commercial body or anything like that. If I make a mistake, then I can go public with it. And you have to, because it is only by making mistakes that you can move ahead.”

Lovelock dismissed the entire basis for global warming concerns in his BBC television interview. “Take this climate matter everybody is thinking about. They all talk, they pass laws, they do things, as if they knew what was happening. I don’t think anybody really knows what’s happening. They just guess. And a whole group of them meet together and encourage each other’s guesses,” Lovelock explained.

A UN Lead Author, Dr. Richard Tol, joined Lovelock this week in slamming the UN and had his name removed from the IPCC report.

90596,"Recently by Chris Martenson: Fukushima Update: A Very Bad Situation

One of the conclusions that I try to coax, lead, and/or nudge people towards is acceptance of the fact that the economy can’t be fixed. By this I mean that the old regime of general economic stability and rising standards of living fueled by excessive credit are a thing of the past. At least they are for the debt-encrusted developed nations over the short haul  and, over the long haul, across the entire soon-to-be energy-starved globe.

he sooner we can accept that idea and make other plans the better. To paraphrase a famous saying, Anything that can’t be fixed, won’t.

The basis for this view stems from understanding that debt-based money systems operate best when they can grow exponentially forever. Of course, nothing can, which means that even without natural limits, such systems are prone to increasingly chaotic behavior, until the money that undergirds them collapses into utter worthlessness, allowing the cycle to begin anew.

All economic depressions share the same root cause. Too much credit that does not lead to enhanced future cash flows is extended. In other words, this means lending without regard for the ability of the loan to repay both the principal and interest from enhanced production; money is loaned for consumption, and poor investment decisions are made. Eventually gravity takes over, debts are defaulted upon, no more borrowers can be found, and the system is rather painfully scrubbed clean. It’s a very normal and usual process.

When we bring in natural limits, however, (such as is the case for petroleum right now), what emerges is a forcing function that pushes a debt-based, exponential money system over the brink all that much faster and harder.

But for the moment, let’s ignore the imminent energy crisis. On a pure debt, deficit, and liability basis, the US, much of Europe, and Japan are all well past the point of no return. No matter what policy tweaks, tax and benefit adjustments, or spending cuts are made  individually or in combination  nothing really pencils out to anything that remotely resembles a solution that would allow us to return to business as usual.

At the heart of it all, the developed nations blew themselves a gigantic credit bubble, which fed all kinds of grotesque distortions, of which housing is perhaps the most visible poster child. However, outsized government budgets and promises, overconsumption of nearly everything imaginable, bloated college tuition costs, and rising prices in healthcare utterly disconnected from economics are other symptoms, too. This report will examine the deficits, debts, and liabilities in such a way as to make the case that there’s no possibility of a return of generally rising living standards for most of the developed world. A new era is upon us. There’s always a slight chance , should some transformative technology come along, like another Internet, or perhaps the equivalent of another Industrial Revolution, but no such catalysts are on the horizon, let alone at the ready.

At the end, we will tie this understanding of the debt predicament to the energy situation raised in my prior report to fully develop the conclusion that we can  and really should  seriously entertain the premise that there’s just no way for all the debts to be paid back. There are many implications to this line of thinking, not the least of which is the risk that the debt-based, fiat money system itself is in danger of failing.

Too Little Debt! (or, Your One Chart That Explains Everything)

Note: this next section is an excerpt from a recent Martenson Blog entry, so if this seems familiar to any site members, it’s because you’ve seen it before.

If I were to be given just one chart, by which I had to explain everything about why Bernanke’s printed efforts have so far failed to actually cure anything and why I am pessimistic that further efforts will fall short, it is this one:

There’s a lot going on in this deceptively simple chart so let’s take it one step at a time. First, ""Total Credit Market Debt"" is everything  financial sector debt, government debt (federal, state, and local), household debt, and corporate debt  and that is the bold red line (data from the Federal Reserve).

Next, if we start in January 1970 and ask the question, ""How long before that debt doubled and then doubled again?"" we find that debt has doubled five times in four decades (blue triangles).

Then if we perform an exponential curve fit (blue line) and round up, we find a nearly perfect fit with a R2 of 0.99. This means that debt has been growing in a nearly perfect exponential fashion through the 1970’s, the 1980’s, the 1990’s and the 2000’s. In order for the 2010 decade to mirror, match, or in any way resemble the prior four decades, credit market debt will need to double again, from $52 trillion to $104 trillion.

Finally, note that the most serious departure between the idealized exponential curve fit and the data occurred beginning in 2008, and it has not yet even remotely begun to return to its former trajectory.

This explains everything.

It explains why Bernanke’s $2 trillion has not created a spectacular party in anything other than a few select areas (banking, corporate profits), which were positioned to directly benefit from the money. It explains why things don’t feel right, or the same, and why most people are still feeling quite queasy about the state of the economy. It explains why the massive disconnects between government pensions and promises, all developed and doled out during the prior four decades, cannot be met by current budget realities.

Our entire system of money, and by extension our sense of entitlement and expectations of future growth, were formed during and are utterly dependent on exponential credit growth. Of course, as you know, money is loaned into existence and is therefore really just the other side of the credit coin. This is why Bernanke can print a few trillion and not really accomplish all that much, because the main engine of growth expects, requires, and is otherwise dependent on credit doubling over the next decade.

To put this into perspective, a doubling will take us from $52 to $104 trillion, requiring close to $5 trillion in new credit creation each year of that decade. Nearly three years has passed without any appreciable increase in total credit market debt, which puts us roughly $15 trillion behind the curve.

What will happen when credit cannot grow exponentially? We already have our answers; it’s been the reality for the past three years. Debts cannot be serviced, the weaker and more highly leveraged participants get clobbered first (Lehman, Greece, Las Vegas housing, etc.), and the dominoes topple from the outside in towards the center. Money is dumped in, but traction is weak. What begins as a temporary program of providing liquidity becomes a permanent program of printing money needed in order for the system to merely function.

Debt and Europe

The debt situation in Europe is fairly typical of the developed world and mirrors the debt chart of the US seen above. There’s entirely too much debt, and most of the unserviceable amounts are concentrated in certain spots (i.e., PIIGS), while the amounts owed are concentrated in the German, French, and British banks.

This New York Times graphic did an excellent job of summing everything up.

Here is a slightly less-complicated image that expresses the same dynamic:

If everybody owes everybody else, then kicking the can down the road only works if there’s more wealth, more growth, and sufficient economic activity down that road to service the past debts. If any one participant drops the baton in the debt relay race, the absurdity of the situation becomes unavoidable and the cause is lost.

When we hold this view, it is abundantly clear that adding more debt along the way only increases the burdens and is therefore ultimately counterproductive, although it does grant the gift of additional time to avoid facing the truth.

When all of the most indebted countries are stacked up, we see that all but Russia carry a total indebtedness greater than 100% of GDP and that nine are carrying debt levels higher than any that have ever been repaid historically.

(Source) Note: 260% debt-to-GDP is the all time record for repayment, accomplished by England between 1815 and 1900, but required both massive cuts in spending and an industrial revolution.

Without mincing words, the world does not face a crisis of liquidity, nor a crisis of insufficient debt, but one of entirely too much debt. That’s the entire predicament in three words: too much debt.

More debt is only going to compound the predicament, yet that is what the world’s central banks and political structures are busy manufacturing. More debt.

Of course, debt is only one component of the story; there are also liabilities to consider. The above chart merely graphs the legally defined debts involved. If we bother to add back in the liability components, which are pensions, social security and government medical plans, the predicament is seen to be three to six times larger:

Whereas the prior chart showed all debts incurred by all sectors of each nation, the above chart only displays government debt and liabilities. For reference, the red bars, above, are the amounts that you read about in the paper when commentators note that the US, for example, still has a debt-to-GDP ratio that is under 100%. It’s a comforting tale, but not an accurate description of the situation.

Again, there are no historical examples of any country ever digging itself out from so deep a hole, and yet we find that the entire developed world has bravely pushed itself deep into unknown territory, seemingly without any serious discussions about whether or not this made sense.

Where We Are Now

So here we are, just a few weeks away from the end of the second round of quantitative easing (QE II) , with massive public debts and liabilities having only grown larger instead of shrinking during the Great Recession, everybody in nearly the same boat, and no clear plan for how all the sovereign debts will be funded from current productive cash flows (i.e., existing GDP).

This is why so many commentators, myself included, are convinced that more thin-air money printing is on the way. My thesis, laid out back in early March is that the Fed will stop QE II on schedule and that the financial markets will react exceptionally poorly to this loss of support. Commodities will tank first, then stocks, then bonds; from riskiest and most-leveraged to least.

It is time to face the music; the levels of indebtedness now require permanent support from thin-air money in order to avoid a deflationary collapse. Given this reality, we explore key questions in detail in Part II of this report: Understanding the Endgame:

How will the global debt crisis play out?

What does a world economy without growth look like?

What steps should we, as individuals, need to take in preparation?

Our monthly Monetary Watch, an Austrian take on where we are on

the monetary inflation front and whats next

Headline Monetary Aggregates in November

The U.S. money supply aggregates based on the Austrian definition

of the money supply, what Austrians call the True Money Supply or

TMS, were mixed in November, with our shorter-term one and three-month

rate of change metrics continuing their recent surge while our longer-term

twelve-month rate of change metrics showing some moderation. Focusing

on TMS2, THE CONTRARIAN

TAKEs preferred money supply measure, we find that it

increased at an annualized rate of 15.6% in November, bringing the

three-month rate of change to an annualized 15.2%. Thats up

from Octobers 14.5% rate and 13.3% rate, respectively. In

contrast, the twelve-month rate of change metric on TMS2, the measure

we watch most closely, went the other way, ending November at a

rate of 9.8%, down from Octobers 10.5% rate, and marking the

end, albeit barley, of 22 consecutive months of double digit increases.

As has been the case throughout 2010, M2, the mainstreams

favorite monetary aggregate, continues to show subdued growth, in

November posting a year over year rate of increase of 3.1%, down

from Octobers 3.2%. As readers of this site are aware, THE

CONTRARIAN TAKE posits M2 as a grossly misleading measure of the

money supply, meaning the gap between the true and the perceived

rate of monetary inflation is a healthy 6.7 percentage points.

A Return to Double Digit Increases in the Offing?

We must say that we were a bit surprised by that 9.8% twelve-month

rate of change print on TMS2. As we argued in last months

Monetary

Watch, we were expecting TMS2s 22-month string of double

digit rate of change increases to continue well into 2011. Yes,

it fell short by only 2 bps, but double digits it was not. We do

think though that a return to double digit rate of change increases

are in the cards, for three reasons

First, the recent surge in TMS2  up an annualized 10% the

past six months and 15.2% the past three  should be supportive

of higher twelve-month rate of change increases over the coming

months.

Second, the full impact of the Federal Reserves QE II asset

purchase program was not felt in the money supply aggregates. Coming

as it did mid-month, plus what appears to be a larger than projected

draw-down in the Federal Reserves Agency portfolio, QE II

yielded an annualized impact of just $$600 billion in November instead

of the projected $$900 billion.

Third, and most important, private banking institutions are not

only continuing to print money, but appear to be doing so at an

accelerating rate. In fact, Uncovered Money Substitutes, i.e., bank

deposit liabilities not covered by bank reserves, the issuance of

which is the result of the banking systems efforts to lever

up its loans and investments on top of what is currently a mountain

of excess reserves, is growing at a year over year rate of 19.9%,

a post credit crisis high.

to most folks is the U.S government's war against the small independent

dairy farm. The politically correct posture in mainstream nutrition

circles today is a war against saturated fat (found mostly in animal

foods). Brad Edmonds has pointed

this out on several occasions. The FDA, the USDA and numerous

state health departments would have conniptions over the articles

which have appeared on the LRC website from such libertarian gourmands

as Gary North, Brad Edmonds, Karen

DeCoster and Jeremy

Sapienza extolling the virtues of fatty animal foods and (gasp)

even raw animal foods.

Gary

North would merit particular censure because he dared claim that

such a dietary

regimen (which included raw milk and raw organ meats like brain)

saved his life. I think Brad Edmonds might get a few hacks as well

for suggesting that raw

or undercooked pork can be eaten safely. Holy bejeezus!

That must explain the crazy anarcho-capitalist stuff he writes.

An

exciting thing (for me) is that Gary North, Ph.D. was treated by

Francis

Pottenger, M.D., whose book, Pottenger's

Cats, makes a powerful argument for using raw animal foods

to prevent and heal disease. There is even a foundation devoted

to preserving and expanding his work, the Price-Pottenger

Nutrition Foundation.

The

Price-Pottenger Foundation and the Weston

A. Price Foundation are primarily dedicated to the work of Dr.

Weston A. Price. This Cleveland dentist was, in my opinion, the

greatest clinical nutritionist of the last century. If you want

a primer on real nutrition, his book, Nutrition

and Physical Degeneration, is the place to begin. Dr. Price

traveled the world studying societies who for generations had withstood

the onslaught of modern degenerative diseases like tooth decay,

diabetes, stroke, cancer and coronary heart disease.

His

is an ignored work today because the healthiest groups he observed

had diets full of butter, cream, milk, meat, seafood of all types,

organ meats, etc. Some of the groups, like the Eskimos and Masai,

hardly ate any starchy carbohydrates at all. The Eskimos had very

little carbohydrates of any type in their diet. The Masai, whose

diet consists mainly of milk, meat, and occasionally blood, had

and still have as a group one of the lowest cholesterol levels in

the world.

He

also noted that the distinguishing characteristic of all

these groups, regardless of the actual specifics of the diet (which

varied greatly depending on geography which affected the availability

of food), was the daily use of raw animal foods of some sort, without

exception. And in a further politically incorrect observation,

Dr. Price commented that the premier health food around the world

was…butter!

One author notes:

""…many

people around the globe…have valued butter for its life-sustaining

properties for millennia. When Dr. Weston Price studied native

diets in the 1930’s he found that butter was a staple in the diets

of many supremely healthy peoples.1 Isolated Swiss

villagers placed a bowl of butter on their church altars, set

a wick in it, and let it burn throughout the year as a sign of

divinity in the butter. Arab groups also put a high value on butter,

especially deep yellow-orange butter from livestock feeding on

green grass in the spring and fall. American folk wisdom recognized

that children raised on butter were robust and sturdy; but that

children given skim milk during their growing years were pale

and thin, with “pinched” faces.2

Butter is Better"" Health Freedom News, 1999

He

noted that whenever people from these groups adopted what he called

""the displacing foods of modern commerce"" they would invariably

suffer from modern degenerative diseases. Whenever they returned

to their native diets they would invariably recover from these diseases.

Perish the thought! Eating fat and meat to recover your health?

The low fat (and vegetarian) police simply don't know what to do

with his body of material.

For

a modern nutritional application of his principles, Nourishing

Traditions: The Cookbook that Challenges Politically Correct Nutrition

and the Diet Dictocrats, by Sally Fallon with Mary Enig,

is a good read even though it is a cookbook. The first seventy eight

pages are priceless and deserve to be in a stand-alone format.

For

a modern clinical application of the observations of Price and the

work of Pottenger, see We

Want To Live by Aajonus Vonderplanitz. For those of us who

are more academically inclined the book will be frustrating for

its lack of references, but the story is quite compelling. It details

the use of raw animal foods like meat, milk, butter and cream in

healing people of cancer, diabetes, and a host of other diseases.

Price,

Pottenger, and many others like them are ignored because we live

in a fat phobic and raw phobic society, despite solid evidence that

the high-carb low-fat approach is one of the roots of much of what

ails us today (as well as evidence suggesting that Pasteur was wrong

and the danger of bacteria and parasites in food is overstated,

especially given modern entrepreneurial inventions which do wonders

in protecting our food supply. Some

Doctors have even suggested that some diseases are a result of not

having enough parasites in our system).

While

high-fat high-protein diets are all the rage at the moment (Dr.

Atkins and Protein Power for example), rest assured the food Nazis

are working overtime to turn the tide against this populist monstrosity.

Even more, in many metropolitan areas around the country, it is

considered de rigueur to eat raw animal dishes like sushi, sashimi,

carpaccio and steak tartar. There are even restaurants out here

on the left coast that use raw in their name.

I

will never forget the delight my server had the first time I ordered

steak tartar from a popular upscale restaurant in my area. He is

from the old country and was simply delighted that a relatively

young chap like me knew ""what was good for him."" Little

did he know I was about to sprinkle my tartar with a wonderful homemade

sauce that consisted of raw butter, virgin coconut oil, and garlic,

which I had secreted into the restaurant. Tartar is my favorite

politically incorrect dish because it has raw beef and raw

egg.

This

brings me back to the original point of this article and the problem

at hand. While it is still possible to go into a store and buy raw

meat, fish, and eggs (and this may soon change because of the threat

of biological terrorism, at least according to my local paper),

has anyone noticed there is one product you cannot buy raw?

Hmmm…think

about it for a moment. It is the stuff which is supposed to do a

body good. It also helps build bones in twelve different ways. Various

celebrities sport moustaches on billboards around the country extolling

it virtues. There is even a major computer maker that uses the source

of this foodstuff as their logo and occasional ad spokesman. You

got it, milk, or more generally, dairy products of all stripes.

As

of this writing the only raw dairy product that you can find on

a somewhat regular basis at retail is cheese. Even then, by law,

it has to be cheese that is aged over 60 days (presumably to kill

any dangerous pathogens present in the milk) which severely limits

the choice to only hard cheeses.

Any

real cheese connoisseur knows that some of the best cheeses in the

world are imported or local raw milk cheeses and wouldn't think

of eating a pasteurized copy. There has been more than one occasion

upon returning from Canada that cuban cigars weren't the only contraband

I was carrying, a number of fresh soft cheeses that I can't get

in America somehow magically appearing in my luggage.

Ronald

Reagan signed into a law a statute forbidding the interstate sale

of raw milk products. So even in states where raw dairy is legal

the products can't cross state lines (except cheese aged at least

60 days) although people often cross to obtain these products. Most

states have for all intents and purposes regulated raw dairy out

of existence even where it is legal.

Despite

the proven virtues both medically and nutritionally of raw milk

(in contrast to the proven negatives of pasteurized homogenized

milk, which we only have today because of bureaucratic intervention)

there has been an unceasing war against it producers. Dr. William

Osler called it white blood. Hippocrates referred to it as a cure

for tuberculosis. Dr.

J.R. Crewe routinely healed people of various disorders using

raw milk in the early part of the last century. Dr. William Campbell

Douglass has in our time done the same thing. None of this is speculation

or private opinion but a matter of public record.

Yet

producers and sellers of raw milk, butter, and cream are regularly

persecuted around the country, saddled with enormous legal bills

and often robbed of their livelihood. Consumers like me often must

go through enormous pains to get the stuff and are very leery of

sharing sources lest the powers that be force them out of existence.

Several

months ago I received an email that highlights the plight of farmers

who want to meet the demand for raw dairy products:

Dear Friends,

I am writing

to request MIGHTY prayers from you on our behalf regarding a very

critical situation.

Last Thursday

2 State Dept. Ag people and 1 USDA person arrived at our farm

unannounced. Their sole intent appeared to be shutting down every

operation we have here. Below are some of the highlights:

1. Because

we sell PEOPLE food for pets, they say we are not in compliance

with labeling laws for pet food and they will require nutritional

analysis and additional labeling for EVERY package of pet food.

2. The SAME

agency who said we could sell raw dairy for animal consumption

now says that we cannot and furthermore THEY WILL BE LEVYING A

FINE.

3. The USDA,

whom we had met with regarding our on farm (legal) chicken processing,

now questions its legality and compliance.

4. They even

took a SOAP label to question its merits, and soap is regulated

by FDA, not USDA.

5. On this

Friday I found out they had also visited the place where we purchase

DRY ICE and inquired about our business with them.

This is very,

very serious and threatens our very livelihood as well as that

of other producers' grass-fed meats, pastured poultry or even

soap! If the state or Feds in TN are able to shut down ANY aspect

of our operation, it will set precedence for other government

agencies EVERYWHERE.

Before it

is over and done, I expect to also see EPA (feather and blood

composting) and OSHA at our door as well. Without Divine intervention

I expect this to escalate and get very, very unpleasant. (BTW,

yes we have attorneys on retainer.)

Please feel

free to cross post this email, but only in its entirety.

Now

the point of this article is not to convince you of the efficacy

of raw dairy products. Due to the influence of Pasteur (who was

a poor scientist and was

refuted by his colleagues in his own day) the idea of raw animal

foods of any sort may scare you to death. Rather it is to point

out the extremes to which Leviathan will go to control every aspect

of our lives. Mrs. Drake is apparently not aware of the precedents

that have already been established around the country regarding

the raw milk issue (if this is of interest to you I would suggest

locating a copy of The Milk Book by William Campbell Douglas,

M.D. It is a delightfully funny read on the trials, travails and

benefits of raw milk).

Forcing

people who voluntarily want to purchase raw dairy products to request

them under the guise they are buying them for their pets is a rather

silly intrusion of government into our lives. ""Hey Fido, move

over boy so I can lap up some of that milk you are having. If I

drink it on my own I will be guilty of a crime.""

Or

gathering a group of people to jointly buy a cow in order to partake

of raw dairy (since owners are not restricted by law from drinking

or eating their own product), while creative, is an equally silly

intrusion and often time consuming. It is called a cow share program

in some states. Some rather adventurous smokers have done the same

thing with a bar in California to get around the onerous smoking

laws in their state. Since all the patrons and workers are owners

they can't be prosecuted for violating the smoking ordinance because

it only applies to establishments that have employees.

Or

having to drive an hour and a half each way because there is only

one producer in the state who is bold enough to sell raw milk at

retail; by the time you add up the costs that is a very expensive

bottle of milk or pound of butter. I currently pay $$16 a pound for

my dairy contraband (my dog loves the stuff). Before the producers

in my area grew tired of being harassed by the state health department

and ceased operations, I could buy it direct from the farm for $$3

a pound.

The

USDA and the FDA have routinely forced alternative health practitioners,

medical doctors who use effective, harmless, non-invasive therapies,

even vitamin peddlers and producers of independent food stuff out

of the market.

Most

of us think of the FDA in terms of the middle letter of the acronym

— Drug. I say it is time we looked at them in terms of the first

letter of that acronym — Food. Their police powers are just as onerous

albeit less noticed in this area.

Yes,

the war on drugs must come to an end, but so should the war on food.

Both the food and drug wars attack and criminalize the behavior

of people who are often near and dear to us, and in the case of

small farmers, hard-working entrepreneurs as well. Moreover, the

idea that government can dictate what appears on our plate does

not square with a free society. To the FDA and the USDA, I say a

pox be on both their houses.

215079,"Ok, OK!! I’ll run. I can no longer withstand the pressure upon me by those who wish me to declare my candidacy for president. My fax machine is hot to the touch, the phone won’t stop ringing, and the phone company warns I may need a second line. My e-mail inbox is so stuffed that my ISP is complaining, and the mailman says the post office is considering hiring extra help to deliver the mail to my door. I give up! I’ll run!

Well, not run, exactly. Actually, I’ll stroll, at a leisurely pace. I’m far too old to run. And, although I suppose I should be flattered by the demands for my candidacy, I’ve read the Constitution’s description of the president’s job, and there isn’t so much to it. A high-school grad of my generation (literacy was a requirement for graduation then) could hold down the position. But the pay is good, the perks fabulous; and some retirement income would be appreciated.

A few carping critics may point out that I have stated my preference for anarchy, and thus must be a hypocrite to run for president. But the jump from enormous, fascist-type government to complete absence of government isn’t going to happen in one leap. I would try to bring it about gradually, so that non-anarchists might eventually realize that proper government plays so little role in their lives — and a negative one to boot — that it might well be abolished, while the anarchists discover that a truly Constitutional government is quite tolerable, even if not ideal.

Of course, I’ve got to have a platform. All candidates have them, and they are pretty much indistinguishable, one from the other, over the last few decades, at least. They promise benefits for some people, without acknowledging that they will be at the expense of all the other people. The promises are grandiose, and rarely if ever fulfilled, or even mentioned again after the election. My platform is different, because what I promise I will actually do, thus sparing the citizens the ephemeral dismay of learning, in summer, that what I had promised the previous fall wasn’t going to happen. So this is what I will do if elected, right up until the time of my assassination.

Foreign Policy: isolationism. The U.S. has involved itself in the affairs of virtually every other government on the face of the earth, and what has it gotten us? Well, the special interests by, and for whom, the government operates, have gotten a great deal from our foreign entanglements, but I won’t have their endorsement or support; and they can fend for themselves once I’m in that oval office. Specifically: foreign aid would end, instantly. I won’t hear any arguments that it must be continued pursuant to some law or another. Any law repugnant to the Constitution is no law at all, and binds no one, and never did. Goodbye, foreign aid. U.S. soldiers are in over a hundred countries around the world. Why? Beats me. They should be home, where they belong. The United Nations would be invited to leave the U.S., and our participation withdrawn.

Domestic Policy: the Constitution. A flawed document, no doubt, but giving it more than the lip service it now receives would revolutionize our society. Perhaps ninety percent of the present government would evaporate. In particular, I would re-introduce money into the American economy, replacing the credit which, unlawfully, displaced it a few decades back. Our mints would again provide coins of gold or silver, but without the word ""dollar"" appearing upon them, since the politicians can so easily change the meaning of that word to suit their (not your!) purposes. (This actually isn’t a very big change: the word ""dollar"" has no legal meaning now, so eliminating it will change nothing. The people, of course, can refer to the coins with any nickname they choose.) Rather, the coins would simply state the weight and purity of the precious metal of which they were made. Fractional reserve banking would, naturally, be unlawful, but this would be a matter for the states to enforce on local banks. Thus inflation would virtually cease to exist. Money plays such an important role in society, that without sound money, a sound society is impossible. Outer space? Well, if you want to form a private company to explore it, go to it! Food and drugs? Let those who consume them control them. Federal courts? Except for the Supreme Court, do away with them. War on drugs? I’ll admit defeat, and withdraw with as much grace and dignity as possible. Income taxes? The IRS would be required to reveal the very limited nature of the taxing power of the federal government, and the income tax on Americans would vanish, without changing a word in the law. Those in jail convicted of ""tax crimes"" would be released on the day after my inauguration.

Well, you get the idea. There’s a lot more, but I’ve got to reply to those faxes and e-mails, answer letters, and return those countless phone calls. Oh, and let’s save a few bucks and skip a convention, and all the legal paperwork. Just write me in!

Politics don’t often divert Hong Kong’s manic obsession with business and finance, but the upsurge of youthful discontent has presented China with one of its biggest popular challenges since the 1989 Tiananmen uprising – which China insists never happened.

So far, China’s Communist Party and its tough new boss, Xi Jinping, have stood back and taken no serious action to curb the peaceful demonstrations. Now, however, protest leaders are threatening to seize government buildings unless Beijing drops plans to select Hong Kong’s new government in 2017.

Considering that Beijing is ruthlessly crushing protests by Uighur Muslims in its strategic westernmost province of Xinjiang, Hong Kong’s demands for true autonomy and self-rule come at a particularly difficult time for the Communist Party which is feting its 65th anniversary of taking over China.

Western media, often hostile to China, is portraying the uprising as a struggle by democrats against party dictatorship. Reality is rather more complex. Hong Kong never had democracy under British Imperial rule: it was run by an autocratic British colonial governor – and run pretty well.

When China assumed control in 1997 of long-lost Hong Kong, it vowed to maintain its special self-governing status for 50 years, except for defense and foreign affairs. China appointed the former colony’s chief executive, but locals were given some latitude.

This “one state, two systems’ worked well. But a new generation wants democracy and real political power. Beijing is unlikely to ever War at the Top of the ... Eric Margolis Best Price: $$2.99 Buy New $$22.99 (as of 05:00 EST - Details) accept such a development. Hong Kong is isolated from the rest of China and self-contained, but Beijing fears the internet and social media will spread the virus of democracy – even chaos – to the rest of China.

China’s leadership has a deep-seated fear of uprisings. Though largely unknown to westerners, China endured a cataclysmic revolt from 1850 to the late 1860’s, the Taiping Rebellion. A nobody named Hong proclaimed himself the younger brother of Jesus Christ and launched a peasant rebellion against the doddering Manchu Qing dynasty that eventually cost over 20 million lives. Western forces led by Gen. Charles Gordon – henceforth known as “Chinese” Gordon – finally crushed the Taiping Heavenly Army.

Beijing’s deep fear of today’s eccentric Falun Gong religious movement reflects the lasting danger of another Taping-style uprising. Gordon went on to fight another religious-nationalist movement, the Dervishes of Sudan. He was killed in Khartoum.

The authorities in Beijing are also on the lookout for western machinations in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. A number of US-financed non-government organizations (NGO’s) operate in Hong Kong. Similar groups, notably the US National Endowment for Democracy, were involved in attempts to overthrow the governments of Georgia, Ukraine, Iran and Russia.

As a result, China’s security police are cracking down ever harder. Beijing also knows that among the so-called “terrorist camps” in Afghanistan when the US invaded in 2001 were CIA-run bases training Uighurs to fight in western China. The US public was never told about these camps. Most of the other supposed “terrorist camps” in Afghanistan were actually being used by Pakistani intelligence to train guerilla fighters for use in Indian-ruled Kashmir.

Meanwhile, Beijing is also warily watching US efforts, that began under the Bush administration, to draw India into a military alliance and further widen its huge market for arms.

Secret talks are underway between Washington and Delhi for India to take a more extensive economic and new military role in Afghanistan.

New US-supplied weapons systems have strengthened India’s military capabilities against main rival, China. At this moment, Indian and Chinese troops are in a confrontation in the high mountains of Ladakh, carefully watched by Pakistan, a close ally of China.

Indians are too smart and independent-minded to become mere native troops (sepoys) for Washington. But they will certainly use their new influence in the US to promote their power vis-à-vis China. Beijing is sharply aware of this development; it tends to overestimate the threat of the US-India strategic alliance. Chinese hardliners darkly suspect the US of planning to break up China, starting in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.

On a more prosaic level, Hong Kong and Shanghai have long been bitter rivals. Years ago, Hong Kong was the only gateway into Communist China. Today, most of China’s trade doors are open, considerably reducing Hong Kong’s commercial and financial importance. The Party has long favored more reliable Shanghai over too-westernized Hong Kong.

The slow decline of Hong Kong and rise of Shanghai and Shenzen are producing economic stress inside the former colony. Interestingly, many of Hong Kong’s original movers and shakers came originally from Shanghai.

China would be most unwise to send its army into Hong Kong at a time when it is trying to become the world’s epicenter of commerce and finance. So a backroom deal may be likely in which Beijing makes some concessions without losing much face. Otherwise, the tempest in the Hong Kong teapot could become a political tsunami for the rest of always restless China.

402172,"Let’s run a quick test. Say that you have been looking through reviews of recent Hollywood movies. You are reading along, trying to get a sense of what a movie is all about, when you see the word ""Palestinian."" The next word is:

A. businessman B. scientist C. student D. terrorist

You now read reviews of movies released after 1960. You read the word ""fundamentalist."" The word preceding it is:

A. lovable B. educated C. principled D. bigoted

Back in 1994, Michael Medved, the orthodox Jew who had attacked Hollywood in his book, Hollywood vs. America: Popular Culture and the War on Traditional Values (1992), followed up with a PBS documentary, Hollywood vs. Religion. Medved in those days reviewed movies for PBS. I never saw his documentary on PBS, but I own a copy of the videotape, now unfortunately out of print.

Medved makes an important point: openly anti-religious movies consistently lose money — lots of money. The classic example is ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (1988), whose presentation of a confused, self-doubting Jesus outraged Christians. It lost at least $$13 million. Medved says that producing these movies is ideologically motivated. They represent a statement of faith by the liberal community that dominates Hollywood. These people are rich, and they are willing to pour big money down predictable sinkholes ""for the good of the cause.""

He provides a revealing chronology. In 1959, the biggest Hollywood blockbuster was “Ben-Hur,” which won a record 11 Academy Awards. The next year brought the break in Hollywood’s tradition: “Inherit the Wind,” a movie version of a highly inaccurate 1955 play about the 1925 Scopes’ trial, although it presented the story as fiction. (Elsewhere, I have presented the story of that trial in its historical context, a still-continuing battle for control over the content of public school education: taxpayers vs. a self-certified academic cartel.) From that point on, says Medved, the industry’s self-imposed restrictions on anti-religious movies steadily broke down.

In 1961, the Motion Picture Academy awarded the Oscar for best actor to Burt Lancaster for ""Elmer Gantry,"" the movie version of Sinclair Lewis’s 1927 novel about a morally corrupt evangelist. It had taken over three decades to get that book onto the silver screen. The best thing I can say for the movie is that Lewis’s Gantry was worse. (Rent it. It does not hold up artistically. ""Ben-Hur"" does.)

Medved says that the old Hollywood’s Jewish moguls knew that their customers were Americans, and Americans are religious. The Jews who created the film industry, in author Neal Gabler’s phrase, as ""an empire of their own,"" were wise enough and profit-motivated enough not to launch a direct assault on the religious mores of the country. They wanted in on the American dream, not to undermine it.

The movies were favorable to American religious and moral values most of the time. Gangsters and adulteresses either died or repented before the movie was over. One exception, from “Gone With the Wind” to “Pretty Woman,” has been the familiar theme of “the prostitute with a heart of gold.” Belle Watling, the madam in “Gone With the Wind,” did not die in the end, nor did she repent, and she was pictured as “basically decent, except for that.” This culminated with “Pretty Woman,” where the lead character, a prostitute, marries the rich hero and gets social revenge on the Beverly Hills saleswomen who had scorned her. (I was rooting for the saleswomen.)

When ""Chariots of Fire"" won the 1981 Oscar for best picture, this blindsided Hollywood. The picture had been produced in England. It, too, holds up. (What does seem strange is that a Catholic actor played the Jew, Abrahams, and a homosexual actor played the Christian, Liddell. But the casting worked. The homosexual’s only other memorable role before he died of AIDS was in ""Gandhi,"" where he played a minister — a liberal, fortunately.)

Selective Demonization

On December 11, I watched a rented video, ""Escape from L.A."" (1996), starring Kurt Russell. The basic theme has long appealed to me: how to get out of Los Angeles and stay out. This movie was a sequel to ""Escape from New York"" (1981), which ignited the adult phase of the career of Disney child star Russell — one of the few child stars ever to make the transition. (His 1980 comedy, ""Used Cars,"" was a riot, at least for those of us who were tired of Jimmy Carter’s inflation, but it failed at the box office.)

This movie undermined the reputation of director John Carpenter. The word ""stinker"" doesn’t do it justice; it is not that good. The villain is a President-for-life, played as a cartoon caricature by the once-talented Cliff Robertson. The President had moved the nation’s capital to Lynchburg, Virginia. (Get it? The home town of You Know Who!) He is a tyrant, a liar, a coward, and a fundamentalist, who has imposed a terrible penalty for moral criminals: permanent exile to Los Angeles, which had been turned into an island by an earthquake. The year is 2013. Stacy Keatch — who long, long ago was America’s most promising young Shakespearian actor — turned in the only halfway decent performance as a ruthless military policeman.

The movie, whose script was co-written by Carpenter and Russell, was an attack on religion and moral values. It included a rarity, a Muslim who was not a villain. She was a slut, but a basically decent one. (""A slut with a heart of gold."") She had been exiled to Los Angeles because she had been a Muslim in South Dakota, and this had become illegal. You can sense the quality of the screenplay. (Casting Peter Fonda as an aging surfer was the movie’s one touch of realism.)

After it ended, I began to rewind it. The screen went blank briefly, and I found myself watching the NBC movie of the week, ""The Natalie Cole Story."" It was a pretty good movie. It followed her descent from a successful popular singer through drug addiction, divorce, bankruptcy, and recovery through spiritual renewal. It presented her as a serious Christian.

She narrated the film and starred in its closing scenes of her more mature years. I had not seen this technique before. It worked.

Natalie Cole is a mini-icon. Her father was a full-scale icon, and deservedly so. He was in every sense a gentleman. He was the first American black to cross over that most exclusive of color lines, the popular love ballad. The public passively accepted the idea that he could sing love songs to millions of white women. Almost nobody complained, and after the one attempted violent attack on him in the South, he dismissed it as not being representative of anything except one man’s hate. Nat King Cole had advantages, of course: a magnificent voice, great musical taste, and superb orchestral arrangements. The term ""beloved"" applied to him and Bing Crosby, but to no other pop singers that I can think of. There was no way to give Natalie Cole the Elmer Gantry treatment.

She made it clear that Jesus Christ is her God, that her faith had delivered her, and her lack of faith had led her into drugs and despair. She had almost destroyed herself, as she makes clear in her narrative. She ended the movie with these words: ""It is all grace, but I try not to waste it."" I cannot think of a closing line in any movie that made a more important theological point.

Was this movie a break from Hollywood vs. religion? Not at all. Two groups have only rarely, if ever, had their religions pictured as corrupt by Hollywood: Jews and blacks. There is no equivalent of Elmer Gantry in their celluloid ranks.

The lesson? Artistic self-policing works just fine when the groups on-screen are part of the liberals’ agenda for social reform.

It is clear who the main targets are today: conservative Christians and Middle Eastern Muslims. Mormons are left alone. So are Quakers, the Amish, and other pacifist groups. These groups are perceived as not having enough votes to give liberals political trouble, at least not outside of Utah. Liberals are willing to write off Utah.

To Inflict Pain

In 1988, when ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" was released, a few pastors in Tyler, Texas decided that this was too much. They organized a boycott. Fundamentalist pastors rarely organize local boycotts, but they had had enough. They asked their members to agree for one year not to attend any local theater that showed it. Then they approached the manager and told him that it would hurt his business to show it. He showed it anyway. A year later the theater was bankrupt. The building was refurbished and rented to retail stores.

Boycotts may not work at the national level, where movie producers have deep pockets, but most of America’s movie chains today are in bankruptcy, and the others are close behind. Red ink is flowing. Local year-long boycotts of all 12 or 16 screens can have positive effects. ""When you grab them by their tickets, their hearts and minds will follow.""

Back in the days of the Catholic Office for Motion Pictures and the Legion of Decency, Protestants had an ally that understood the importance of tight church discipline, and also how to use this discipline to make persuasive suggestions to outsiders. The Catholic hierarchy made it clear to Hollywood that it would cost producers big money if certain standards were violated on-screen. This led to some silly rules, such as twin beds for married couples, but the overall effect was positive. The Legion of Decency used the free market to pressure profit-seeking filmmakers to restrain themselves. But the Legion went out of existence in the late 1960’s, along with Catholic Church discipline. A new system of ratings was self-imposed by the industry. Standards began to decline immediately, and this includes artistic standards.

My suggestion: We could use a few more legions and a lot more decency.

218237,"The formula for a successful nation was spelled out a long time ago by Chinese sages. Nothing in the modern world renders it obsolete. It is one of those universal truths that remain true for all times and for all people.

""The men of old … first set up good government in their own states; wanting good government in their states, they first established order in their own families; wanting order in the home, they first disciplined themselves; desiring self-discipline, they rectified their own hearts; and wanting to rectify their hearts, they sought precise verbal definitions of their inarticulate thoughts,"" the sages said.

One of the traits that distinguish the modern liberal is the belief in systemic problems and therefore systemic solutions. The conservative recognizes that all human problems begin with the individual. The liberal, believing that crime is a result of societal conditions, thinks that if the society is corrected, crime will disappear. The conservative knows better.

While all humans must adapt to their environment, happiness is not dependent on the environment, but rather on the individual’s assessment of his environment. More importantly, the environment cannot change the individual. A wise Jewish doctor who survived the death camps discovered that Sigmund Freud — who believed that if the restraints of civilization were lifted, people would revert to animal savagery — was wrong. In the camps where those restraints were destroyed, he said those who came in good remained good; those who came in bad remained bad.

In other words, whether one is kind or ruthless is not a product of the environment. It is a product of what is in the individual’s heart. To use a more common example, all that alcohol does is lower inhibitions. Therefore, a ""mean drunk"" is a mean person even when sober. A ruthlessly selfish person is a ruthlessly selfish person even in ordinary circumstances.

That is why government’s ability to control individuals is quite limited. It can attempt to manipulate their minds, and it can apply sanctions to certain actions. But laws and penalties against murder cannot change a killer. If they could, there would be no homicides. Laws and penalties against fraud and theft cannot change a crook. Therefore, just as the Chinese sages realized, all reforms must not only start with the individual but be carried out by the individual.

While extreme circumstances, such as poverty that threatens the life of a man’s family, might cause an honest man to steal to keep his family alive, such a person remains an honest man, whereas the dishonest individual will steal even when he is rich. The corporate crooks we see today were already rich beyond the dreams of the average person, but they stole anyway. Avarice rules their hearts.

One of the advantages of religion is that virtually all the major religions recognize the reality of human nature, which is flawed and fallible. Therefore, they concentrate on helping the individual rectify his own heart rather than seek societal changes. George Washington recognized this. He pointed out that a free republic requires virtuous citizens. Religion is the only force that can teach virtue to masses of people. Therefore, anyone who is an enemy of religion is an enemy of a free republic.

Organized religion, of course, cannot escape human nature. Priests, preachers, rabbis and imams can be bad people, too. But on the whole, religion will reform more people than a million laws. It is well to remember that the greatest mass murderers in human history — Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot and Mao Tse-tung — were all atheists. They were men who carried secular modern liberalism to its logical extreme.

Imperfect humans will never create a perfect society or a perfect government. But we get closer if we aim correctly. Today, the major emphasis in our country should not be on immigration or the war on terrorism or global warming, but on the family. We should always judge each law and each policy on the criteria of what effect it will have on the family.

Im not going to go so far as to say that a societal upheaval will mean returning to a stone age existence, but when the systems that keep our everyday life humming along go down, fire will once again have a huge impact on our ability to survive.

This fact was brought home to my wife and me two winters ago, when a February blizzard knocked out the power to several counties. It was early evening  the lights flickered a few times, and then the house was plunged into darkness. Everything became eerily quiet, save for the wind howling outside and snow pelting against the window.

Then there was another sound  the reassuring popping of a log in our big airtight Franklin stove which continued to throw off its heat, oblivious to the fact that the juice was off. For the next thirty-six hours we used it to keep us warm, melt snow to flush toilets, and even did a some cooking over its coals. While other folks along our country road bundled up in sleeping bags and shivered until the outage ended, the disruption to our lives wasnt nearly as great as it could have been.

If you live in a northern climate, staying warm is important for nearly half of the year. Did I say important? Make that vital because without a way to keep the temperature in your home or bug-out place at a life-sustaining level, you will die of exposure! Your gas or oil furnace will be fine as long as your fuel supply lasts or the electricity doesnt fail. These are finite resources, however, and during a long-term disruption of goods and services, your pilot light will go out at some point (probably just when a January blizzard comes howling in).

The only logical solution is to turn to wood heat, or more precisely, a wood-burning airtight stove (fireplaces are fine for ambiance, but horribly inefficient for warming you since most of the heat goes up the chimney). The next question, then, is where will your wood come from, and what skills and tools do you need to convert it to usable fuel for your stove?

Log Logistics

The countryside is full of burnable litter. Next time youre out and about, take a look around. Fallen branches and even a downed tree or two are common sights in any woodlot or park, or along rural roads. Most of it, though, is too small to keep a fire going with the BTU output thats needed to warm your home. Real firewood consists of pieces of thick branches or trunks that have been cut and split to a size of about 16 long and roughly 5 or 6 in diameter. Anything smaller will require re-stoking the stove every few hours, while bigger pieces may smolder unless the fire is wastefully large.

At present, I get most of my firewood supply from a local landowner, who doesnt like downed trees lying around and sees it as a favor when I clean up the woods for him. After a big summer storm, city folks without saws will gladly offer you a tree thats toppled in their yard. Likewise, a downed tree across a rural road usually belongs to the first one whos there to cut it up. During bad times it would likely be possible to barter for timber with a landowner who doesnt have the tools or know-how to utilize it himself -probably working together and then sharing it. State or federally-owned hunting land and wildlife areas also have downed timber, which can often be claimed by anyone with the gumption to go get it.

If we ever arrive at a point where vehicles and trailers are no longer available, all of your wood will have to be hauled by hand. That means that laying in a good supply now, when you can still move it efficiently, would be a good idea. Having a sizable woodpile to begin with puts a buffer between you and calamity. Get your wood from the more distant locations while you can still truck it, and leave the easier pickings for when you may have to move it manually.

Wheel barrows are, in my opinion, a poor way to transport anything heavy for any distance due to their chronic balance problems. With their single, small, pneumatic tire, they are not made to move loads over uneven ground. Take one into the woods and roll over a few blackberry brambles, and the tire will inevitably puncture and go flat. A better alternative is one of those game haulers with large, hard rubber wheels. Theyre made for going over rough terrain easily, and can handle a maximum load with a minimum amount of effort (they can also haul around a lot of other heavy stuff that might need moving).

Burning Questions

Literally any wood will burn. One year we survived two months of a Wisconsin winter heating with willow  a wood near the bottom of the BTU list. Likewise, this past winter we used a fair amount of box elder  another low grade tree. Woods like this certainly will throw out enough heat to keep you warm, but they burn fast, requiring a larger supply.

The primo varieties include oak, hard maple, locust, hickory and apple. Next down the line but still good, are ash, birch, cherry, and hackberry. Unless there is nothing else available, however, avoid any of the evergreen species, since their resin content tends to start chimney fires, spit sparks, and can flash back when you open the stove door.

Firewood should season for at least six months after being cut green (a year is better) although a few varieties, like ash and locust, will burn without much drying.

How much is enough?

Weve just been through a mild winter here. Spring has arrived and, after checking the wood shed, I see that weve gone through about six cords of mixed hardwood (a stove cord is a stack four feet high, eight feet long, and 16 deep). A bad winter, like last years, would probably have required another cord.

A household could get by on a lot less, though. For one thing, we have a large stove and heat the entire place with it. The fire is usually lit in November and doesnt go out until late March. A smaller stove heating a smaller area would take far less fuel. And if our wood supply had been limited, instead of basking in 70 degree temperatures all winter, we could have stretched the supply by burning less  in an extreme case, just enough to keep the place at 50 degrees. This would have been uncomfortable, but it would have enabled us to survive.

Cutting Remarks

If you envision doing your cutting with a chain saw after society falls apart, picture those last precious (and irreplaceable) drops of gas disappearing into its tank. Even if youve stocked a large supply of fuel and bar oil, gas has a shelf life, and how many chains do you have? The other problem with a chain saw (besides the fact that, being a machine, it will need unobtainable replacement parts at some point) is that it makes noise. This broadcasts a message to anyone within a mile that someones cutting a pile of firewood that could be pilfered from the producer as soon as hes finished the work.

Long-term survival requires stepping back into the 19th century and taking up the hand saw. Do you have one capable of cutting through a 30 inch tree trunk? Probably not, but realizing the need for producing burnable chunks suitable for splitting that will hold a fire all night should inspire you to get one.

A crosscut saw capable of handling tree trunk needs to be either a one or two-man model 48-56 long. If youve got a partner, go with a two-man type. Ive got one that can be set up either way, with add-on handle on one end that converts it from a solo saw to a duo.

370525,"On numerous occasions, I have received e-mail from readers who express surprise at finding a lawyer who argues the case for liberty. And not the phony “you are free to be regulated” unfree kind of liberty, but genuine, “do as you see fit with your own free will and be responsible for the consequences” liberty. Given that a prominent hippie with a law degree publicly debated the meaning of the verb “is,” the correspondence I have received is not surprising.

Although it is true that many lawyers, particularly the prominent glamour hounds who appear on television (and who are portrayed in the largely execrable lawyer shows on television), are card-carrying Leftists, this is not because they are lawyers. These Lefty lawyers were almost certainly Lefties before they ever came near a law school.

Consider: why does one go to law school?

In many cases, law students have no idea what to do with their life. In other cases, one goes to law school to follow in a family tradition of the practice of law. In yet other cases, law students are seeking a law degree because they are starry-eyed visionaries (social reformers, you see). The law can be a powerful tool for shaping society.

To generalize, however, it is dangerous to generalize about lawyers. The real enemy, of whom Americans should be watchful, are the empty-headed children who:

graduate from terrible grade schools, barely able to read, write, or add; graduate from terrible high schools, still barely able to read, write, or add, but now more arrogant, horny, and susceptible to sophistry; and graduate from fluff factories known as “colleges” and “universities” (the term “multiversity” is now more appropriate) with little more in their heads than: the desire to have tremendous amounts of sex; and either the desire to “make the world a better place,” or make lots of money;

and in the end, are 25-year old children with “Juris Doctorates” and the Mandarin-like ability to navigate through the corridors of power to get what they want (however short-sighted, selfish, or base their desires might be).

They almost certainly graduate from college with little or no understanding of foreign languages, let alone foreign cultures, and little or no understanding of history (American or otherwise), literature (American or otherwise), philosophy, religion, etc., etc., etc. ad infinitum. Not to mention little or no understanding of the nature of the law, i.e., of the philosophy of the law. As there is no such thing as right or wrong, of course, there is no such thing as the nature of law, and so this does not disturb them in the least (nor does it disturb most of their professors, but I digress).

The entire educational establishment in the United States verges on an exercise in high-priced social promotion. In fact, now that “education” has become almost completely detached from any actual learning, becoming “educated” is now very much like obtaining a driver’s license or a permit: pay a massive fee, fill out some forms, smile a bit, and, as if by magic, you are “educated.” You are educated because you have a piece of paper (a diploma) which says that you are educated. Here is your Doctorate in Education. Now go and run a school district on the thousands of dollars per household that you coerce every year.

Unfortunately, many people blinded by (b) and (c) above choose to go into the practice of law. And it shows. Notice that Bill Clinton, a lawyer, had his head filled with (a) through (c), inclusive. Americans have almost no respect for the legal profession, largely because of the fact that individual lawyers have behaved so badly.

Those who behave badly do not only include those whose greed spurs them on to bombastic lawsuits, but those who seek to remake the entire world according to the images which they have built up in their 25-year old minds.

Think of it: a law school graduate who goes straight from undergraduate college to law school is 25 years old when he graduates. What does he know? He knows he likes beer, he likes sex, he wants life to be free and easy, and he sees no reason why anything like religion or tradition has any place in life. By and large, such things have no place in his personal life (again, see Bill Clinton, the poster boy for the notion that “personal” life is irrelevant to public life. “Yes, I cheat on my wife and break my wedding vows, but you 260 million people that have never met me can trust me not to break my promise to uphold the Constitution.” Right. Personal life is wholly irrelevant).

Consider two archetypes: the dullard and the zealot.

First, the dullard. His caring, compassionate, Left-wing, Democrat-voting grade school, high school, and college teachers convinced him that the world should be however he wants it to be. His own weak moral character, and his susceptibility to temptation, helped him along the way. He gets what he wants, and all is good. There is no such thing as right or wrong, other than the idea that he can do as he pleases, and he can force others to do as he pleases they should do. Bill Clinton is this type. Note, however, that such a man of mediocrity (in all things but lying) rose to be the President of the United States. Note also that he received a larger advance for his upcoming “memoirs” than did Pope John Paul II.

Second, the zealot. Her caring, compassionate, Left-wing, etc., etc. have convinced her that she has a manifest destiny to fulfill, much as did Chairman Mao and Lenin. The ridiculous windbag Hillary Clinton is this type. And we see where eight years of fabulous lies, regarding: (1) cattle futures trading, (2) the White House Travel Office, (3) the Whitewater land deals, (4) confidential FBI files of Republicans, and (5) Vince Foster, have landed her: not in jail, but in the United States Senate. Don’t forget the $$8 million advance she received for her upcoming memoirs.

Query: how can two people who profess to have no memories of numerous events publish memoirs? Sounds like an exercise in fiction (much like their public life: phony photo ops and nothing more).

I ask you, gentle reader, are there better role models for aspiring, young, libidinous liars and money-grubbers? One is hard-pressed to imagine them.

There is much to despise about the Clintons, and about other attorneys as well. The fact that they are lawyers should not be one of these things. Whether one is a lawyer or a doctor, or a member of Congress, one can be a sniveling lackey of statist planning, or one can work for freedom from government.

If anything, the distaste for lawyers comes down to a distaste for what it is that lawyers are able to do to people, namely, land them in all sorts of practical difficulties from which one cannot be extracted, in many cases, without spending large sums of money. Lawyers can harass and annoy with the best of them (“ethical rules” to the contrary notwithstanding). That is something to dislike.

But it is not their law degrees that make the Clintons, or any other lawyers, repugnant. It is their ideas and their actions. It is how they use their legal education.

Why point this out? If the United States is ever again to be a “nation ruled by laws, and not men,” there must be more lawyers who will work toward that goal not merely because a client will pay them to do so, but because the work matters. Like it or not (and most, I think, do not), the practice of law has taken on such importance in American society that it cannot be abandoned to the hordes of collectivism.

In closing, tell your favorite lawyer jokes as often as you like. Remember, however, that it isn’t the law degree that makes the sleazy lawyer a sleaze, it is his own bad moral character.

374194,"An Orwellian America

As a young man, I voraciously read George Orwell’s 1984, Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World and Alvin Toffler’s trilogy which included Future Shock, The Third Wave, and Power Shift. During the era of the Vietnam War, I wondered seriously about the future and how it was destined to unfold. Now being considerably older, I have the vantage point to reflect back on my early ruminations and expectations. Unfortunately, I am too old to alter the lessons that are now so painfully obvious. Instead, I pass the gauntlet to those who can understand and take action on what I have unavoidably come to expect for America.

A FRAMEWORK OF UNDERSTANDING

THE ‘HUXLEY-ORWELL’ TRANSITION

I recently read a perceptive paper by Chris Hedges that would have made any English Professor envious, powerfully philosophical but not something an Economics department would pay much attention to. I found it both intriguing and enlightening.

I have borrowed so heavily from it, that I am unsure where the lines diverge. Therefore, below I give full credit to Chris Hedges and take full credit for all the bad ideas.

Chris Hedges of TruthDig.com wrote 2011: A Brave New Dystopia, from which the following evolved.

The two greatest visions of a future dystopia were George Orwell’s 1984 and Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. The debate, between those who watched our descent towards corporate totalitarianism, was who was right. Would we be, as Orwell wrote, dominated by a repressive surveillance and security state that used crude and violent forms of control? Or would we be, as Huxley envisioned, entranced by entertainment and spectacle, captivated by technology and seduced by profligate consumption to embrace our own oppression? It turns out Orwell and Huxley were both right. Huxley saw the first stage of our enslavement. Orwell saw the second.

We have been gradually disempowered by a corporate state that, as Huxley foresaw, seduced and manipulated us through:

• Sensual gratification,

• Cheap mass-produced goods,

• Boundless credit,

• Political theater and

• Amusement.

While we were entertained,

• The regulations that once kept predatory corporate power in check were dismantled,

• The laws that once protected us were rewritten and

• We were impoverished.

Now that:

• Credit is drying up,

• Good jobs for the working class are gone forever and

• Mass-produced goods are unaffordable,

…. we find ourselves transported from Brave New World to 1984.

The state, crippled by massive deficits, endless war and corporate malfeasance, is clearly sliding toward unavoidable bankruptcy.

It is time for Big Brother to take over from Huxley’s feelies, the orgy-porgy and the centrifugal bumble-puppy.

We are transitioning from a society where we are skillfully manipulated by lies and illusions to one where we are overtly controlled.

Huxley, we are discovering, was merely the prelude to Orwell.

Now that the corporate coup is over, we stand naked and defenseless. We are beginning to understand, as Karl Marx knew:

Unfettered and unregulated capitalism is a brutal and revolutionary force that exploits human beings and the natural world until exhaustion or collapse.

UNSOUND MONEY LEADS TO STATISM

With this as a backdrop let’s explore how Unsound Money in concert with the Huxley-Orwell Transition leads to Statism, the path which I believe we are presently on.

THE CATALYSTS BEHIND THE “TRANSITION”

1- UNSOUND MONEY

• Removal from Gold Standard and adoption of Fiat Currency regime (in August 1971 during the winding down of the Vietnam War; the first War ever fought without tax increases to pay for it; the beginning of endless ‘conflicts’ and the War on “Terror”).

• Creation and Fostering of a $$67 Trillion Shadow Banking Credit Growth,

• Massive Securitization & Off Balance Sheet Contingent Liability Debt Growth.

2- POLICY FAILURES

• Failed Monetary Policy & Monetary Malpractice,

• Moral Malady,

• Failed Fiscal Policy,

• Failed Public Policy,

• Growth of Political Polarization,

• Entrenched ‘Left-Right’ Factions,

• An Un-Governable Democracy.

3- CRISIS OF TRUST

• Lost Respect & Confidence

• A Doomed Middle Class

• A Broken Social Contract

4- AUTHORITARIAN ACCEPTANCE

• Central Planning

• Growth in Regulations & Control

• Crony Capitalism & Corporatocracy

• Big Government

• The Huxley – Orwell Transition

CRUMBLING BARRIERS

• The Great Huxley-Orwell Transition

• From Manipulative to Repressive

ROADBLOCKS

• Financial Security through Sound Money REMOVED

• Reduced Personal Freedoms through a Crisis PENDING

• Reduced Personal Security through a Constitutional Crisis FUTURE

DRIVERS

• Globalization & Complexity

o Fragile versus Robust Systems

o Interconnectivity and Counter Party Dependency

• The Productivity Paradox

o Creative Destruction & Job Creation

Let’s shift gears and consider what “greases the skids” in enabling this transition in our society to occur.

COLLECTIVISM

In The Road to Serfdom, F.A. Hayek showed how governments, supported by a collectivist mindset, always tend towards totalitarianism. Even the most libertarian government thus far created, the government of the United States, has slipped incrementally towards totalitarianism over the past two centuries. This is because it is an inherent trait of a government.

The degree of socialism in the United States increased substantially after the establishment of the Federal Reserve System (1913) and the measures taken during the Great Depression (1929-46) which it created. Ever since the early 1900’s the United States has had a two-party system dominated by ‘socialists’. The Republican Party has always advocated conservative socialism. The Democratic Party, which in the 19th century favored libertarianism, advocates social-democratic socialism. So long as people are divided by Left and Right, Democratic and Republican, the US is prone to being influenced by factions who transcend party politics and from behind the scenes could possible exert strong control over the United States. They could do this by maintaining power over public opinion and hence over the course of government. Steadily, the United States has been travelling down the road to totalitarianism, and many people have not noticed, possibly because they are only looking at the position on the Left-Right paradigm.

Upon further analysis, it is clear that Left, Right and Centre, are all forms of socialism. In particular, we may call them “social-democratic socialism” (the Left) and “conservative socialism” (the Right). They are both socialism because they both share the principle that the government should “run” and “mold” society, by using legal force and intervention to transfer property and personal wealth as part of the political scientists’ process of ‘redistribution of wealth’.

The differences are only in the particular ways the government should run society – the methods it should use, and who, exactly, should be the recipients of government wealth transfers and who should pay. In particular:

• Social democrats tend to prefer heavy taxation, large wealth transfers to the poor, and nationalized industries, and oppose price controls, regulations and behavioral controls.

• Conservatives tend to prefer lower taxation, a smaller welfare state, regulated (cartelized) industries, price controls, product and behavioral controls.

Nolan Charts: Personal Freedom versus Economic Freedom

The modern Republican Party is Center-Right on the Left-Right paradigm. As with the Democratic Party, this obscures the huge range of views Republicans hold on how powerful and how much control the State should be allowed. Their 2008 presidential nominee John McCain, like Barack Obama, strongly favored socialism, though with a Right-wing flavor. Barack Obama (blue circle) and John McCain (red circle) are positioned in the accompanying graphic. Thus, the two main candidates at the 2008 Presidential election represented a false choice – really no choice at all. One candidate, Ron Paul (yellow circle), stood in stark contrast to the candidates, favored by the mainstream media and political establishment. As would be expected, he was neutralized by the mainstream media outlets as a zealot with an unsound political view of America.

THE POLITICAL CONTINUUM

THE EMERGING ROADMAP TO STATISM

Let me now develop and explore the roadmap that outlines the path leading from Policy Failures and Monetary Malpractice, stemming from Unsound Money, to STATISM.

First we will build the outline for the basis of a roadmap on a number of observable continuums.

The more complex that issues become, the more collectivism will dominate and individual needs will be repressed. In turn governments will be forced to be more repressive to maintain control over increasing polarization and diverse views and opinions.

EVOLVING STAGES

When we arrange our various continuums we arrive at the representative grid model shown below.

We will quickly acknowledge it is not ideal, but it allows many concepts currently at play to be shown in relationship to others.

This grid is best described as the social forces at play within Globalization – Financial, Economic and Political.

DRIVER$$ – VISIBLE & INVISIBLE

There are both visible and less visible forces at play that are forcing ‘greasing’ the skids in the movement towards Statism.

The roadmap integrates well into our roadmap from our THESIS 2011: Beggar-Thy-Neighbor / Currency Wars and 2012 Thesis: Financial Repression papers.

ORWELL’S 1984 IS HAPPENING

We are one crisis away from a police state. All the powers are in place. Someone will flip the switch. Whether a Cyber Attack, escalating Currency War tensions or a ‘terrorist’ attack by indebted college youth, it is only a matter of time and circumstance.

Recently by Jack D. Douglas: The Secret Government

Karzai’s public denunciation yesterday of the U.S. collusion with Taliban forces in Taliban attacks on his government forces in Afghanistan to lead the U.S. forces to stay in Afghanistan longer may be true or false, but they miss the point of U.S. military strategists who want to stay in Afghanistan with massive bases and forces. They are not simply playing an imperial game of milking the resources of puppet nations. That is probably true for U.S. Oligopoly Corps., but the U.S. is playing a vastly more deadly game than that.

I have argued for years that a crucial reason the U.S. wants major air bases and massive forces in Afghanistan is that the U.S. is very afraid of what will happen in Pakistan, especially the massive nuclear forces and missiles. The Pakistani government is very likely to fall soon. The society is in worse shape than the U.S. economically and financially and politically and legally, so it may implode at at any time or erupt in civil war[s]. It does have a dominant cultural-ethnic nation and religion, unlike the U.S. which is very splintered now. But it has massive subcultures and simmering civil wars on the borders of Afghanistan and inland. The U.S. has relied on its secret satellite spying and forces within Pakistan to keep tabs on where the nuclear weapons are so a sudden strike can take them out or even land forces and seize them. But Pakistan is hiding them more and more and, like North Korea, with whom they cooperate, they are apparently rapidly building up small nuclear forces that can be moved around and hidden better. The U.S. cannot rely on carrier air strikes because they could be knocked out and, if not, cannot provide sufficient land forces against a major power like Pakistan, if they become needed. India will not likely cooperate for many reasons with the U.S. on this, such as Pakistan’s nuclear weapons that could easily target their vast cities. China is a major ally of Pakistan. That leaves major U.S. bases and forces in Afghanistan looking necessary to the imperial central planners in Washington.

N.B. Nothing is simple in Afghanistan. The major guerrilla forces, some paid by the U.S., some Taliban, some anti-Taliban, and Karzai, and the three major nations within Afghanistan have their own strategies. Karzai is trying to become more ""cooperative"" with the winning Taliban and other guerrilla armies, in case the U.S. does leave.

But any strategist not blinded by hubris would worry most of all in that area about Pakistan’s disintegration and nuclear weapons.

On the other hand, the U.S. has been the major cause of the disintegration of Pakistan and the building of more and better hidden nuclear forces. The longer the U.S. stays on its borders and keeps slaughtering women and children inside Pakistan with Obama’s Drone Slaughters, the worse the U S. makes the Pakistani threats, thus the more the U.S. wants to stay, thus ..

It’s a lose-lose situation, something U.S. central planners of the world can almost never see because they are blinded by ignorance and hubris.

It seems most likely the U.S. is maneuvering to leave vast bases and mobile force capabilities in Afghanistan. The U.S. has done this in Iraq in a major but not huge way because it has massive forces in the Persian Gulf region, bases it can use all around Iraq if necessary, and puppet allies like Saudi Arabia. The heavily armed U.S. division sized forces and secret Special Ops in Iraq can call on those massive forces in the region within hours. Not so in S. Central Asia where the Pakistani crisis is soaring.

The U.S. strikes against Pakistan or invasion when Pakistan implodes or is taken over by a more openly anti-U.S. army dictatorship could trigger the first nuclear war. Or they might simply lead to another huge land war in Asia for the U .S. that will help to bleed the U.S. to death immensely faster than Vietnam, Iraq, Afghansitan, etc. and trigger its own financial-economic-political-cultural implosion. The U.S. was loved by most Pakistanis before it invaded Afghanistan and slaughtered women and children in Pakistan. Now even Western polls there show almost total loathing of the U.S., which is obvious without any poll.

WHAT!?

I had been telling my daughter Mollie all week we would go to this show.

Mollie was very excited.

“Don’t worry,” Nathan had told me earlier in the day, “you will be on the list.” I am extremely grateful he did this for me.

I acted confused. I kept saying, “are you sure?”

I find when you act confused but polite then people want to help. There was a line behind me. I wasn’t fighting or angry. So there was no reason for anyone to get angry at me.

They just wanted to end the confusion.

The woman wrote down an “S” on two pieces of paper, smiled and said, “Shhh”, and handed them to us.

We were in.

BUT.

The “S” meant “Standing Room Only”

WHAT!?

I found a woman inside who could help me.

I said, “I write for the Wall Street Journal and I thought we would get great seats.”

“Ok,” she said, and she went off to find the president of the fashion company to get my front row seats PRONTO! This was all just a big mistake.

She came back. “You know….” she said, “we’ve already seated someone from the Wall Street Journal.”

You know that awkward silence that happens every time an asteroid comes within 47,000 miles of hitting the Earth and then nothing happens?

“Yeah, there’s a lot of good standing room only positions. Have a fun show!”

So Mollie and I took our standing positions behind four rows of seats that were next to the runway. She couldn’t really see.

We made friends with everyone standing around us. The ushers. The other people who were standing room only. I took pictures of Mollie with everyone.

Then when the lights started to dim, the ushers waved to Mollie. There was an extra seat near the front.

After the show we went to “SPIN”, the ping pong club.

“Oh, I’m sorry,” said the woman behind the counter, “all the tables are booked for the next two hours!”

WHAT!?

Apparently Bank of America was having a party and rented the entire place.

It’s not enough that they crashed the entire economy in 2008. Now they had to prevent me from playing ping pong on my daughter’s special night out.

“Don’t worry about it,” said Mollie, “we don’t have to play ping pong.”

I saw a table labeled “Bank of America” that was empty and it had two racquets left on it.

So Mollie and I played ping pong for the next hour. Nobody noticed.

Then the woman came up to us and said, “I have to ask you to leave. This table has already been paid for. You can’t play there!”

I offered to both leave and pay for the time we used. I did not want to cheat them in any way at all.

But she smiled and said, “Oh, you don’t have to pay. I just can’t let you stay there.”

So we left.

By the end of the evening:

we had gotten into an exclusive fashion event we had no tickets for and were not on the list for.

we got great seats even though we were “standing room only”

we played an hour of ping pong at the best club in NY for free, courtesy of Bank of America.

It seems small, but we broke all the rules and had a fun time. The key is that we were simply nice to everyone and didn’t argue and were very thankful at everything we got to do.

Don’t break the laws. Don’t kill people. Don’t steal. But most other rules can be bent.

If you act like the river, you ultimately flow past all the rocks along the way.

735698,"As we near to the end of the days of the dollar as reserve currency for the world, feeding our families becomes much more important. Most gardens go in over a late spring weekend with little thought given to trying to keep a family fed during the winter. My focus is on growing food year round with an emphasis on nutritional content. There are ways to keep tomatoes growing later in the season, or trying to keep greens growing year round. What can we grow that can be stored without electricity or canning. What can we save seed from in order to become more self reliant. Gardening can save you a lot of money while improving your health. Talk about a win-win situation! We use small raised bed garden areas for winter gardening 4′ wide with almost a foot of elevation. We live in Oregon and the winters constant rains can flood everything drowning your dinner. I use ½ PVC sections cut 10′ long and hooked onto short rebar sections beat into the dirt and covered with clear plastic to keep off the produce rotting rains and help keep it a few degrees warmer inside the hoop house. The ground stays a bit warmer anyway so low to the ground hoops work well. I also save gallon jugs filled with water to use to hold the plastic down and act as a heat sink to help keep things from freezing. So fold the plastic in and put the jugs inside the hoop. Spinach, lettuces, cabbage, carrots etc will all take some light freezes. This gives you some fresh foods coming in all winter long.

For winter focus on spinach, mustards, dandelions and other nutritious greens. Many started mid-summer can be kept growing slowly under a cloche in the winter. Low levels of light drastically limit plant growth rates. So pre planning and spacing become vital. I start planting for winter harvest in July. when the heat is on, few of us think about starting seeds. July is a good time to start carrots, cabbage, broccoli, lettuce and potatoes for overwintering. I also like to start Walla Walla onions and garlic in September. If you have never had fresh, home grown garlic you are in for a treat. It is up there with home grown tomatoes and corn for taste improvement over the store bought veggies. It is important to keep the winter garden seeds moist while germinating, which can be a little tricky when it is hot. I bought a new timer from Bi-mart that has a 6- hour setting. It worked quite well keeping my seeds moist. This works on batteries so put away several or set up a battery charger you can crank by pedaling a bicycle, or get a small solar charger. I try to automate as much as I can. You will want to get most vegetables planted by the beginning of August, depending on the maturity dates of the varieties you select. Varieties that have around a 60 day expected maturity can go in as late as mid-August. I like to try to plant spinach and lettuces every two weeks almost year round.

Potatoes and carrots can be kept out in the garden and harvested as needed all winter long. I grow a lot of garlic and onions to store in a cool dry area, One of the best things to grow are winter squashes. Acorn squashes are high in vitamins and minerals and are easy to store for the winter, there are many winter squashes our grandparents used to grow to have food for the winter. Sweet meat, pink banana delicata the list goes on. All are nutritious, easy to grow, easy to store and easy to save seeds from. Cabbages can be grown for winter use and kept in the garden under a plastic cover for quite some time and get sweeter with frosts. Or they can be piled in a card board box in a cool garage or basement. When one starts to go bad you can slice it up for sauerkraut or kimchi fermented food have additional health benefits.

Certified Organic Spin... Check Amazon for Pricing.

I have a shelves in my garage and pantry about 18 apart. I get card board boxes and use an X-acto knife to cut holes for ventilation and fill them with onions, squashes, apples, beets, pears and other food that stores in a cool dry place. Carrots, potatoes and other root crops can be stored in damp sand in a plastic barrel or tub if you need the space open for your winter garden. The winter garden needs more space than a summer garden because sunshine is at a premium. Space is also needed in order to allow ventilation to avoid mildews. A spray of baking soda and water can be used to treat mold and mildew. I use a table spoon of baking soda in a quart spray bottle. My secret weapon for amazing plant growth is manure tea I use a cheap aquarium pump with air stones in a barrel with a bit of manure (I use horse manure, since we have loads of it,) and water. Using this I would have orchids bloom for months on end. Things got too hectic to continue with my normal garden activities and I started using a store bought fertilizer and my orchids quit blooming.

The planning is most important and often not done. How much of what do you need to feed a family for a year? How much space will it take to grow it? How much space will be needed to store it? What conditions are needed for the best storage cool/dry? Cool moist? Say for instance you want to have cabbage every week so you need to grow 52 cabbages. Do you need to plant them all at once? A long season cabbage? Or do you grow a 60 day variety? Do you plant out 6 every month and then plant enough to get you through the winter July 15? Will you cover them with a plastic hoop house and store them in the garden or put them in card board boxes and create a type of root cellar storage area? How many winter squashes and of what kind? I plant acorn squashes in the middle of a section of field fencing formed into a circle, the vines climb the wire and keep the squash off the ground and save a lot of space. If you want to have squash every week you will need to grow 52 of them! Maybe 10 acorn and 10 pink banana 10 sweet meat 10 pumpkins 10 Butter nuts and 10 sweet potato squash. I grow most of my squashes even pumpkins on fence rounds I grow cucumbers on them and tomatoes in them. The holes are big enough I can get my hands in for picking, they hold the fruit up off the ground and save space. I will get 10 acorns off 2 fence sections depending on the growth style if the plant is a vining type I can grow three plants in one fence section. You must stake them down I use regular T posts beat into the ground.

737638,"""Shut up,"" Jack screamed at the crows, waving his arms wildly. ""Shut up, shut up!""

Only he really didn't utter a sound. And he didn't dare flail about either. But gawd, he hated crows. And he hated hearing their grating ""caww, caw"" sound twice a week from the vacant lot next to the commissary.

One really didn't dare cause a disturbance in line, Jack knew. He felt uncomfortable even talking to people, much less screaming at crows. You really can't risk being labeled a ""disrupter,"" especially with a family and kids. Ever since the ""commissary incidents"" two years ago there were T.O.'s — Tranquility Officers — everywhere. Even if you couldn't see them, you knew they were watching. So Jack bottled it up and just closed his eyes tightly for a second. When he opened them he shot a look of hate across the lot where the crows were perched in the bare tree above the frozen patches of ice in the empty lot. Maybe he could come back on the weekend. Maybe it would be sunny. Jack sure hoped so. And maybe the crows wouldn't be there reminding him of the endless gray winter. But then again, maybe they would. Besides, he thought, he'd already been waiting 45 minutes and he was almost at the corner and from there it would only be another half-hour. Jack pulled his coat a little tighter and kept quiet.

Besides the thought would occasionally occur to Jack while waiting in life's endless succession of lines, that maybe it wasn't really the crows he hated with all his might. Maybe they were just a convenient focal point, caught in the crossfire of desolation and deprivation. Maybe it was really the ""groat,"" the government rolled oat bread he hated. No, there was no maybe about that part. Cold, tough, stale and flavorless, two loaves twice a week. Jack knew he hated groat. From time to time he wondered why they couldn't have real bread made out of flour like people used to eat in when he was a kid.

But that's why there was a Food Czar, Jack knew, to figure that stuff out. He remembered watching the first Food Czar almost twelve years ago explain that sending wheat to rich Asian countries was only for the duration of the crisis, and that it was the patriotic thing to do during these times. Well, Jack thought, he was as patriotic as the next guy, even if he did join in the general discontent a few years ago when it seemed like things just kept getting worse. But he wasn't a ""disrupter"" or anything like that, although he had a few nervous nights wondering if he had complained too loudly to anybody. But that was before the new Food Czar. The new Czar had been a general in the ongoing war and he looked like the kind of guy who could really get stuff done. After all, it hadn't taken him any time at all to come up with the Recovery and Economy in Agriculture Plan, REAP, that set aside an additional 20 million acres for oat production. And he'd promised that REAP would really shorten the lines. Jack sure hoped so.

Besides, there was a presidential election coming up and the all the candidates were saying that if the Food Czar didn't produce results next year heads would roll and they'd get somebody in there that could really take charge. Jack sure hoped so. He was going to start paying more attention to the campaign.

By now Jack had reached the corner. He dug his hand into his pocket and felt for his plastic ration card.

""Gawd almighty,"" Jack thought. ""I hate crows.""

John checked his text messages as he got close to his neighborhood. There was one from his wife. ""PICK UP BREAD."" Seemed like there was always something, he thought.

In the store, John grabbed a cart just in case and headed for the bakery department. He knew she was going to be tied up this afternoon, but why couldn't she just leave a voice message like most people, he thought with a hint of impatience. Always text messages. Wouldn't it have been just as easy to leave a voice message? At least then she could have mentioned what kind of bread, or what it was for. Was it that awful white bread the kids like for sandwiches he wondered, or that tasty sprouted whole wheat that he liked himself? No, it couldn't be that since nobody else in the family would eat it. As he strolled through the bakery section he caught a whiff of the fresh sourdough coming straight out of the oven. Irresistible! Jack knew he couldn't be trusted shopping on his way home at suppertime, that he was the perfect impulse buyer. But he grabbed a loaf anyway.

It was at that moment he spied the long skinny loaves of French bread and remembered  French bread! Of course. She was making that shrimp pasta they'd seen on the Food Channel last week. It sure had looked wonderful on TV, and she was going to try it out tonight! And they'd served it with French bread so Jack grabbed a loaf, rolled through the wine aisle, picked a couple of bottles of a favorite, and headed to the check-out.

While he waited for his turn in the express lane, John noted the lady two shoppers ahead must have had at least 20 items. Didn't she see the sign that said 15 items or less, he wondered? He wanted to get home a try a slice of the sourdough while it was still hot enough to melt butter. In the meantime John busied himself reading the tabloid headlines on the rack in front of him. There was that one really good looking actress he liked, caught up in some weird love triangle. Another featured psychic predictions and a headline about a woman who gave birth to an eight-pound Chihuahua. That would be good. Another had something about a presidential race. Some people will read anything, John laughed to himself. Especially the old people. They still followed that stuff out of habit. Ever since the ""Leave Us Alone"" movement, those campaigns have been about as important as choosing the head librarian.

No sooner had he finished the thought than it was his turn. Took em long enough, John thought, feeling the sourdough loaf to assure himself it was still nice and warm. He chuckled to himself about the Chihuahua mother story as the cashier finished scanning his purchases, and handed her his gold card. She swiped it and gave him the receipt. ""Thank you for shopping with us,"" she said with a smile.

John nodded his thanks, grabbed the groceries with one hand and the receipt with the other and headed to the door.

He glanced at the total. They deducted .4672 grams of gold from his account. Not bad, he thought to himself, wondering if it was just his imagination or if the same amount of groceries wouldn't have cost him closer to three-quarters of a gram not too many years ago.

Smelling this fresh sourdough is going to make me famished by the time I get home, John thought, moving a little quicker.

When that April, with its fickle weather, Reflects March madness altogether, And pounds the District with such fury The politicians curse and scurry. When newsmen chase them seeking answers About leaks from CIA necromancers, The press secretary concocts such theories That the head does spin, and the eyes grow bleary. And young bloggers compose Internet discourses They research all night with help from secret sources.

So crazy does become the Capital City, Then congressmen gather in committee. And pundits skewer the president's invasion Of foreign lands that had not harmed this nation. And specially from every TV station Of the USA to Condoleezza they hasten The National Security Adviser for to grill That she had lied up on Capital Hill.

It so happened in that season on a day, In the fevered District at Bullfeathers I lay, Tossing down another gin and tonic Before attending more testimony moronic. But then there came into that famed saloon, A noisy, cursing Neocon platoon. So heated they were from congressional hearings They paid me no mind as they started sneering.

A General was there with glistening medals, Awarded for the wars he'd helped to settle Sad Vietnam did his war doctrine form; He'd chaired the Joint Chiefs during Desert Storm. And lately he had well served his nation With a deft Power Point presentation. Though the UN did reject his grave proposal, He was well regarded in the Office Oval.

There was a Wolfowitz at the door, And at the Rumsfeld his eyes did bore. ""We've no time for this Congressional hysteria. Our troops should be marching tonight on Syria."" The Rumsfeld shrugged, ""Yes, it's all overblown. Congressional scrutiny's a known unknown. But should a new crisis come, thanks to Bin Laden Congressional hearings will soon be forgotten.""

A Cheney popped in from an undisclosed location And nearly smiled at his standing ovation. He checked his own pulse with each shot of liquor Though the others would laugh, his scowl did not flicker. He spoke with a manner that showed he was certain Of the contracts he'd win for his beloved Halliburton.

With him was his student, a prideful young Flyer, Once a 12-stepper and lusty party goer. He'd helped fight the Cong in Vietnam From a forward position in Alabam. He wore a smart flight suit that shined like the sun He swaggered and grinned when he said, ""Bring 'em on."" His teacher, the Cheney, would act deferential To his eager young student despite low potential.

When into the bar there arrived an old Clarke, With the mind of a scholar and the bite of a shark. He'd worked for his country for one score and ten, And he walked among Neocons like Daniel in the den. ""You are liars and slackers in your sham war on terror."" And the cowards all shivered, ashamed at their error. Drinks spilled and men shrieked, and started a-runnin'. And I thought, but will they cease their neo-connin'?

743732,"Odds bodkins, zounds and strike me pinke. Chinese premier Wen Jiabao has just been to Stratford-upon-Avon and paid this little old country of ours the most terrific compliment.

Our economic growth may be only a tenth of Chinese growth rates; our tax rates may now  absurdly  be higher. We may have spent the past three years scratching our heads about how to replace the third runway at Heathrow while the Chinese have built literally 45 airports over the same period. The Chinese may be set fair to be the economic and political powerhouse of the 21st century, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they again mop up more gold medals than anyone else at the Olympic Games; and yet Mr Wen has been to watch Hamlet and declared that we can still claim to be the birthplace of ""the greatest writer who ever lived"".

Isn’t that grand? It is, of course, a huge tribute to Mr Wen that he can follow Hamlet as Shakespeare wrote it, picking it all up off the bat in a way that most GCSE English students would struggle to imitate. It is worth asking how many UK politicians could go to China and say anything remotely convincing about, say, Ming poetry. The only one I can think of is the great George Walden, father of this page’s Celia, and until George is recalled to the front bench I am afraid Parliament will always look pathetically ignorant.

Among my resolutions is to follow the younger generation and learn Mandarin. But if Mr Wen gets full marks for cultural diplomacy, the real tribute is, of course, to William Shakespeare. Never mind that he died almost 400 years ago. He is our greatest cultural export. He is our answer to Beethoven and Michelangelo, and a pretty effective retort he is, too.

He went global while he was still alive, carried overseas by Elizabethan merchant adventurers. The play Mr Wen has just watched was first performed in Indonesia, would you believe it, in 1609. In the decade after he died Shakespeare was performed in Germany, in German, by a group of travelling players. He has been big in China for at least 120 years, being known first as Shashibiya and then just as Sha Weng  ""Old Man Sha"".

His popularity survived the revolution to the point where it is acceptable for a communist leader to hail Shakespeare, not as a bourgeois reactionary, not as an imperialist capitalist running dog, but as the greatest writer who ever lived. When you stop to think about Shakespeare’s prevailing ideology, it is easy to see why.

As President-Elect Barack Obama vacationed in Hawaii on December 26, stopping off to watch a dolphin show with his family at Sea Life Park, an Israeli air raid besieged the impoverished Gaza Strip, killing at least 285 people and injuring over 800 more.

It was the single deadliest attack on Gaza in over 20 years and Obama’s initial reaction on what could be his first real test as president was ""no comment."" Meanwhile, Israel has readied itself for a land invasion, amassing tanks along the border and calling up 6,500 reserve troops.

On Sunday’s Face the Nation, Obama’s Senior Adviser David Axelrod explained to guest host Chip Reid how an Obama administration would handle the situation, even if it turns for the worst.

""Well, certainly, the president-elect recognizes the special relationship between the United States and Israel. It’s an important bond, an important relationship. He’s going to honor it … And obviously, this situation has become even more complicated in the last couple of days and weeks. As Hamas began its shelling, Israel responded. But it’s something that he’s committed to.""

Reiterating the rationale that Israel’s bombing of Gaza was an act of retaliation and not of aggression, Axelrod, on behalf of the Obama administration, continued to spread the same misinformation as President Bush: that Hamas was the first to break the ceasefire agreement, which ended over a week ago, and Israel was simply responding judiciously.

Aside from the fact that Israel’s response was anything but judicious, the idea that it was Hamas who broke the six-month truce is a complete fabrication.

On the night of the U.S. election, Israel fired missiles on Gaza that were aimed at closing down a tunnel operation they believed Hamas was building in order to kidnap Israeli soldiers. The carnage left in the wake of Israel’s bombing of Gaza over the past six weeks has killed dozens of Palestinians.

""The escalation towards war could, and should, have been avoided. It was the State of Israel which broke the truce, in the ‘ticking tunnel’ raid … two months ago,"" the Israeli peace group Gush Shalom wrote in a press release. ""Since then, the army went on stoking the fires of escalation with calculated raids and killings, whenever the shooting of missiles on Israel decreased.""

Over the last seven years only 17 Israeli citizens have been killed by Palestinian rocket fire, which makes it extremely difficult for Israeli politicians, which are in the midst of an election, to argue that their response has been proportionate or defensible in any way.

The asymmetry of the conflict leaves an opening for harsh criticism from the soon-to-be president Barack Obama. He has every right to oppose Israel’s belligerence. The international community and the majority of public opinion are on his side. Certainly he knows Israel’s disproportionate response has inflicted insurmountable pain on Palestinians as well as what the blockade has done by keeping vital medical and other supplies from reaching Gaza, where hundreds have died as a result of inadequate medical treatment.

While bombs fall on a suffocating Palestinian population and Israeli forces prepare for a ground invasion, Obama is monitoring the situation from afar after a talk with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other Bush administration officials. This isn’t leadership; it’s a continuation of a policy that has left Palestinians with little recourse, let alone hope for lasting peace.

""The president-elect was in Sderot last July, in southern Israel, a town that’s taken the brunt of the Hamas attacks,"" David Axelrod told Chip Reid on Face the Nation. ""And he said then that, when bombs are raining down on your citizens, there is an urge to respond and act and try and put an end to that. So, you know, that’s what he said then, and I think that’s what he believes.""

If Axelrod is correct, and Barack Obama does indeed support the bloodshed inflicted upon innocent Palestinians by the Israeli military, there should be no celebrating during Inauguration Day 2009, only mass protest of a Middle East foreign policy that must change in order to begin a legitimate peace process in the region.

375363,"The best ways of looking after yourself differ drastically through the decades. Here a GP, a dietician and a personal trainer give you all the guidance you need… whatever your age.

20s

Serious illness is relatively rare in this decade so it should be spent laying the foundations for excellent lifelong health, diet and exercise habits. It is also important to be aware of key diseases that specifically affect young adults.

GP Dr Ellie Cannon says: There are some diseases that are more prevalent in this age group than any other, so personal health awareness is key.

As you become sexually active, the risk of developing cervical cancer increases, so a smear test every three years from the age of 25 is essential.

Testicular cancer is a young man’s disease and most prevalent in those aged 20 to 40. Men should check themselves monthly for lumps.

Also, don’t get sunburned  sun over-exposure early in life is one of the biggest risk factors in developing malignant melanoma, the most aggressive kind of skin cancer, later on. Take photos of any moles to keep a record if they are changing over time.

DIETICIAN Catherine Collins says: The body absorbs older bone and generates new bone material to keep our skeleton strong. However, bone density reaches its peak in this decade, after which tissue is not replaced as fast as it is broken down. So diet in your 20s is key in optimising lifetime bone health.

Maximise Vitamin D (essential for calcium absorption) levels while the sun shines, with no more than a few minutes of skin exposure to the midday rays.

Top up with a daily 25mcg Vitamin D but avoid combination supplements containing Vitamin A at 1,500mcg or more  this prevents calcium cementing to bone. Choose calcium-rich, low-fat foods such as skimmed or fortified soya milk, low-fat yogurts and tofu to seal a healthy future for your bones.

PERSONAL TRAINER Gillian Reeves says: Do between three and five moderate cardiovascular sessions of at least 30 minutes each week, and up to three sessions of strength-based exercise using weights or body weight against gravity to work the muscles.

In your 20s your joints can cope quite easily with just about anything you throw at them. Jogging is ideal  the heel impact of this activity aids formation of new healthy bone in the leg.

30s

This is the decade when you should start planning your future health, and knowing your family history is important. It is a good time to speak to your parents about conditions that may have affected relatives.

THE GP says: If there is a family history of serious illness, speak to your GP about NHS screening available to those at high risk  for example, genes for bowel cancer and risk of osteoporosis can be detected in this decade.

Quit smoking now. Studies have shown that if you give up in your early 30s, by the time you are in your 50s your risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease will be the same as a non-smoker.

As you start your own family, priorities change  so men and women need to keep an eye on weight, which is implicated in health problems later in life.

It is much easier to lose weight now rather than trying later in life when health problems may have started, and metabolism has slowed down.

THE DIETICIAN says: Studies suggest that the amount of energy our bodies burn while resting is dropping at the age of 30, and it drops by a further seven per cent with every subsequent decade  so if you carry on eating like you did in your 20s, you may start putting on weight.

Watch out for snacking  make one snack fruit, and another a small handful of nuts or low-fat yogurt as their protein can blunt the appetite.

If you are a woman planning a pregnancy, take a folic acid supplement from now until three months pregnant to reduce the risk of the baby having spina bifida.

THE PERSONAL TRAINER says: Group exercise such as spinning or circuit training will give you the benefits of cardiovascular training and strength work.

In the 30s, aerobic capacity can drop by six per cent if you don’t do anything  so keep attending the classes. Plan time in your diary to attend a class to make sure you make the time for exercise.

The class environment will also give you the chance to socialise without having to stay up all evening in the pub  as some of you used to in your 20s.

40s

Concentrate on your heart health and reducing long-term risk of having a heart attack or a stroke. If you are overweight and have a poor diet, you will start to see high cholesterol readings and high blood pressure. Those with a family history may develop full-blown heart disease, experiencing symptoms such as angina.

But by changing your lifestyle now, you can turn things around and stave off problems in decades to come.

THE GP says: Don’t become complacent about weight, nonchalantly blaming extra pounds on middle-age spread.You should be more strict about having a healthy BMI and low waist measurement than you were in your 20s, as this is the decade they start to cause illness.

Ask your GP for a fasting cholesterol test, and find out what your blood pressure is. If the results are of concern, early treatment can dramatically reduce cardiovascular risks. Women need to continue using contraception until a year after the menopause, which usually happens towards the end of this decade, as you will still be fertile. Appropriate choices might be the mini-pill or a coil, as these don’t raise oestrogen levels, which can increase risk of blood clots.

THE DIETICIAN says: Try to have two alcohol-free days weekly, and drink less than 21 units a week for men and 14 for women. The occasional small glass of wine may decrease heart-disease risk, but more is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and liver disease.

Menopause and its hormone changes lead to increased body weight, especially an expanding waistline. Keep your BMI below 27. Downsize your portions and reduce carbohydrates such as rice, potato and pasta by a third.

THE PERSONAL TRAINER says: If you have spent the past decade slumped over a desk, pilates  an exercise system based on strength and flexibility that uses body weight as resistance  will help realign posture. In this decade, lean muscle mass decreases and body fat increases.

Women gain weight around the torso, back of arms and back. As well as feeling better, studies suggest that the risk of breast cancer reduces by up to 47 per cent and osteoporosis by 45 per cent if you continue to exercise.

224059,"With all the worry and pressure in today’s world, with the financial news going so bad, talk of taxes being raised, and more, who isn’t feeling huge stress and trepidation in their daily lives? How could this stress and pressure not be affecting our businesses as well as our personal well-being and family lives? This sort of stress cannot be good for our mental health.

It is the unusual person, indeed, who can shake off the troubles down at the company or office and leave that luggage outside the front door when they come home to their loving family.

Could you inadvertently be taking this stress out on your children? Have you found yourself getting a bit short-tempered recently? Have you gotten angry with your wife and kids and shouted or raised your hand only to later regret that you couldn’t control yourself better? Have you considered that this bad temperament at home could be due the inability to control stress from work? And that this stress is affecting you 24/7 whether you want to admit it or not?

Today’s short article will be about a simple and quick way that I guarantee will help you to control your stress and temper at home and become a better parent. All you need to do is spend 2 minutes a morning, every morning, writing down some quick notes in a notebook. And, no, 2 minutes is not a lot of time compared to what happens when you lose your cool and make a scene.

I used to have a bad temper, and I would get mad and shout, sometimes even raised my hand to my children… But since starting this method, that I will recommend today, it has been well over 2 years since that last happened. I haven’t even raised my voice once…. Every time that I did get irritated, something in my subconscious kicked in and I immediately calmed down. This worked for me and several other friends that I have recommended it to. It will work for you. Let me take a moment now to highly recommend a book that has actually led to all of this. This book helped me greatly at work (and now at home) since the first time I read it and that is Brian Tracy’s Goals!

In Goals! Tracy talks about how, if you are to succeed in life that you need to write down your goals in order to be able to achieve them. “Sure!” A lot of people say they’ve heard this or know this, but few actually do this. Trust that writing down your goals down does help your subconscious to actually remember and activate your brain to achieve those goals you set forth for yourself.

I write down my goals every day religiously in the morning when I wake up and, not only does doing so help me to achieve them, it also helps me to relax and stay much more focused through the day. Who doesn’t want to stay more focused in this day and age when our “in-box” includes, for most people, several e-mail accounts that are constantly filling up as the day goes by and consistently altering our priorities? Add on an Internet world filled with Social Media like Facebook and Linkedin accounts to attend? Twitter is no longer for just sending messages to your friends, but it too, has been co-opted into the business world and your boss orders you to use them, or blogs and SNS, to get the company message out…

How in the world can anyone today get ahead of the pile in the “in-box”? Any person in their right mind would be stressed.

Goals! promises that you will “Get everything you want, faster than you ever dreamed.” Sounds like grandiose claims but let me point out that writing down your goals and purposes is like having a sort of road map to where you want to go. When you write them down, they enter your subconsciousness and they cause your inner brain to focus upon the Law of Attraction. If you do not write down where you want to go — if you do not have a map — then how will you know where you are going?

The publishers write:

Why do some people achieve all their goals while others simply dream of having a better life? Bestselling author Brian Tracy shows that the path from frustration to fulfillment has already been discovered. Hundreds of thousands — even millions — of men and women have started with nothing and achieved great success.

Here Tracy presents the essential principles you need to know to make your dreams come true. Tracy presents a simple, powerful, and effective system for setting and achieving goals — a method that has been used by more than one million people to achieve extraordinary things. In this revised and expanded second edition he has added three new chapters addressing areas in which goals can be most rewarding but also the toughest to set and keep: finances, family, and health.

Using the twenty-one strategies Tracy outlines, you’ll be able to accomplish any goals you set for yourself — no matter how big. You’ll discover how to determine your own strengths, what you truly value in life, and what you really want to accomplish in the years ahead. Tracy shows how to build your self-esteem and self-confidence, approach every problem or obstacle effectively, overcome difficulties, respond to challenges, and continue forward toward your goals, no matter what happens. Most importantly, you’ll learn a system for achievement that you will use for the rest of your life.

One of my goals is to become a multi-millionaire. Laughable? Maybe. But at least I have a road map and I am consciously working on that every day… And since I do have a road map, it alleviates a huge amount of stress and worry from my shoulders.

I may not be a millionaire yet, but I really do have proof that this works! I have evidence that Tracy’s philosophy and ideas in Goals! are successful. I have shown myself that actually writing down goals are critical to achieving them. And my proof stands in something that, for me, is much more important than the Rat Race and making money: it’s being the best, most wonderful dad I can be.

It used to be my #1 priority in life was to always make more money. I always thought about how to increase my cash flow and I constantly worried about the economy. What a fool I was. My children were growing up around me and all I could think of was money. Then, one day, a few years ago my son said something foolish and I got a sudden flash of extreme anger. Later on, while my son was sobbing, I quietly considered and reflected upon my actions, I regretted them; I wondered if I had overreacted. I wondered if stress was clouding my thinking.

After deep consideration of that incident, I realized that the most important thing for me was not money. By far the most important thing for me was to be a great dad to my son. How could I have thought differently?

Now my #1 priority goal that I write down in my pocket notebook every day is; “I am a kind, loving and patient father and husband today and every day” (with today’s date added). Then, I write my next 9 goals, which have to do with making more money and being successful at work.

Folks, trust me. This really works! Since starting this habit, I have caught myself several times with a flash of irritation — that before would have caused me to get angry or upset at my son and perhaps raise my voice — but since I started writing down every day my goal of being patient and kind, my mind recalls that goal within a split second and has killed that flash of anger instantly its tracks. It is truly amazing.

Why ruin what could be a good learning opportunity with your children and a possible great memory with an outburst of irritability? What for? Life is too short to be getting upset at the small stuff all the time.

As the great writer C.S. Lewis wrote in Chronicles of Narnia, “Life is difficult, so let us be good to each other.”

Writing down my goals every day has truly helped my family to have joy, love and peace. Your family can have it too. All you need to do is write down your goals every day. You’ll be glad you did.

Don’t you and your family deserve it?

222057,"I, an American, have been living in the Paris region for almost ten years. In the age of the internet, keeping up with events and reading in English is not difficult. But finding books is a bit more complicated.

Don’t misunderstand, I can and have read a few books in French. The most challenging was Celine’s Voyage au bout de la nuit, that I chose to read because he had lived in my suburb Meudon, southwest of Paris. Perhaps the most interesting book I read in French is Le Vengeur, by Hungarian born Imré Kovacs. Kovacs died after being a long time waiter at the Brasserie Lipp, a famous restaurant in the quarter Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris. His journalist son found the secret manuscript after he died and had it published. Kovacs described an extraordinary 20th century adventure. During WWII when Hungary was overrun by the Germans he was recruited by the Jewish underground (he was Jewish but didn’t look Jewish) to join a Hungarian regiment of the Nazi Waffen SS as a spy! He was taken prisoner by the Red Army and finished the war in a Soviet prison camp. The next adventure after Le Vengeur (French Edi... Best Price: $$4.00 Buy New $$34.77 (as of 03:55 EST - Details) the end of the war and his release was to fight with his co-religionists in Palestine during the birth of the Israeli state in 1948. He was then persuaded to join the French Foreign Legion to hunt for and secretly execute ex-Nazis who had concealed themselves as mercenaries (Le Vengeur is The Avenger in French). As a legionnaire he participated in the 1954 Battle of Dien Bien Phu that ended French colonialism in Vietnam. He fought in a similar guerilla war for the French in Algeria before finally retiring to his prosaic life at the brasserie.

There are English language bookstores in Paris. Shakespeare and Company across the Seine from Notre Dame is the most well known. It has even made an appearance in the films Before Sunset and Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris. But I find that The San Francisco Book Company near Odeon has a better selection of used old books and much better prices. A book I recently purchased there was Daniel Deronda, the last novel written by George Eliot (the pen name for Mary Ann Evans). This is a somewhat strange Victorian novel (written in the 1880’s) that had gone under my radar such that I purchased it with no pre-knowledge even though the BBC had made a series of it. Deronda is raised as an English gentleman in an aristocratic home but he has never been told, and does not ask, about his parentage. This psychological vulnerability somehow (the plot is a bit fantastic on this point) leads him to an interest in the Jewish faith and Zionist ideas. When he finally learns that he actually is Jewish Eliot gives us this passage (from Chapter 63).

This new state of decision wrought on Deronda with force which surprised even himself. There was a release of all the energy which had long been spent self-checking and suppression because of doubtful conditions; Before Sunset Buy New $$2.99 (as of 06:15 EST - Details) and he was ready to laugh at his own impetuosity when, as he neared England on his way from Mainz, he felt the remaining distance more and more of an obstruction. It was as if he had found an added soul in finding his ancestry—his judgment no longer wandering in the mazes of impartial sympathy, but choosing with the noble partiality which is man’s best strength, the closer fellowship that makes sympathy practical—exchanging that bird’s-eye reasonableness which soars to avoid preference and loses all sense of quality, for the generous reasonableness of drawing shoulder to shoulder with men of like inheritance.

In a world of political correctness it was a pleasure to read this defense of prejudice, and Jewish prejudice no less, which states what is surely true that the more similar race, ethnicity and religion “the closer fellowship that makes sympathy practical.” There is another part of the novel that intertwines with life of Deronda about a beautiful girl in a bad marriage that is more classic and more entertaining.

The easiest way to buy English books is through Amazon.UK; for example, I have written about previous purchases of the Flashman series of novels. More recently I ordered the English language version of The Ancien Régime and the Revolution by Alexis De Tocqueville (the Ancien Regime was the ruling order of the nation state by the King with the support of the aristocracy). Tocqueville is famous in the US for his description of the country and its Midnight in Paris Buy New $$9.99 (as of 05:10 EST - Details) people in the 1830s, Democracy in America, which is still insightful today. The short book considered here was to be part of a bigger study of his native country France but he died (1859) before completing it. Nevertheless, in it you will find keys to understanding the origins of the French administrative state of today and the society it tries to rule. In particular, that the revolution did not change the nature of the French state, but only its ultimate head. The key changes that had morphed the decentralized medieval government into a top down Paris dominated society occurred in the 15th century when Charles VII levied a tax on the peasants without consent of the Estates General. This increase in central state power follows Robert Higgs notion of the ratchet effect in that it occurred during the Hundred Years’ War with England. Tocqueville quotes Commynes who said: “Charles VII, who won the argument over imposing the taille [the tax on peasants]when he wished, without agreement of the three Estates, laid a heavy burden on his own soul and upon that of his successors, inflicting a wound upon his kingdom which will bleed for a long time.” For Tocqueville this was so important that he believed “from that day was sown the seed to practically all the vices and abuses which plagued the Ancien Régime for the rest of its days and finally brought about its violent death.” Note the relative freedom the medieval system alluded to by Tocqueville is in accord with arguments of, for example, The Bionic Mosquito, that this era might be the best example of libertarian society. Finally, Tocqueville emphasizes in his description of the system that follows the Ancien Regime after the French Revolution that it retains the centralized authority made up of the middle class, the bourgeoisie. We can well appreciate his description of this new class that persists to this day in France and especially in Washington.

The government officials, almost all from the middle classes, already constituted a social class with its own peculiar spirit, traditions, virtues, code of honour and pride. This was the aristocracy of the new social order which was already established and active. It simply waited for the Revolution to open up a place for it. What already typified French administration was the violent hatred it felt against all those nobles and middle-class citizens who wished to run their own affairs beyond the reach of the government….

Perhaps understanding this history better through great books from other times and other nations will allow Americans to better understand their own predicament today?

465957,"No Democrat, liberal, or socialist could possibly defend Franklin Delano Roosevelt more passionately than does conservative Michelle Malkin in her new book, In Defense of Internment: The Case for u2018Racial Profiling’ in World War II and the War on Terror (Washington, DC: Regnery), 2004.

After decades of scholarship questioning Roosevelt’s New Deal programs and wartime tactics, it is refreshing finally to see an unwavering defense of one of FDR’s most universally discredited policies: the forced evacuation, relocation, and internment of 112,000 innocent Japanese American civilians, citizen and non-citizen alike. FDR is the quintessential hero of modern Democrats, but his camps, according to Malkin, warrant bipartisan applause. In four hundred pages of text, government documents, and photos of happily interned Japanese Americans, Malkin gives us plenty to consider.

So Much More Than Just Japanese Internment

Malkin explains that the term ""Japanese Internment"" is loaded, because there are technically different correct names for all the distinct policies Roosevelt had for relocating and detaining people without trial. Not all ethnic Japanese who were ""relocated"" were technically ""interned."" In a series of charts in Appendix F, Malkin lists the many ""relocation centers,"" ""citizen isolation camps,"" ""internment hotels,"" and other places at which FDR detained people without charging them of crimes. Malkin insists repeatedly that lumping all of the detainment policies and centers in the ""internment"" category is not only technically inaccurate, but, in some way or another, it aids the enemy.

In fact, Roosevelt — always inclusive and progressive — not only interned and detained those with Japanese heritage; he had the multicultural good sense also to intern Germans, Italians, Hungarians, Romanians, and Bulgarians. More than one might gather from the conventional wisdom, FDR practiced Equal Opportunity Internment.

Malkin shows that the Japanese were not the only ones who had to sacrifice for the Good of the Fatherland:

""Enemy aliens from all Axis nations—not just Japan—were subjected to curfews, registration, censorship, and exclusion from sensitive areas… And beginning in September 1940, more than a year before Pearl Harbor, more than 10 million young men of all backgrounds were conscripted into our nation’s armed forces. Approximately two-thirds of the 292,000 Americans killed and 671,000 wounded in the war were forced to serve.""(xiv)

So there you have it! Roosevelt wasn’t just picking on the Japanese. Even before the war he had the foresight to begin drafting young men (just in case the Japanese ever attacked in a surprise strike of which FDR had no expectation whatsoever). And by the end of the war he had forced nearly 200,000 young men to fight to their deaths! Compared to the conscripted war dead, the internees were lucky FDR didn’t kill them.

Malkin also points out that the United States wasn’t the only country to detain ""enemy aliens"" without trial. ""During World War II,"" she writes, ""virtually every major country — from Japan to Germany, from China to Egypt, from Holland to New Zealand — interned its enemy aliens."" (54)

Even the Germans and Japanese did it during World War II! So it’s not like the US government did something the Nazis weren’t willing to do.

FDR Destroyed the Bill of Rights, But Did He Save America?

Malkin explains somewhat convincingly that there were in fact Japanese Americans who sympathized with Japan. There was a startling incident on Niihaua Island when a whole handful of Japanese Hawaiians assisted a downed Japanese fighter pilot who planned to attack Pearl Harbor. And if even Hawaii — which the non-imperial United States had acquired fair and square, along with the Philippines, during the non-imperial Spanish American War — contained a few people who weren’t completely loyal to the United States, certainly no person of Japanese descent living in California could be trusted!

Malkin even shows that during the 1930s many Japanese Americans living in the continental United States tended to sympathize with Japan in its war against China. (This, of course, was treasonous, seeing as how the US government was supposed to be neutral, its support of the Flying Tigers in China notwithstanding.)

Malkin goes on, and on, and on, to show that (1) some Japanese Americans and ethnic Japanese living in America had loyalties to Japan, and (2) FDR was aware of Japanese espionage as a threat to America. In making this latter point, Malkin shows that government officials who opposed internment, like J. Edgar Hoover, were unaware of the US government having cracked the MAGIC code. On the other hand, the top leaders in the administration, such as War Secretary Henry Stimson, who were aware of the code breaking, also tended to support internment. Hmmm. I wonder if the same people were also privy to the naval code that revealed Japan was going to attack Pearl Harbor. How interesting, if the same people who knew about all these codes also happened to support Japanese internment. Hmmm. (Stimson was also strongly behind the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, unlike many leaders at the time. Hmmm. That Stimson character was always ahead of the game.)

All in all, Malkin’s obsessive attempts to prove a real threat of Japanese invasion or destruction of the US war effort are futile. As has been pointed out succinctly by Vox Day, there was no real threat of Japanese invasion, and FDR and his corrupt administration knew it.

Shattering the ""Concentration Camp"" ""Myth""

Malkin punctures the myth, supposedly believed far and wide, that FDR’s relocation centers were as bad as Nazi death camps. She explains:

""It is true that many politicians and public officials, including President Roosevelt himself, used the phrase u2018concentration camps’ to describe the relocation centers. But it wasn’t until the liberation of the Nazi death camps beginning in 1945 that the phrase took on the popular meaning that it retains today — that is, places of barbaric cruelty and torture on the order of what the Jews and others suffered under Hitler. In no way should the real suffering of ethnic Japanese evacuees and all Axis internees be minimized. But to compare American’s (sic) internment and relocation centers to the Third Reich’s extermination camps is to recklessly distort history and to trivialize the experience of Holocaust victims.""(96)

In other words, although FDR himself called them concentration camps, and although no one would really confuse them with Hitler’s concentration camps, and although we shouldn’t trivialize the suffering of FDR’s victims (though we should, of course, say such suffering was necessary), the fact is that calling them concentration camps, the way FDR did, distorts the way that we don’t look at history. Or something like that.

And thus, the ""myth"" of ""concentration camps"" blows away as surely as a man of straw.

Another myth, according to Malkin, is that Japanese internment was ""racist."" As she points out, the government also detained other people based on their national origins, not just Japanese. (Interestingly enough, she includes in her appendix an official Navy Department document from December 4, 1941, which details the Japanese ""Relations With The Negroes"": ""[I]t became apparent that representatives of the Japanese government in the United States were attempting to organize Negroes for the purpose of retarding National Defense efforts and to commit sabotage."" (223) See? The US government was neither paranoid nor racially motivated; it had a rational interest in national security, that’s all.)

Those Whining, Politically Correct Anti-Internment Fuzz-brains

Malkin describes in length how terrible it is that victims of Japanese internment received restitution for what they endured. In 1988, Ronald Reagan signed a bill that awarded $$1.65 billion in reparations. Malkin, the conservative FDR-lover, is quite harsh on Reagan for such irresponsible, leftist behavior. Just think of how many ""internment hotels"" $$1.65 billion could purchase. (Of course, as a libertarian, I think tax dollars shouldn’t go to FDR’s victims. Money from his estate should, followed by government assets if his estate is inadequate. I’d start with selling the FDR memorial.)

The Modern Lesson of Japanese (and non-Japanese) Relocation

The importance of reconsidering FDR’s concentration camps is that ""the prevailing view of World War II homeland defense measures has become the warped yardstick by which all War on Terror measures today are judged."" (xvii)

Of course, this is very true. Instead of looking at Roosevelt’s Japanese Internment, his Office of Censorship, his conscription of 10 million young men, his food rationing and nationalization of the economy, his civilian bombings, and his income tax withholding as bad things, we should realize that the U.S. government must do anything up to and including such extreme measures in order to protect us from outside enemies, no matter how dubious the threat and how irresponsible and dishonest our government officials.

We can’t let the ""political correctness"" exemplified by the knee-jerk opposition to rounding up tens of thousands of innocent people without due process and forcing them into camps disrupt our modern efforts to secure our nation. As Malkin says:

""In a time of war, the survival of the nations comes first. Civil liberties are not sacrosanct. The u2018unalienable rights’ that our Founding Fathers articulated do not appear in random order: Liberty and the pursuit of happiness cannot be secured and protected without securing and protecting life first."" (xiv)

Surely, during the American Revolution, when the Founders were championing free speech, the right to bear arms, and the right to a trial, they didn’t think such rights should interfere with the government’s priorities during wartime! It’s not like they ever had an enemy invasion to fear.

Malkin finds it un-American that some folks have been upset about Bush’s detainment of so many people without trial after 9/11. She doesn’t seem bothered by the fact that the administration has found virtually nobody worth accusing of a crime among the thousands detained unconstitutionally, and has been releasing prisoners who were apparently locked up all this time under harsh treatment for no reason.

Malkin cheers on the Supreme Court for upholding government secrecy after 9/11, indicates that the exclusionary rule and Miranda rights are anachronistic, and explains that America must make a choice between ""civil liberties or survival"":

""[In] times of crisis, civil rights often yield to security in order to ensure the nation’s survival. What is legal and what is necessary to preserve the Republic sometimes diverge…. In defying a Supreme Court order to restore habeas corpus, Lincoln refused to let the u2018government itself go to pieces’ for the sake a (sic) single law."" (163)

What ""single law"" was it that protected habeas corpus? Oh yeah, the Constitution — the document that brought the government into existence and supposedly gives it its power. We can’t let the Constitution get in the way of the government. To do so would be ""politically correct,"" right?

The Real Meaning of Malkin’s Book

It’s hard to know what Malkin is trying to say. On the one hand she says that Japanese Internment is a false analogy for what we face today, and yet she wrote a whole book on it laying out the parallels.

I gather one underlying lesson from the book: America as we know it is in great peril. Conservatives can be expected to hail and glorify Franklin Roosevelt, and defend some of his worst domestic policies. For many years Japanese Internment was one of the few government atrocities whose evil was really understood by most Americans, on the Left and Right. It was always a good example to explain to liberals why FDR was no saint, and why his other policies should be seriously reexamined. It was a good way of keeping in mind that it can happen here. When conservatives celebrate a book written to defend the most destructive and horrid president of the 20th century and his concentration camps, we’re in trouble.

If it’s ""politically correct"" to stand by the Bill of Rights and against the hysterically draconian policies of FDR and Bush II, I’m glad that, for once, the politically correct crowd is on the side of reason and liberty. It’s all for the good that FDR’s concentration camps are still taboo. Jefferson’s America was never meant to have Gulags, or anything close.

219687,"We’re having another “fin de bubble” feeling. The absurdities seem to be building up pressure, like a major steam pipe under the sidewalk; we thought it might burst up through the sidewalk at any moment.

What set us off was the rush of comment on China’s $$19.5 billion bid for Unocal.

The whole premise of America’s system of empire finance is that an American should be able to get what he yearns for, rather than what he actually earns. This desire is, of course, universal. It is like the desire to eat a lot without getting fat…or to take a trip to Las Vegas with your pretty secretary without upsetting your wife. But when you are the world’s Alpha Nation, getting something for nothing seems not only possible, but ordinary. It comes as a shock to realize that you may not be able to get away with it.

It was a “rough week,” said Reuters.

What made it rough was that both stocks and the dollar fell. Gasoline, meanwhile, rose to a record high early this morning and then came China with an offer to buy one of America’s leading oil companies. China is good for the money. It makes more than $$100 billion from its trade with the United States each year. And China has a strong motive to buy; its economy is growing rapidly.

The rough part is that the Chinese offer comes as a blow to Americans’ amour propre. They have wanted to believe that they were getting rich…that they are on top of the world…and that they have the world’s most dynamic and productive economy. And then along come the Chinese with billions of dollars in their hands, and a plan in their heads to take away a substantial part of America’s vital energy industry.

We read the papers everyday. Hardly a day goes by without a comment on outsourcing, globalization, or America’s global trade imbalance. But we doubt we have read more than one or two remarks that were not completely moronic. We checked again this weekend; the spell of imbecility continues.

First, our favorite columnist, Thomas L. Friedman, can’t understand why politicians are opposed to Cafta, the Central American Free Trade Agreement. He even turns to the consulting firm that advised Enron — McKinsey — to make his point: “Early movers in offshoring improve their cost position and boost their market share.” He goes on to say that it is better to compete with the Latin Americans than the Chinese, because when “a shirt that says ‘Made in Honduras’ might contain 60% U.S. content, while a similar shirt that says ‘Made in China’ most likely would have none.”

What Friedman does not understand, among many other things, is that a man always desires to be richer than his neighbors. He desires free trade only when it offers to widen the gap in his favor. Cafta will almost certainly make everyone a little richer; but it will probably do more for the Latin Americans than it will for the Norte Americanos. Relatively speaking, the yanqui will get poorer while the Latino gets richer. If the trend continues long enough, people in Great Falls will send their boys to Mexico City, not to manage hedges, but to trim them.

 The International Herald Tribune makes Friedman’s point in its weekend editorial: “The United States needs open, accessible markets.” In this, it is completely mistaken. The empire’s commercial peak has already crested. In open markets, it loses out to the faster-moving, lower- cost competitors — in Latin America as well as in Asia. This does not mean that it is really worse off because of globalization. Everyone is better off when people are free to work and trade as they please. But the empire suffers. It loses money. It loses good-paying jobs. Its absurdities are exposed. Its hallucinations…its delusions…its preposterous yearnings and conceits — all come to look a little passé and pathetic.

The IHT is particularly concerned about the Unocal deal. America imports 60% of its oil. Already, the oil price has risen over $$50 a barrel and looks like it will stay there. Gasoline is getting more expensive. And now China is competing for U.S. supplies directly — in the homeland itself.

The IHT’s solution to this ""problem"" is for the U.S. to use less oil. What a good idea! When the Chinese buy our grain and food companies, we suppose the paper will advise us to eat less, too. But while we laughed at the suggestion, the IHT came up with another solution that practically made our sides split: to raise taxes.

Not that there isn’t a certain logic to both suggestions. But it is the same kind of logic that led to the problem in the first place; rather than let nature take her course; we will make the situation worse. Chinese growth will mean higher oil prices. Higher prices will mean that Americans will be able to afford less of the stuff; they will use less. The IHT recommendation, that we use less oil, is no help. The other proposal — that taxes be raised — is similarly useless and unappealing. If you are afraid that Chinese competition will reduce Americans’ purchasing power, taking it away immediately — by taxation — doesn’t seem like much of a solution.

 Oil breaks the record high and creeps closer to $$61 a barrel…

Over the weekend, Iran chose a highly conservative president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, which leads to concerns that already strained Iran-U.S. relations could worsen.

“‘The Iranian election was just enough to get the market over the $$60 hump,’ said Phil Flynn, a senior analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago, referring to Ahmadinejad as a ‘hardliner’ whose election may ‘raise tension in the region.'”

The demand for oil is not waning in the United States, and Marketwatch.com asked Resource Trader Alert’s Kevin Kerr what he thinks about the refinery capacity state of affairs:

“The situation is grim, with refinery capacity and the condition of those refineries left in question,” said Kevin Kerr, president of Kerr Trading International.

“Bottom line is that these facilities have been running full tilt for months, and the [chances] of a repair problem or major outage or even a catastrophe are not only likely but highly probable,” he said.

Added to that, “if this week’s inventory levels show dramatic declines, we could be looking at $$63—$$65 crude oil,” he said.

 “My girlfriend in China informs me that the Shanghai residential property market is dropping like a stone. I rubbed my eyes when she emailed me that it has recently dropped 50%,” writes a faithful reader.

“It appears that many new developments remain empty, having been built on the back of a speculative market, and I surmise that oversupply is significant and visible now that demand is dropping.

“It made me recall for some bizarre reason a visit to the Forbidden City in Beijing. Many of the buildings on the inner courts of the City’s Palace complex are closed to visitors, and the buildings interiors can only be viewed through their windows. On my visit I was busy looking through one particular building window at some artifact of Imperial decadence, when I heard an excited commotion yards away from me in front of another window to the very same building.

“A growing crowd of about twenty people were bustling each other in a friendly but slightly manic way, to look through this one window, despite the fact that several other windows were adjacent affording a view of the same room. This window in question had the best view of the artifacts, but clearly any view was obtained by people at the expense of being bumped off by yet another person from behind trying to get through. The people at the back of the queue were steadily being joined by more people anxious to push through and find what they were missing out on.

“I looked on at an increasingly comic scene whilst more people attracted to the commotion pushed and shoved to get a view through this one window. This knot of good-humoured, but fevered human beings, boiled and surged in a self-sustaining thrash of human curiosity, despite the fact that the courtyard to the building was relatively empty and at least two other windows afforded an alternative view.

“It made me smile, and love the Chinese a bit more for being so silly, but it also seemed like a living metaphor for a bubble mentality. Needless to say, half an hour later you could gaze through the same window in perfect peace.”

For most gringos, Mexico is a place to retire. The Mexicans say, The Americans come here to die. Not exactly. It isn’t why they come, but it is what they do, there being eventually no choice. Everybody has to croak somewhere, so why not in the sunshine with little brown kids running back and forth and the street dogs lounging contentedly about? It beats, for some anyway, a wretched sanitarium and lots of tubes.

In the hills on the north side of town, where the nice houses are, you see aging couples like couples anywhere. It could be Lauderdale. They have each other and insurance and pensions and savings. In the bars you see the old single guys. They have close to nothing.

At nine in the morning they sit on green iron benches and wait for the cantinas to open. Little beyond white hair unites them in appearance. Some are thin, others fat, others whatever you can think of except moneyed. Drunks is not quite the right word for them. They are just old guys whose lives are spent and they sit around and drink beer and wait. It’s what they have. They seldom fall off stools or get into fights. They are anything but dangerous. They are just old guys with nothing, waiting.

Some would find them reprehensible. Why don’t they do something improving, learn to knit, or take up square dancing? This is harsh. What does a man do when he is seventy years old, his wife died eight years ago in Louisiana, and the trucking firm no longer wants him as a driver? Social Security and a small pension don’t go far in America. He comes to Ajijic and moves into the residential hotel, Italo’s, a block from the plaza and easy walking distance to the bars. It’s cheap and decent and the rooms come with kitchenette and the maids clean them. I’ve stayed there.

He’s seventy and tired, too old to learn a language and probably not of that bent anyway. He doesn’t want to learn to square dance. He is not looking for a cultural experience, not looking for much of anything. Women no longer interest him except as nice people, and anyway the diabetes doesn’t help in that department. So he talks to his friends. And he drinks. It takes the curse off. Besides, if he bothers no one else, it is the business of no one else — n’est-ce pas?

It is a mistake to think these men to be of no account because they are ending their days on a bar stool. They have had lives, traveled, drifted, worked, loved, had families or not, seen things and done things. Often they are intelligent and thoughtful. They are just through.

We live in a censorious age in America, an age of Gotcha! in which drinking looms loathsome, smoking is a crime to be punished, second-hand smoke a fearful threat to children and plants and wallpaper. Oh dear. We all must be vigilant for racism, sexism, and the rest. Psychologists call it passive aggressiveness, though I think that the Higher Priss does nicely. Well, I say, each to his or her or its own. Still, I have always found people who smoke and drink and do the occasional doob to be more interesting than those who don’t — certainly than the drab Comstocks of the current Carryan Nation.

So I’ll cut these guys some slack. You choose an exit door, or fall through one. They have. So will you.

Not all stay in one place. In Italo’s when I was there I met a guy well into his seventies who was about to get on a third-class bus to Guatemala, I think it was. He didn’t walk too well and moved as if he had sand in his joints. He seemed sad but was keeping his chin up. He knew a hotel in a nice town outside Guatemala City where the food was cheap and the young girls just so pretty. He meant nothing sexual. They were just pretty, like pictures. He liked watching them and the kids and Guatemala.

Now that’s rough, I thought. To be at the end of his days and bouncing around bad roads on a Guatemalan bus, alone, going where he probably knew nobody — that’s not the feather-bed route out the door. But he didn’t want to spend the winter in Ajijic. At least he was free. I wished him well.

Some drunks have other stories. There was a fellow, in his thirties I’d guess, who always wore a white cowboy hat and lied compulsively about what daring things he had done. This is common. It’s called border promotion. You know: I was a SEAL team leader before I was an astronaut, between being a fighter pilot and president of IBM. Sometimes it seems like half the gringo population used to be in the CIA.

Anyway, the guy with the white cowboy hat said he used to be a dead-end drunk, and had the tremor to prove it. But he was over it, he said, and in fact seemed to be. Then one night he got a ride home with somebody, pulled a pistol from somewhere, put it under his chin and blew the top of his head off. AIDS, or at least HIV. We make our choices. The consensus was that he should have done it somewhere else, where it wouldn’t have put a hole in the roof of the car and generally made a mess.

Sometimes one of the old guys will take up with a poor Mexican gal of twenty-five with four kids. They move in together. You could say that it was absurd, that neither knew the other’s language and he was a dirty old man and she a gold-digger. You could also try to exercise a little decency. Not everybody has choices. Usually he treats her well, puts food on the table, maybe gets her some dental work or insists that the kids go to school. It’s better than nothing. She cooks and keeps house and has a few years of security, and he leaves her whatever he can. I’ve seen such couples who seemed happy together. You play the hand you draw.

Things are different for those of intellectual resources, who take up photography seriously, fly ultralights, read, or keep on at whatever they did for a living at a reduced level. I’m not sure how different it is. They too are waiting. So are we all. But there were drunks before there were moralists, and I hope there will be drunks after, as they are so much less tedious, and closer to the human condition.

54707,"Looking at a French nationalist website Boulevard Voltaire this morning, I notice a repetition of the conventional American media account of what occurred in Charlottesville on Saturday. The news commentary explained that a white racist had run down and killed with a vehicle a thirty-two-year-old “anti-racist” demonstrator, Heather Heyer, while injuring other anti-racists who were protesting a “Unite the Right” rally in downtown Charlottesville. The supposed occasion for the demonstration, the removal of a twenty-six foot statue of Robert E. Lee, did not seem to interest the French commentator, although presumably if French anti-fascists were calling for dismantling statues of Charles de Gaulle or Joan of Arc all over France, the writer might have reacted differently. As an American observer of these events, who makes no bones about his utter revulsion for contemporary American “liberal” and “conservative” commentaries (which I find mostly indistinguishable), I think there’s more to the story of what went on in Charlottesville on Saturday than our authorized political sides want us to believe.

First of all, I find no heroes emerging from these events. The police showed no ability or perhaps no willingness to keep the two sides separated; and when they met it was inevitable that these armed partisans who hated each other’s guts would clash. Although the dismantling of Lee’s statue (in May a judge placed a six-month stay on this outrage) may have been only the pretext for obnoxious youth to raise holy Hell, the removal of Confederate statues and the renaming of parks and streets commemorating Confederate commanders is sheer lunacy. It should be opposed by all possible legal means. The NAACP and leftist cranks like Max Boot who push this agenda are the American equivalent of the Taliban. Are we supposed to do the PC cringe again when the usual pests demand that we remove the names of Jefferson, Madison and Washington from every city in this country because our country’s Founders owned slaves?

Time to buy old US gold coins

As for the bloody clash in Charlottesville, it’s impossible for me to read the account provided by neocon princeling John Podhoretz in the New York Post this morning without losing my breakfast. The villain for Podhoretz (as it always is these days when’s he’s not attacking critics of the Likud Party) is Donald Trump who refused “to denounce Nazis and white supremacists unqualifiedly and by name.” It seems that Trump had the “shamelessness” to suggest that there were two sides involved in the clash in Charlottesville. (Donald Trump has since unloaded all his fire on Pod’s target.) The anti-fascist and BLM protestors, according to Podhoretz’s doctored narrative, were merely “responding” to hate; and the president whom Podhoretz wouldn’t back against Hillary and whom he continues to denounce “refused to name the evil in our midst,” thereby showing “the behavior of a man whose moral sense is stunted.” On Saturday evening, Fox-news offered an interview by Julie Banderas of a Weekly Standard senior editor who scolded Trump for not treating the Altright in the same denunciatory manner as ISIS. Both, according to Ms. Torrance, were equally dangerous terrorist organizations.

Needless to say, I’ve never heard our authorized conservative opposition vent the same ferocious denunciations they’re now showing on anti-fascist vandals or on the Bernie Sanders supporter who tried to kill a crew of Republican Congressmen while practicing for a baseball game in Arlington, Virginia. Nor did the authorized leftist media agonize in the same way about left-wing extremism as Fox-news commentators did when they began screeching on Saturday night about right-wing dangers that are comparable to ISIS. The Left acted according to script, when their commentators tried to blame the attempted annihilation of Republican Congressmen on our right-wing extremist president.

But our bogus Right couldn’t leave their pandering to the Left with calls for special vigilance against a pervasive right-wing danger. On Fox’s Judge Jeanine segment we had the pleasure of listening to various Republican Congressmen from Virginia defining their “conservatism” as some kind of diversitarian globalist fantasy. One Latino Republican Congressman described the US as the world’s greatest multicultural success. All the Republican interviewees gave the impression that Charlottesville had been a sleepy serene college town, like a throwback to Monty Wooly’s “Halls of Ivy,” before it was invaded by neo-Nazis. These saccharine comments revealed little about the reality of life in an area controlled by the PC Left and led by a bona fide leftist radical from New York City, Mayor Mike Signer.

I’ve also come to doubt that the group organized by Richard Spencer et al was more responsible for violence than the anti-fascist side. From the film I’ve just seen it seems conclusive that leftist thugs were at least as ready to rumble as were the white nationalists and neo-Nazis. Whether or not the Left initiated the fisticuffs (and there’s a high probability that it did) those who led it were far from naïve humanitarians who were “shocked” by white racists. Moreover, both sides, including the white nationalists, integrated into their demonstrations basically decent people, who were simply reacting against something they found intolerable, such as a PC police state or neo-Nazi symbols. Such people were used by others on both sides who were looking for trouble. And the police did little to prevent it.

Finally I would observe as a representative of the independent Right that Richard Spencer and his friends did us a horrible disservice by contributing to the confrontation that took place on Saturday. Much of what Richard and other members of the Altright say about the growing indistinguishability of our authorized Right and authorized Left is entirely on the mark. But the way to combat this deplorable situation is not to team up with Nazis and encourage demonstrators to come armed to Charlottesville to protest the leftist Taliban. One has to create a counter-media to what our shared enemies have done and be willing to accept decent people, whatever their race, to combat left-wing totalitarians and fake conservative enablers.

The war for civilization is almost entirely between groups of whites, in fact mostly white Christians. The white Left has drawn in other groups, but mostly as auxiliary forces. The same battle would be going on, as it has been in much of Europe, if we were only dealing with white opponents. None of the multiculturalists I have known has been black; and calling white multicultural fanatics “race traitors” is a gross oversimplification because the object of leftist hate goes well beyond their own racial group. It now includes all normal people who have not been reconstructed by the managerial therapeutic state or are fighting the scourge of Political Correctness. At the very least, Richard and his comrades have diverted us from this fight and compounded this injury by playing a role in the violence that should not have occurred.

I can’t help asking this rhetorical question, at least parenthetically at the end. According to white nationalist protocol, am I supposed to ally with white cultural leftists against the very black African Cardinal Robert Sarah, who spoke yesterday in Brittany? The good cardinal affirmed his reverence for the Vendean martyrs who fought for their king and church against the evil French Revolution. Needless to say the ideology that Cardinal Sarah decried was far less radically leftist than what our fake conservatives proclaim as their global democratic agenda. The struggle to restore a decent society that we’re in cannot and should not be reduced to racial differences.

369613,"As even Karl Marx once reluctantly admitted, the capitalist system has created more wealth (and more quickly) than any other economic system in history. Yet, despite its obvious success (or, perhaps, because of it), the system is poorly understood and almost never loved. And this ignorance and lack of affection (for self-interest and profit and competition) always makes capitalism vulnerable (especially during recessions) to crack-pot schemes and reforms that strike at the root of its economic performance.

In the current economic downturn, “bailouts” to financial firms (AIG, Citi Bank) and industrial corporations (GM, Chrysler) are the nuttiest of the current crop of government policies and they promise to inflict the most lasting damage on taxpayers, consumers, and on the economy as a whole. Regardless of their intent, they are a serious economic mistake because they cut to the very heart of the capitalist process.

To see why this is so, it must be noted that the search for profit and the avoidance of loss is the essence of the capitalist process. In a market economy, individuals and firms have incentives to discover products and services that consumers want and then produce them at the lowest cost. Profits become a signal of success and a reward for serving consumers efficiently. Contrariwise, when losses appear, they signal failure and inflict a penalty on firms for producing poor products or having bloated costs of production.

Firms that make profits can command additional resources (land, labor, capital) and expand production. Investors who took the risks of production are rewarded. On the other hand, firms that make losses must release resources (land, labor, capital) and ought to curtail production; their investors are penalized. This, then, is the capitalistic process whereby consumers get the products and services they want produced efficiently.

Since market information is never perfect and since production is always future oriented, the capitalistic process is “messy” and is never in any equilibrium; this reality must be accepted. What cannot be accepted is market fraud (especially in accounting for profit and loss) and deceptive practices; these serve to undermine the integrity of the entire process and must be carefully policed. (Think Bernie Madoff.) Nonetheless, the capitalistic process of profit and loss (with fraud protection) just described has worked with more personal freedom and more beneficial results than any other economic system in history.

The recent and on-going government bailouts (begun under President Bush and continued under President Obama) are antithetical to the capitalistic process. First, they weaken both the information and incentives necessary for efficient production. Second, they delay tough decisions by management in a whole variety of areas such as product design, employment, dealer and store closings, future investments, and even bankruptcy. Finally, profitable firms in an industry are put at a competitive disadvantage because of the subsidies to the losers; this is both unfair and inefficient. All of these perverse incentives work to prolong and deepen recessions, not shorten them.

In addition, what governments fund they (naturally) wish to control. So bailouts often come with strings and conditions concerning future business operations (salaries, plant closings, etc.). The assumption here is that the Treasury or the Congress (think Barney Frank) can craft a better plan for any future corporate recovery than can the market or a bankruptcy court. But this assumption is unwarranted and has no support in either theory or empirical evidence.

The huge credit bubble spawned by the Federal Reserve created expectations about future production and consumption that could not be sustained. That it all came crashing down was inevitable. Recessions (actually economic corrections) end when consumers and business finally readjust their respective “balance sheets” to the new price and profit reality. Bailouts delay and distort this adjustment process and thus make the recovery longer and more difficult.

is chapter four of Jeff Riggenbach’s new book, Why

American History Is Not What They Say: An Introduction to Revisionism.

The preface, table of contents, etc. are here.

I: The U.S.

Civil War — the Revisionist View

As Gore Vidal

presents it in Lincoln, the U.S. Civil War was caused, not

by slavery, but by the intransigence of President Lincoln, who insisted

adamantly that no state could legitimately secede from the Union

and that the Union could never be broken up. In Vidal's account,

Lincoln cared nothing for the plight of the slaves. Nor did he

care about the U.S. Constitution's guarantees of individual liberty:

he shut down newspapers that opposed the war, imprisoning their

editors; he held prisoners indefinitely, flouting habeas corpus;

he imposed the first military draft in the nation's history, then

used troops to crush the riots that resulted; he financed his war

by imposing and collecting the nation's first tax on incomes, despite

the lack of any constitutional basis for such a levy.

Vidal might

well have found inspiration for such a view of the war in the writings

of Charles Beard and William Appleman Williams. For, as Beard wrote

in 1927 in Volume II of The Rise of American Civilization,

Since […]

the abolition of slavery never appeared in the platform of any

great political party, since the only appeal ever made to the

electorate on that issue was scornfully repulsed, since the spokesman

of the Republicans emphatically declared that his party never

intended to interfere with slavery in the states in any shape

or form, it seems reasonable to assume that the institution of

slavery was not the fundamental issue during the epoch preceding

the bombardment of Fort Sumter. [200]

Williams agreed.

In his Contours of American History (1961), he wrote that

u201Cneither Lincoln nor the majority of northerners entered the war

in an abolitionist frame of mind or entertaining abolitionist objectives.u201D [201] Williams is even more explicit in his

1976 book America Confronts a Revolutionary World: 1776-1976.

u201CPut simply,u201D he writes, u201Cthe cause of the Civil War was the refusal

of Lincoln and other northerners to honor the revolutionary right

of self-determination — the touchstone of the American Revolution.u201D

And this was rank hypocrisy on Lincoln's part, according to Williams,

for on January 12, 1848, the Great Emancipator had intoned:

Any people

anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the right

to rise up, and shake off the existing government, and form a

new one that suits them better. […] Nor is this right confined

to cases in which the whole people of an existing government may

choose to exercise it. Any portion of such people that can,

may revolutionize, and make their own, of so much

of the territory as they inhabit. [202]

Joseph R.

Stromberg, the historian who touched off the current wave of serious

revisionist investigation of the U.S. Civil War among libertarian

scholars, had read both Beard and Williams. And in his influential

essay, u201CThe War for Southern Independence: A Radical Libertarian

Perspective,u201D published in 1979, while he was still a Ph.D. candidate

at the University of Florida, he staked out a position even more

radical than anything either Beard or Williams had ever proposed

— something very like the vision of the war laid out in Gore Vidal's

Lincoln. Stromberg didn't go into a lot of detail in presenting

his take on the war, but two other Libertarian historians have done

so. These are Jeffrey Rogers Hummel, in Emancipating Slaves,

Enslaving Free Men (1996), and Thomas J. DiLorenzo, in The

Real Lincoln: A New Look at Abraham Lincoln, His Agenda, and an

Unnecessary War (2002).

Hummel's view

of the Civil War is remarkably like Vidal's. u201CHistorians and buffs

debate the fundamental causes of the American Civil War almost as

hotly today as the combatants did then,u201D he writes. u201CWe can simplify

our understanding of the Civil War's causes, however, if we follow

the advice of one eminent historian, Eric Foner, and ask two separate

questions. Why did the southern states want to leave the Union?

And why did the northern states refuse to let them go?u201D These are

two separate questions, Hummel insists, because u201C[e]ven if slavery

explains why the southern states left the Union, it does not necessarily

either explain or justify the national government's refusal to recognize

their independence.u201D In fact, he maintains, u201C[n]ot only does slavery

fail to explain why the northern states resorted to coercion, but

letting the lower South go in peace was a viable, untried antislavery

option. As the most militant abolitionists themselves demonstrated,

there was no contradiction between condemning slavery and advocating

secession.u201D [203]



In fact, as

Hummel points out, one of the most prominent leaders of the abolitionist

movement, William Lloyd Garrison, editor of the weekly abolitionist

paper The Liberator and one of the organizers of the leading

abolitionist organization, the American Anti-Slavery Society, was

an enthusiastic proponent of secession — for the North. Garrison

and his followers u201Cfelt that this best hastened the destruction

of slavery by allowing the free states to get out from under the

Constitution's fugitive slave provision.u201D The seceded North, in

Garrison's vision, would have u201Cbecome a haven for runaway slaves.u201D [204]

Why did President

Lincoln choose another path — the use of military force against

the seceded Southern states? In August of 1862, according to Hummel,

Lincoln answered this question. u201CMy paramount object in this struggle,u201D

the president said,

is

to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy

slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any

slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all

the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some

and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about

slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps

to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do

not believe it would help save the Union. [205]

In effect,

Lincoln refused to allow, first the lower South, then the entire

Confederacy, to go in peace because he was committed to a conception

of the United States as a perpetual nation, with whose central government

the component states had no right to end their association — he

was committed, not to a voluntary Union, but to a compulsory one.

In defense

of this compulsory Union, according to DiLorenzo,

Lincoln implemented

a series of unconstitutional acts, including launching an invasion

of the South without consulting Congress, as required by the Constitution;

declaring martial law; blockading the Southern ports; suspending

the right of habeas corpus for the duration of his administration;

imprisoning without trial thousands of Northern citizens;

arresting and imprisoning newspaper publishers who were critical

of him; censoring all telegraph communication; nationalizing the

railroads; creating several new states without the consent of

the citizens of those states; ordering Federal troops to interfere

with elections in the North by intimidating Democratic voters;

deporting a member of Congress, Clement L. Vallandigham of Ohio,

for criticizing the administration's income tax proposal at a

Democratic Party rally; confiscating private property; confiscating

firearms in violation of the Second Amendment; and effectively

gutting the Ninth and Tenth amendments to the Constitution, among

other things. [206]



u201COne victim

of Lincoln's suppression of Northern newspapers,u201D DiLorenzo writes,

u201Cwas Francis Key Howard of Baltimore, the grandson of Francis Scott

Key.u201D Howard spent u201Cnearly two years in a military prison without

being charged and without a trial of any kind.u201D u201CFort Lafayette

in New York Harbor,u201D he notes, u201Ccame to be known as the u2018American

Bastille' because it housed so many political prisoners during the

Lincoln administration.u201D At one point, u201CFort Lafayette was filled

with newspaper editors from all over the country who had questioned

the wisdom of Lincoln's military invasion and his war of conquest.u201D

[207]

DiLorenzo

quotes Clinton Rossiter in support of his contention that Lincoln's

war policies were widely regarded as unconstitutional even at the

time of their original enactment: u201CThis amazing disregard for the…Constitution

was considered by nobody as legal.u201D That being the case, however,

one must wonder how Lincoln explained his policies to the people

around him at the time. According to DiLorenzo, the president

u201Cjustifiedu201D

his unconstitutional power grab by u201Cdiscoveringu201D presidential

powers in the Constitution that no previous president, or, indeed,

anyone at all, had ever noticed. Specifically, he claimed that

the commander-in-chief clause of the Constitution, when combined

with the duty of the president to u201Ctake care that the laws be

faithfully executed,u201D gave him carte blanche in ignoring any and

all laws, and the Constitution itself, in the name of presidential

u201Cwar powers.u201D [208]

It will be

noted that DiLorenzo indulges a marked taste for the polemical and

tends toward more than a bit of hyperbole in his writing. Lincoln

does not seem really to have believed that he had u201Ccarte blanche

in ignoring any and all laws,u201D for example; he does seem, however,

to have believed that he had carte blanche to ignore those laws

he felt were in conflict with what he saw as his duty — to save

the Union, price no object. DiLorenzo has also been accused, by

more than one reviewer, of u201Ccareless errors of fact, misuse of sources,

and faulty documentation.u201D Richard M. Gamble details these technical

criticisms of DiLorenzo's book at some length in the Spring 2003

issue of The Independent Review, and regards them as evidence

of a serious problem with DiLorenzo's scholarship. But even he

concedes that u201Cindividually these flaws may seem trivial and inconsequential.u201D

[209] And so they do: a quotation cited as being on page 60

is in fact on page 61; information attributed to page 316 of a work

by a noted Lincoln scholar is instead to be found on the same page

of another work by the same scholar; an article cited as having

been published in 1988 was in fact published in 1998. Not only

are errors of this type (unfortunate though they are) both trivial

and inconsequential, but also not a few of them would appear to

have resulted from proofreading errors, which can hardly be blamed

on the author. In any case, as Peter Novick notes, u201Cwhen citations

[…] are illustrative of a synthetic interpretation arrived at through

u2018deep immersion,' even the demonstration that several citations

are faulty is far from constituting a refutation of the thesis they

underpin.u201D [210] And as Gamble himself

acknowledges, DiLorenzo's book u201Cis essentially correct in every

charge it makes against Lincoln,u201D and is, apart from its too numerous

technical errors, u201Ca sobering study in power and corruption.u201D

[211]

II: America

in the World Wars — A Revisionist Perspective

As Gore Vidal

presents it in Hollywood, American intervention in World

War I was engineered by the United States' Anglophile president,

Woodrow Wilson, who was always eager to help the British out of

any pickle they might have got themselves into. Even after creating

a special office of wartime propaganda to u201Csellu201D the war to the

American public, however — and after following the lead of Lincoln

and forcibly silencing those publishers who dared disagree with

his policies — Wilson still found it necessary to force young American

men into the U.S. army through a revival of the military draft;

too few of them were volunteering to come to England's aid.

When Vidal

researched the war, he could well have found all the intellectual

ammunition he needed to defend such a view in the works of the Progressive

historians, especially Harry Elmer Barnes. Barnes has been discussed

as a u201Csecond-generationu201D practitioner of the u201CNew Historyu201D pioneered

by James Harvey Robinson and Charles A. Beard. But, as Novick points

out,

u201CNew Historiansu201D

is a designation generally given to the Columbia group around

Robinson and Beard, and one which emphasizes methodology; u201CProgressive

Historiansu201D describes a descent from [Frederick Jackson] Turner

and Beard, and emphasizes substantive interpretations of American

history. The usage employed in the historiographical literature

generally depends on the subject under discussion. Because Turner

prefigured many New Historical themes, and Robinson, though a

Europeanist, was the ultimate Progressive, all three of these

men — plus [Carl] Becker, the student of both Turner and Robinson,

and an u201Cassociate memberu201D of both groups — are here treated as

both New and Progressive historians.

[212]

I follow Novick's

lead in this matter, reasoning that, since both Beard and his protg

Barnes were consistent advocates of Progressive reform, as well

as advocates of the use of the social sciences to inform historical

scholarship, they may be treated as both New and Progressive Historians.

Beard, writing

in 1930 in The Rise of American Civilization, characterized

the u201Cofficial thesisu201D as to the origins of World War I in the following

way:

Germany and

Austria, under autocratic war lords, had long been plotting and

preparing for the day when they could overwhelm their neighbors

and make themselves masters of the world. England, France, and

Russia, on the other hand, all unsuspecting, had pursued ways

of innocence, had sincerely desired peace, and made no adequate

preparations for a great cataclysm. When England and France were

trying to preserve equal rights for all in Morocco, Germany had

rattled the sword and now, taking advantage of the controversy

over the assassination of the Austrian archduke, the Central Powers

had leaped like tigers upon their guileless victims. [213]

Earlier, in

a 1926 article for Current History, Beard had been even more

sardonic: the conventional view of the war's origins, he wrote,

amounted to the claim that u201Cthree pure and innocent boys — Russia,

France and England — without military guile in their hearts, were

suddenly assailed while on the way to Sunday school by two deep-dyed

villains — Germany and Austria — who had long been plotting cruel

deeds in the dark.u201D

[214] By 1926, Barnes had long since recognized this story

as so much twaddle, and by 1930 his old mentor had come entirely

over to his side of the question.

And Barnes's

side of the question was rather different. He wrote in 1926 in

The Genesis of the World War, that

the only

direct and immediate responsibility for the World War falls upon

France and Russia, with the guilt about equally distributed.

Next in order — far below France and Russia — would come Austria,

though she never desired a general European war. Finally, we

should place Germany and England as tied for last place, both

being opposed to war in the 1914 crisis. Probably the German

public was somewhat more favorable to military activities than

the English people, but […] the Kaiser made much more strenuous

efforts to preserve the peace of Europe in 1914 than did Sir Edward

Grey. [215]

As for U.S.

intervention in the war, the reasons for it, Barnes wrote in 1928

in In Quest of Truth and Justice: De-Bunking the War-Guilt Myth,

were u201Cmany and complex.u201D One factor was u201Cthe pro-British sources

of most of our news concerning Germany in the decade prior to 1914.u201D

Another was the u201Cenormous sumsu201D lent to Allied governments by American

bankers. Another was the simple fact that President u201CWilson was

[…]very pro-British in his cultural sympathies. […] He did not

desire to have the United States enter the war if England seemed

likely to win without our aid, but as soon as this appeared doubtful

he was convinced that we should enter as early as he could persuade

Congress and the country to follow him.u201D u201CLater,u201D Barnes added,

u201CMr. Wilson added to his pro-British reasons for desiring to enter

the War the conception that unless he was at the Peace Conference

he could not act decisively in bringing about a peace of justice

and permanence.u201D Unfortunately, u201C[t]here can be little doubt that

the entry of the United States into the World War was an unmitigated

disaster for all concerned. It made it possible for one set of

combatants to win a crushing victory, whereas, as Mr. Wilson once

wisely said, the only enduring peace would have to be a peace without

victory.u201D [216]

Earlier, in

The Genesis of the World War, Barnes had seen another motive,

something different from the desire to build a u201Cpeace of justice

and permanence,u201D behind Wilson's change of heart on U.S. participation

in the war. He saw lust for power. He suggested that u201CWilson's

decision was affected by the conviction that he could assume world

leadership only if he led the United States into the war.u201D [217] In 1948, looking back,

Charles Beard saw a closely related sort of megalomania lurking

behind Wilson's benign, professorial visage — the delusion u201Cthat

the President of the United States has the constitutional and moral

right to proclaim noble sentiments of politics, economics, and peace

for the whole world and commit the United States to these sentiments

by making speeches and signing pieces of paper on his own motion.u201D

[218] In 1939, Beard recalled the violence Wilson had done

to the Constitution in the service of his megalomaniacal vision:

u201CI saw the freedom of the press trampled by gangs of spies, public

and private.u201D [219]

Thirteen years earlier, in 1926, in History and Social

Intelligence, Barnes, too, had noted the domestic consequences

of Wilson's commitment of U.S. troops to the European war — the

fact that, in prosecuting his war, the president had u201Csanctioned

[…] the most serious inroads upon democratic practice and human

liberty in the history of our country, wiping out in three years

most of the solid gains of a century and a half of struggle against

arbitrary power.u201D

[220]

In Barnes's

view, the Versailles Treaty that ended the war, based as it was

on the very u201Ccharge of German war guiltu201D that had since been exposed

as arrant nonsense, was so grossly unfair to Germany as almost to

guarantee a resumption of hostilities within a few years at best. [221] And, of course, hostilities did resume

in the 1930s. When they did, both Beard and Barnes were wary of

any analysis of current events that appeared to see merit in another

U.S. intervention. Had nothing been learned from the experience

of World War I?, they wondered.

Gore Vidal

must have wondered much the same thing. As he depicts it in The

Golden Age, American intervention in the new European War began

as a move to protect and advance the interests of England, this

time with a fully conscious and deliberate eye on the main chance

of replacing England as the leading world power. Specifically,

Vidal depicts U.S. intervention in the new war as the result of

a plot by President Roosevelt to provoke the Japanese into attacking

U.S. territory, thereby justifying the president's pre-existing

intention to break his campaign promise not to send American boys

to die in any foreign war. Again, Vidal would have needed to look

no farther than the works of Beard and Barnes to draw such conclusions.

In 1939, in an article in Harper's magazine, Beard argued

that

[t]he era

of universal American jitters over foreign affairs of no vital

interest to the United States was opened in full blast about 1890

by four of the most powerful agitators that ever afflicted any

nation: Alfred Thayer Mahan, Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge

and Albert J. Beveridge. These were the chief manufacturers of

the new doctrine correctly characterized as u201Cimperialism for Americau201D

[…] the policy of running out and telling the whole world just

the right thing to do.

[222]

President Franklin

Roosevelt now appeared to be falling for the lure of this policy,

Beard reported in February 1941, when he testified before the Senate

Committee on Foreign Relations against the Lend-Lease Bill, calling

it

an Act to

place all the wealth and all the men and women of the United States

at the free disposal of the President, to permit him to transfer

or carry goods to any foreign government he may be pleased to

designate, anywhere in the world, to authorize him to wage undeclared

wars for anybody, anywhere in the world, until the affairs of

the world are ordered to suit his policies, and for any other

purpose he may have in mind now or at any time in the future,

which may be remotely related to the contingencies contemplated

in the title of this Act.

Beard proposed

u201Cthat Congress reject this bill with such force that no President

of the United States will ever dare again, in all our history, to

ask it to suspend the Constitution and the laws of this land and

to confer upon him limitless dictatorial powers over life and death.u201D [223]

It was in

the service of this imperialistic conception of the U.S. role in

world affairs, Beard thundered in that 1939 Harper's article,

that u201CPresident Roosevelt […] was maneuvering his country into the

war.u201D Convinced that FDR had set up the defenders of Pearl Harbor

for a Japanese attack he had deliberately provoked, while making

sure that no one in Hawaii knew of it in advance as he himself did,

Beard u201Cfollowed the course of the congressional investigation of

Pearl Harbor with an almost microscopic scrutiny. To what the investigation

brought forth he added more that he gathered himself,u201D publishing

his final statement on the matter in President Roosevelt and

the Coming of the War, 1941 (1948), only a few months before

his death. This book, according to George R. Leighton, Beard's

editor at Harper's, u201Cwas a ponderous volume in which, with

detail and fact piled upon detail and fact until the weight is almost

crushing, Beard sought to nail down the proof of Roosevelt's deception

so firmly that it could not be got loose.u201D [224]

Five years

later, in 1953, Beard's longtime protg Harry Elmer Barnes published

Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace: A Critical Examination of

the Foreign Policy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Its Aftermath,

dedicated u201Cto the memory of Charles Austin Beard.u201D In this volume,

Barnes wrote that u201CAmerican policy toward Japan in the decade preceding

Pearl Harbor […] was the same hostile policy developed by Stimson

during the latter part of the Hoover Administration. It was rejected

by President Hoover but was adopted and continued by Roosevelt.u201D

According to Barnes, FDR u201Cdiscussed war with Japan in his earliest

cabinet meetings,u201D immediately commenced u201Can unprecedented peacetime

expansion of our naval forces,u201D u201Claid plans for a naval blockade

of Japan in 1937,u201D and relentlessly pursued a u201Cprogram for the economic

strangulation of Japanu201D that u201Cwas generally recognized by Washington

authoritiesu201D at the time as likely to lead to war. u201CRoosevelt was

personally responsible,u201D Barnes wrote, u201Cfor the location of our

Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, in which move he disregarded the

advice of Admirals Richardson and Stark. The State Department backed

Roosevelt and Richardson was relieved of his command.u201D

[225]

u201CJapan veritably

crawled on its diplomatic belly,u201D Barnes wrote, u201Cfrom the end of

August, 1941, until after the middle of November of that year in

an attempt to reach some workable understanding with the United

States. The effort met with cold and hostile rebuffs.u201D Finally,

Secretary

Hull dispatched an ultimatum to Japan on November 26 which, he

fully recognized, decisively closed the door to peace. He himself

said that it took the Japanese situation out of diplomacy and

handed it over to the Army and Navy. From this time onward it

was only a question of when and where the Japanese would attack.

u201CThe decoded

Japanese messages between November 26 and December 7 indicated,

with relative certainty, when the attack would be made, and they

also revealed the strong probability that it would be aimed at Pearl

Harbor.u201D Yet u201Cnothing was done to warn General Short or Admiral

Kimmel at Pearl Harbor.u201D

[226]

The president,

Barnes wrote

expressed

himself as greatly u201Csurprisedu201D at both the time and place of the

attack, and his apologists have accepted these words at their

face value. Neither the President nor his apologists have ever

given any satisfactory explanation of why he could have been surprised.

[…] If they had any reason at all to be surprised, it was only

over the extent of the damage inflicted by the Japanese. But

there was little reason even for this, in the light of Roosevelt's

personal order to keep the fleet bottled up like a flock of wooden

ducks, of the order that no decoding machine should be sent to

Pearl Harbor, and of the fact that Washington had deliberately

failed to pass on to Short and Kimmel any of the alarming information

intercepted during the three days before the attack. December

7 may have been a u201Cday of infamy,u201D but the infamy was not all

that of Japan. [227]

III: A Revisionist

Look at America in the Cold War

As Gore Vidal

depicts it in The Golden Age, the Cold War was started by

the United States, by a Truman administration determined to show

Joe Stalin who was boss of the postwar world. When Vidal researched

the Cold War, he could, once again, have found much intellectual

ammunition in the work of Harry Elmer Barnes. The conventional

historical account of the origins of the Cold War places much emphasis

on the warlike and imperialistic intentions of the Soviet Union,

to which the United States was forced, reluctantly, to respond.

Barnes would have none of this. In 1953, in his essay u201CHow Nineteen

Eighty-four Trends Threaten American Peace, Freedom, and Prosperity,u201D

he wrote that

the Russia

which is now portrayed as about to spring at the world and devour

it is the same Russia that Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, and other

administration leaders presented to the American public as our

most potent and suitable ally in the global struggle to suppress

totalitarianism, assure democracy, promote liberty, and make peace

secure throughout the world. There is very little today in Russian

policy, domestic or foreign, which any informed person did not

know about back in 1941. In fact, nothing which Russia has done

since 1945 has been as aggressive and brutal as the invasion of

Poland in the autumn of 1939, the later mass murders of Polish

officers in the Katyn Forest in 1940, or the mass murders and

deportations of Baltic peoples during the war.

Barnes considered

the likelihood of the Soviet Union making war against the United

States to be extremely remote. u201CEven leading Russophobes like Eugene

Lyons,u201D he wrote, u201Cfrankly admit that there is every reason to expect

that Russia will not start a war.u201D Moreover, he pointed out, when

General Alfred M. Gruenther, General Eisenhower's chief of staff,

testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 25,

1952, he too u201Cconceded that he did not believe the Russians will

start a war, now or at any time.u201D

[228]

But if it

was not Soviet aggression that launched the Cold War, what did launch

it? u201CBarnes concluded that it was initiated by Truman and Churchill,

largely for domestic political reasons, and since then has been

used by each of the various governments to cement its rule over

its subjects.u201D [229] What Barnes seems to have

regarded as the first official act of the Cold War, Truman's decision

to drop the newly developed atomic bomb on the Japanese cities of

Hiroshima and Nagasaki, is depicted in conventional accounts of

American history as primarily a military decision — an attempt to

force Japanese surrender without the necessity of an invasion of

the islands and a prolonged land war on Japanese soil, with its

attendant American casualties, possibly numbering in the millions.

Again, Barnes would have none of this. In May 1958, he published

an article in National Review called u201CHiroshima: Assault

on a Beaten Foe,u201D in which he pointed to

the highly

significant MacArthur memorandum to F.D.R. of January 20, 1945.

This forty-page memorandum explicitly set forth the terms of an

authentic Japanese peace offer which were virtually identical

with the final surrender terms that we accepted from the Japanese

seven months later — at the cost of countless needlessly expended

lives, Japanese and American alike.

In the same

article, u201CBarnes also disclosed, for the first time, the personal

testimony of Herbert Hoover that President Truman, by early May,

1945, informed him that he knew of the extensive Japanese peace

offers and admitted then that further fighting with the Japanese

was really unnecessary.u201D Barnes concluded u201Cthat the major reason

for dropping the bomb […] was a sabre-rattling gesture to the Russians

against whom we were already preparing the Cold War.u201D [230]

A very similar

view of the Cold War had already been articulated by this time byWilliam

Appleman Williams. In 1952, in his first book, American-Russian

Relations, 1781-1947,

[c]ontradicting

the prevailing notion that the Cold War had come about through

the actions of an aggressive and expansionist Soviet Union, Williams

argued that the United States itself bore the primary responsibility.

Even before Pearl Harbor, he wrote, American policymakers had

committed themselves to achieving a postwar world dominated by

an alliance between Great Britain and the United States. By attempting

to force upon Russia this Anglo-American world order without regard

to her minimum security needs, American leaders forced an essentially

conservative Soviet Union into acting unilaterally in her own

defense.

Among the methods

Williams claimed American leaders had used in pressuring the Soviets

was u201Cbrandishing atomic weapons.u201D

[231]

Williams's

student, Gar Alperovitz, who earned his B.S. in History at the University

of Wisconsin in 1959, took his old teacher's argument and ran with

it, devoting two entire books to presenting the relevant details

and working out their implications. The first of these books, Atomic

Diplomacy: Hiroshima and Potsdam, the Use of the Atomic Bomb and

the American Confrontation with Soviet Power, was published

in 1965; the second, The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb and

the Architecture of an American Myth, appeared thirty years

later, in 1995. According to Robert James Maddox, Atomic Diplomacy

is devoted

to showing that from the time Harry S. Truman assumed the presidency

he undertook to reverse Franklin D. Roosevelt's policy of cooperation

with the Soviet Union, thereby precipitating the Cold War. In

direct violation of wartime agreements, some explicit and some

understood, Truman sought to construct an American-dominated world

order (particularly in Eastern Europe and the Far East) at the

end of World War II. When economic coercion failed to achieve

this goal, Alperovitz claimed, Truman bided his time until the

United States acquired the atomic bomb, with which he meant to

cow the Russians into submission. The use of nuclear weapons

against an already defeated Japan, according to this view, amounted

to a diplomatic rather than a military act. The evidence u201Cstrongly

suggests,u201D he wrote, that the bombs were used primarily to demonstrate

to the Russians the enormous power America would have in its possession

during subsequent negotiations. As a lesser factor, he cited

the wish to end the war quickly before they [the Soviets] could

establish a strong position in the Far East. [232]

To quote Alperovitz

himself, from one of his Cold War Essays (1970), u201Cthe over-riding

reason for the use of the bomb was that (implicitly or explicitly)

it was judged necessary to strengthen the United States's hand against

Russia.u201D Commenting in the same essay on Herbert Feis's then newly

published book, The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II (1966),

Alperovitz stresses the author's establishment credentials — u201Cspecial

consultant to three Secretaries of War,u201D u201Ccomes close to being our

official diplomatic historianu201D — and judges the volume under consideration,

predictably, as the work of a man perhaps overly interested in u201Cavoiding

serious criticism of the eminent officials he has known.u201D He comments

further:

One […] would

also like to believe that the sole motive of the eminent men he

knew was to save lives. It is not pleasant to think that they

were so fascinated by their new u201Cmaster cardu201D of diplomacy that

they scarcely considered the moral implications of their act when

they used it. That, however, is precisely what the evidence available

strongly suggests. [233]

Why

American History Is Not What They Say: An Introduction to

Revisionism

by Jeff Riggenbach

the author of In

Praise of Decadence, is a member of the Organization of American

Historians and a Senior Fellow of the Randolph Bourne Institute.

great minds behind the trample of Iraq are looking for the next

big diversion, and it could be the stomping of Syria. We can't waste

time thinking about where we have been, either 20 years ago or yesterday,

places like Kabul or Baghdad, such a mess, just not photogenic or

fun anymore. It's on to a new scene, the next eye-grabbing trailer.

It's all about entertainment anyway. The great minds are constantly

working for us the viewer, to keep us munching the popcorn and shushing

the guys sitting next to us so we can enjoy the movie.

From

the well-staged briefings in the new CENTCOM theater, to the excited

and on-the-team reporters, pleasantly rumpled and doe-eyed from

another night in bed with the troops, to the deck of cards we are

now shuffling with the Iraqi

55 most wanted, it's all about fun. Please pay no attention

to the ragged civilians or our tattered Constitution ailing in the

background.

Explaining

the recent hustle and hubris in today's U.S. foreign policy can

be difficult. We might look to chaos theory — popularly understood

as a butterfly flapping its wings in say…Washington, affecting in

unknown ways, say …the societal and governmental systems in the

Arab world. In an introduction to basic chaos theory, one would

probably review the four classes of dynamic systems. Class I behavior

converges on ""zero"" or death, Class II behavior leads

to history building upon itself, Class III is unpredictable randomness,

and Class IV is a mixture of the first two ""ordered"" classes

with Class III chaos such that behavior is ordered on the ""edge

of chaos."" Class IV systems are often seen as the natural state

of adaptive complex systems, whether biological or organizational.

Neocon

political thought — to the extent that it constitutes anything at

all beyond cleverly cloaked power-mad imperialism under neocon rule

— fancies itself to be actually applying some form of chaos theory.

The idea of the reverse domino effect (Iraq becomes a self-ruling

peaceful democracy in a single country, then the neighbors follow)

is a part of this mantra. Unfortunately, the neocons, not being

mathematicians or otherwise having any interest in bottom line truth,

have confused the idea of inflicting chaos with their delicate butterfly

wings in Washington with chaos theory as a mechanism of global development.

The

four classes of dynamic behavior are revealing.

Classes I and II are the ordered systems. Class I is governed by

a ""unifying principle or attractor"" or doomsday scenario.

Notable characteristics of the Class I include ""progressive

marginalization; contextually determined behaviour and absence of

choice; …traditional values (of ancestors) perceived as quaint and

of little current relevance. Possibly the black hole of individual

or collective self-righteousness."" Psychologically, Class I

is sometimes associated with the elderly, those near death, and

Class I dynamic systems are always terminal.

Class

II is the second order-based system, and it is associated with ""…established

patterns of order … Patterns of rights, obligations and constraints.

Top-down advocacy/imposition of behavioural guidelines…Organized

liberty. Emphasis on collective consensus. Time-tested cultural,

parental (family) values."" Class II is sometimes psychologically

associated with maturity and adulthood.

Class

III is seen in ""Chaotic behavioural patterns. Impermanence

of social structures. Unconstrained freedom of choice. Emphasis

on individualism. Postmodernist value relativism."" It is psychologically

linked with adolescence, youth and immaturity.

Class

IV is ""Emergent behavioural patterns of higher orders of complexity.

Surprise. Innovation. Higher orders of consensus. Grounding of new

values."" It is associated with ""social innovation and

the emergence of new patterns of relationship (partnerships, coalitions,

teams, groups, etc) but especially that which ensures renewal (including

reproduction).""

The

neocon worldview is sometimes proposed as Class IV style innovation,

with a risk-embracing strategy for changing the world, breaking

a few eggs to make one of Mr. Perle's soufflés, as it were.

Their strategy is to destroy the current state and society in the

Middle East, except for Israel, and in the new undergrowth, like

the scrub trees that replace the Ponderosa after a western forest

fire, they hope to find something they like.

An

interesting problem with Class I, II and III dynamic systems is

that in them, ""strategic

planning is not possible."" Chaotic new inputs are not systemically

recognized or incorporated by the ordered classes, and in the case

of Class III, order simply does not exist with true chaos. Now,

careful reading of the class descriptions might lead you to think

that the Class III adolescent approach is matched up with neoconservativism.

If you are very astute, you will notice that the Class I actually

more closely characterizes the neocon philosophy and practice.

This

brings us to the problem. Whether Class I or Class III, strategy

and strategic planning is impossible. Yet, we are assured that the

great minds are indeed implementing a strategy, and we must only

trust in it to be politically correct and live prosperously and

at peace. Given this insistence on the part of the neocon establishment,

we must conclude that, in fact, the neocons are laboring selflessly

for the rest of us under a false premise. They believe they are

working strategically towards a Class IV order that maximizes ""good""

chaos, but in fact are deliriously lost with one foot in a Class

III Rousseau-esque landscape of impermanence of social structures

and unconstrained freedom of choice, and the other in an open grave.

Well

— one thing should be clear. The label of ""paleo"" conservative

makes sense when coming from these intellectual juveniles with old

men's bodies. It must indeed appear to them that the classic liberal

viewpoints are passé, and that they, safe in their taxpayer-

or trust-funded and politically connected livelihoods, have discovered

an easy alternative to their ""parent's"" presumption that

improvements in the human condition are gained through hard work

and a gracious enduring appreciation for our fellow men and women

as brothers and sisters.

Thank

God these neo-cons are changelings, and do not spring from conservatism,

but instead are the ugly offspring of an abnormal and unsatisfying

mating of imperial ideologues Woodrow Wilson, Scoop Jackson and

Leon Trotsky.

Fortunately

for the rest of us, the neocon embrace of Class I and Class III

behavioral models guarantee the philosophy and its virulent carriers

a wild ride ending in certain death. The question is how much chaos

and collective self-righteousness can we all take before imperial

neo-conservativism totally disintegrates?

But

genealogy and complicated theories are so boring. We started out

looking for a diversion. While we wait to attack Syria, how about

a nice card game for the neocons? I am not completely sure of the

rules for the 55 cards in the ""let's go after the Iraqi regime

evil-doers"" game, so I can't recommend it. I understand poker

The purpose of this short article is to survey the discipline problem within the public school system keeping in mind the over-arching question of why students seem to no longer respect their teachers. At the end of the article, educators will find links to unorthodox advice to aid them in their discipline problems. Now, as a disclaimer, I would like to warn you that I loved a loud classroom when I taught at public schools. Anyone who observed my classroom would attest that it was anything but silent (or what other might label a disciplined classroom). Furthermore, I'm sure I allowed many actions that other teachers didn't; it's just not in my nature to like authority. Thus, I come to you as the glutton offering you great advice on how to lose weight.

What Are Books Telling Educators To Do?

A short trip to my local library gave me about a weekends worth of reading on classroom discipline. I won't lie; I wasn't impressed by any of them. Of the roughly 10 books I read, I maybe jotted down a page worth of helpful pros that I could have seen myself using in the classroom. In contrast, I filled numerous pages with disappointing, self-defeating things I would never use! Truthfully, outside our lacking, and completely arbitrary, state-mandated curriculum, advice for behavioral issues is probably among the most disappointing aspects of public education. A typical classroom discipline book reminds me of a corny, twenty-first generation politically correct, Leave it to Beaver episode. Wait, did I mention corny? Yes, it's true that we don't have, and don't need, administrators or educators paddling their students whenever they make mistakes, but we also don't need rooms full of adult sissies! Students rarely respect their teachers anymore, and to counteract this lack of respect, educators attempt to guilt their students into respecting them, or worse, attempt to define who is respectable and why they are one of them. When said strategies don't work, educators instead start pampering themselves with excuses that this is just the way students are today; they lack respect for anything. What a faulty excuse. Has anyone thought that maybe we should attempt to earn their respect? The point is that students' today lack respect for individuals who believe they can define success for them, as well as define whom they should deem to be failures. Such definitions of respect usually involve good grades, test scores, college, and knowledge of whatever subject the educator teaches. How self-serving! If a student asks me why they should have to be forced to study mathematics I don't proceed to wax on about my measly accomplishments and how important math is to colleges or employers. Even if there is merit in such verbiage, the merit is totally lacking to the students; it is simply too far removed from their life to have relevance (It’s like explaining the merits of retirement planning to a 21 year-old). Instead I take the uninterested criticism as a call to step up my lesson plans, to create better, more fun, ways for them to learn these math ideas. At the very least, if I can’t persuade them to see the relevance of math, I want them to look forward to coming to my math class. I mean, after all, their attendance is in some regards a product of force (force of the state, the parents, etc.); at least I could try to make their stay easier.

Thus, first and foremost, educators must purge themselves of this idea that, to the student, they are important. That their subject is important. That their measly accomplishments are important. That their previous learnings are important. That, in a truly free market, one where schools are held accountable for their results, their classroom would even remotely resemble the classroom-assembly-lines we have today. Only from here can we truly begin to network with a student's mind. Only from here can we create a system of mutual respect.

How do we do this? Well, our first task as educators is to take a second to get real. You and your students work about the same amount of hours per week, yet at the end of the month you receive a pay check and your students get squat! They are carted from their home, via a big yellow bus, where they are constantly told to be quiet and do work until the end of the day where they are carted back home, to which point in time they begin the process of working on the work you didn't have time to cover while they were in class. I can only imagine the advertisement for such a position.

The Chester County Middle School is proud to announce an opening for a full-time student beginning this fall with hours 8:00am-3:30pm Monday-Friday

Qualifications:

Must be willing to work 35 hours a week unpaid

Must be willing to meet deadlines

Must be willing to take work home

Must be willing to set quietly for an hour at a time

Must be responsible for learning the material presented

Must be willing to undergo tremendous pressure from peers

Must be willing to listen to daily pep talks about how their life will be ruined if they can't pass standardized tests

Finally, the job is not optional…you must attend!

I know what you're thinking and my response is sure, they are receiving an education that is valuable for their future, but let's remember that value is subjective. To the student, they are receiving little in exchange for their time. And to indulge the topic of value within the public school system, its role is questionable. Surely the public school system props up the bottom quartile of students, but it most likely pulls down the top quartile of students. Those near the middle are questionable. The fact of the matter is, the United States spends about $$123,000 per student for k-12 education. For that price we could build each kid a library at their house and offer them 24-hour tutoring from undergraduates. Therefore, before you go patting yourself on the back, you may want to question if you play any positive educational role at all in your students lives. What are you actually teaching them?

In other words, stop trying to scare them with stories of “when they get older” or “when they get to college”. Think of it this way, planning for retirement is thought by most to be good thing, investing a little per month over the course of many years will likely lead you to a lucrative retirement. Yet, it's hard for a 20 year old to understand this because to them, retirement is forever away. The same is true for the public school student. The adulthood stories that you keep calling upon to scare them are too far removed from their life to serve any purpose.

On Discipline

Just as parents of a toddler wish some portions of their parenting were easier (be it bedtime, bath time, or eating vegetables), all teachers wish some portion of their teaching were easier. Discipline is simply a function of your own embarrassment. I have a feeling that if classroom walls were soundproof the classrooms would be different in both volume and intensity. Simply put, kids are happier when they are louder and teachers are happier when their kids are happier; therefore, I imagine educators would allow their students to be louder if they weren't afraid of being caught and I imagine that such loudness wouldn't really disrupt learning like everyone supposes it would. When I'm teaching young students, I love a loud classroom! I would rather compete with other students for their attention than to compete with sleepiness or daydreaming. Being loud at least tells me they are awake! Many individuals are impressed by the fact that an educator can demand silence from their students for an hour by threatening, yelling, or scaring them; I am not. I think it is simply ridiculous!

In Closing

There is no panacea for classroom discipline; each day will bring new challenges. Kids who impress you will at some point in time embarrass you, just as those who usually embarrass you will sometimes impress you. Some of the research on the subject shows that many educators spend as much as 90 percent of their disciplinary attention on less than 10 percent of the class. To translate this, within any population there are entertainers and there are the entertained; clowns will be clowns! Yet, if we can begin on a level playing field of respect we surly have a better shot at creating a meaningful relationship and productive learning environment.

The Austrian School of economics, more than any other, is built on the idea of the centrality of entrepreneurship. Ludwig von Mises explained the principle profit and loss in terms of some forecasters’ ability to foresee consumer demand, and then plan to meet it at a total cost below the sales price. Successful entrepreneurs gain profit as a residual. Unsuccessful entrepreneurs gain losses.

According to Mises, the secret of making a profit is to foresee what your competitors do not see. This applies to every area of production. It surely applies to academic careers.

Gaining tenure — legal immunity from free market forces — is an exercise in niche-mining. It begins early. A Ph.D. candidate who has passed his written exams must then write a dissertation. The ideal dissertation topic is one that is so obscure that no one has paid any attention to it in at least twenty years — if ever — but which is sufficiently relevant to gain the acceptance of a dissertation committee. The topic should be so limited in scope that a candidate can crank out 200 pages in 18 months or fewer. Finally, his conclusions should match the overall views of his dissertation committee. Choosing this topic is an exercise in entrepreneurship.

A similar exercise begins — or should begin — at the end of an untenured assistant professor’s first year of teaching. In year one, he must demonstrate that he can lecture without signs of terror, that he shows up on time, and that he is able stay three pages ahead of his teaching assistant, if he has one.

At this point, he should decide on a career-launching topic. This topic should define his entire career. The more specialized, the better.

Israel Kirzner had one with his book, An Essay on Capital (1966), published by Augustus Kelley, which specializes in reprinting out of print books whose copyrights have lapsed. It sank without a trace. Then he switched gears. His Competition and Entrepreneurship (1973) made his reputation. It was published by the University of Chicago Press. Perceiving a profitable opportunity, he wrote Perception, Opportunity, and Profit (1979), also published by the University of Chicago Press. Then came The Meaning of Market Process (1992), published by Routledge, a British publisher. Then came The Driving Force of the Market (2000). In between were lots of articles on entrepreneurship.

Kirzner was one of four Ph.D. students produced by Mises. He was the only one whose career gained traction in academia. His career illustrates the career summary of the legendary Tammany Hall politician, George Washington Plunkitt: “I seen my opportunities, and I took ’em.” Go and do thou likewise.

CONTRARIANISM AND ACADEMIA

A tried and true method of gaining a hearing is to challenge a conventional view. But this must be done judiciously. This must not be a frontal assault on the prevailing view. To challenge the prevailing view early in your career is to secure for yourself a one-way ticket onto a community college faculty, probably part-time.

The Driving Force of t... Israel M Kirzner Best Price: $$17.61 Buy New $$47.02 (as of 07:05 EST - Details)

To begin challenging the prevailing view, focus on something obscure in the establishment’s outlook. Show how the prevailing view has ignored something or has produced an anomalous conclusion. This would make a good article for publication in a third-tier academic journal.

Repeat the process. Write another article, this time on an implication of your initial revision. Try to get into a second-tier journal.

Over time, you build up a portfolio of articles that undermine bits and pieces of the establishment’s view. This is guerilla warfare. Avoid a frontal assault. Hit and run.

Never lose sight of your ultimate goal: to become known as the scholar who undermined the prevailing view. But this reputation will come only after the prevailing view has been toppled by reality. Ideas have consequences, but only after reality have even greater consequences.

There were still academic Marxists who got a respectful hearing prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Academia respects power. In the social sciences, it respects power above all other criteria. As long as the USSR had power, academia gave Marxists a hearing. After August 21, 1991, academia turned on Marxists the way that jackals consume the remains of a gazelle killed by lions.

As with all things entrepreneurial, timing is crucial. Launch a frontal assault too early, and it’s community college time. Launch it too late, and you’re Dr. Me Too.

A FALSE GIANT SURROUNDED BY REAL PYGMIES

John Maynard Keynes is an academic giant in our era. He toppled his predecessors in the midst of enormous self-doubt in academic economic circles. The Great Depression seemed to refute the concept of the market-clearing process. Few free market economists focused on the underlying institutional problems of the depression. One was government-imposed price floors on wages and retail prices. Another was the implosion of fractional reserve banking. The market did not clear because it was not a free market.

Keynes spotted an opportunity after his Treatise on Money (1931) produced little impact academically. By 1931, the depression was undermining the academic establishment. He then wrote The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1936), which provided academic support for what all national governments were doing by 1931: running huge deficits.

His publisher, Macmillan, covered its bets. It published Lionel Robbins’ The Great Depression in 1934. Robbins offered a cogent free market explanation for the depression. Younger economists did not believe him. By the end of his life, even Robbins no longer believed him. He told Mark Skousen that the book had been a mistake. A year after Keynes’ General Theory, Macmillan published Banking and the Business Cycle, by Phillips, McManus, and Nelson, which was far better than Robbins’ book. (They are available on the Mises.org site: “Literature.”)

The Great Depression Lionel Robbins Best Price: $$24.90 Buy New $$30.00 (as of 08:50 EST - Details)

Keynes’ book caught on. Macmillan still sells it. This was highly successful entrepreneurship. It illustrates an investor’s rule: “Cut your losses, and let your profits run.”

Today, Keynesianism is having a revival. The economists have their fingers in the wind, as always, and the wind is blowing hurricane-force deficits. The economists have returned to Keynesianism like dogs to their vomit. While several hundred economists have publicly challenged the Keynesian policies of Obama’s Administration, they are generally not well-known and few of them teach in major research universities.

An entrepreneurially oriented young economist should see what is coming: mass inflation or depression or both, as Austrian business cycle theory teaches. Thus, he should begin positioning himself. He should devote his career to one topic: a line-by-line refutation of The General Theory.

MULTIMEDIA

A serious economist should not ignore any of the media.

Scholarly Journals. Focus on narrow topics. Play the math game, if possible. Show how certain minor implications of The General Theory have not worked out. Start with a less prestigious journal. Just get into print. Write a stream of these articles. If necessary, survey the history of academic debates over this narrow issue.

Monographs. A monograph published by a university press is always good for a career. Start with a topic where there are doubts about Keynes’ original insight. Survey these debates. Offer a conclusion: Keynes was wrong about something. Tie this to the market-clearing process if possible.

Teacher’s Guide. A guide saves time. Scholars want to save time. Nobody wants to read The General Theory after page 3. You should strive for clarity. Do what you can to make Keynes clear. Avoid offering refutations. This publication is for establishing your reputation as an expert on The General Theory.

Website #1. This site should be devoted to understanding The General Theory. Publish otherwise unpublishable shorter essays and notes on The General Theory. Break this site into categories. Cover the entire book. Take your time.

Glossary. Summarize his definitions. Support this with direct quotations from the book. Then contrast each definition with traditional definitions prior to 1936. Cite original sources. This can be part of your website. At some point, publish a book on this if a university press refuses. No one is sure what Keynes meant. If you can help economists figure this out, they will use your book or website.

Critical Essays. Begin writing critical essays. As you develop your portfolio of explanatory publications, which gain credibility, add to an unpublished reserve of essays on specific topics. Get them ready for publication five or more years out.

YouTube Channel. Create a channel on YouTube. Go through The General Theory concept by concept. Make this explanatory initially. These 8-minute videos direct viewers to your website.

Email List. Use Aweber.com to create a weekly or fortnightly email letter on Keynes. These should be mainly biographical — things that people will read because they are interesting. Keep them short: under 200 words. The letters remind readers that you are the expert in Keynes. Post older letters on your site in one category.

Website #2. This is devoted to dissecting The General Theory. Start this before your major critiques. Link to this site from your original site.

The Failure of the New... Henry Hazlitt Best Price: $$8.94 Buy New $$8.95 (as of 10:30 EST - Details)

Major Critique. This should be on the lines of Arthur Marget’s anti-Keynes Theory of Prices (1941), which never gained enough readers to be worth dropping down the memory hole later on. It should be as clear as Henry Hazlitt’s The Failure of the “New Economics” (1959). It had better be clearer than W. H. Hutt’s well-meaning but nearly unreadable books on Keynes. It should rely on Hutt’s Theory of Idle Resources (1939). Publish this ten years after your first publication in a scholarly journal. This book is your frontal assault. Don’t start with this book. Launch your career’s second phase with it. Devote your remaining years to a detailed refutation of every aspect of Keynes’ thought and career.

SUICIDE BOMBER

If you are in a community college and do not mind staying there, do your homework first. Master The General Theory. Publish anything that will help non-economists understand Keynes. Start positioning yourself as anti-Keynes.

Write a study guide for Hazlitt’s Failure. Master Marget’s book. Become an expert on what was wrong with Keynes. Then translate this into Hazlitt-style English.

This will probably cut off your career in scholarly journals. Murray Rothbard took this step no later than 1960.

If you are known as a hard-core opponent of Keynes, a university press will probably not publish your books. If your critique is openly based on Austrianism, forget about it.

Start including anti-Keynes insights into all of your work, from glossaries to monographs. Self-publish them as eBooks and as print-on-demand books. Use YouTube to gain followers among non-economists.

In short, write for non-economists. Take no academic prisoners. Make it clear that Keynesian economists are ideological, pro-State, tenured dolts.

This strategy is risky. It is what I would do. But I got out of academia in 1980, after one semester. I have never regretted that decision.

CONCLUSION

Understand in advance that you will change few minds until economic events force a reconsideration of Keynesianism. The economy must be so bad that Keynesians have no plausible solutions.

470115,"Every year I face the same question: what to get the kids for Christmas? My children are young adults now, so no longer do I get to try out all the new toys. Whenever I buy them clothes, they say, ""Well, Dad, now we are ready for any funeral or church function."" My taste tends to be pretty conservative.

So just like every other year, I am searching for that gift that will let them know how much I think of them. And now I have three grandchildren, so once again I get to look at that toy aisle. But this year I want something that will be very special.

These last couple years, I have been thinking a lot more about my children’s future. I always thought and hoped that I would be able to leave my children a country as free as my father left me. Now it looks like that won’t happen, and one of my great disappointments is how the mainstream press has become a tool for those elements in our society willing to give up freedom for some perceived safety.

Well, this year, I am going to do things a little differently. Oh, I am still going to pick out the somber clothes and will probably get everyone what I think is a fun gift. But this year I am also going to give a gift in my children’s and grandchildren’s name to LewRockwell.com.

Giving to this web site will actually do something for my children’s future. This site, LewRockwell.com as Burton Blumert writes, ""is the most important freedom site in the world,"" with a huge readership.

This site of Lew’s can entertain you, but also it can make you think, and think about many things in brand-new ways. LRC is not just for libertarians or conservatives, nor does age come in. My son and his sisters started reading, and now their friends are there too.

This Christmas, I will feel really good about this one gift. I know that Lew Rockwell makes a difference, and this gift is a positive step for my children, my grandchildren, and me too.

171039,"The heavy rains that pummeled California this year ended the state’s historic drought in spectacular fashion, saving the state’s farming and tourism industries from an uncertain future. But the return of rainfall has had other less obvious economic ramifications, including, as the Los Angeles Times reports, the revival of an activity that’s been associated with the state for more than 150 years: Prospecting for gold.

Thanks to the rain, the yellow metal is once again being found in the state’s riverbeds for the first time since a judge’s controversial ruling prohibited the use of pumps and other equipment that were once required to extract gold from the state’s rivers.

Instant Access to Current Spot Prices & Interactive Charts

Russ Tait

And now that word has spread, the possibility of discovering immense riches underfoot is inspiring entrepreneurial Californians of a variety of ages and backgrounds to venture to the state’s rivers and creeks in search of the shiny yellow metal, sometimes equipped with little more than a pan, as they hope to collect gold fragments buried in the muck under the water, according to the LAT.

Many have also taken to prospecting to suppliment their incomes, as wages in the US have stagnated and more than 90 million Americans aren’t working.

Russ Tait, an elderly man who spoke with the LAT, insists om venturing down to Eagle Creek in Central California – not far from where the Detwiler fire broke out in Northern Mariposa County.

“Tait has bone cancer, so getting down to the creek isn’t easy. But even if his days are numbered, he isn’t above dreaming. He peers into the murky solution, hoping to glimpse something shiny. “I guess you call it gold fever,” he says. “You get out there, and there’s times where you get tired and you don’t want to quit.”

Even in the middle of the drought, Tait, a longtime prospector, and several friends would venture down to the river looking for gold, only to return empty handed. The reason? Back in 2009, a state judge temporarily blocked prospectors from using motorized equipment near the state’s rivers after environmental groups complained that they could damage fish habitats. The ruling was meant to be temporary pending a study, but to this day, no final ruling has been made.

“The equipment was once necessary to separate gold from the slowing rivers. But now with water gushing forth from the state’s mountains, the motorized equipment isn’t needed. Now prospectors hunt for “irregularities” in rivers that could create “a backward eddy” that would allow the gold to drop to the water’s floor. Excessive ria severe flooding, and very nearly the failure of the Oroville dam in Northern California, has changed that. Geological gumshoes, they search for ancient rivers, for rounded boulders tumbled together, for orange soil tainted by rusted iron and veins of quartz hiding gold. They read streambeds, imagining how the current flowed during floods, hunting for any irregularity — a riffle, a ledge, a waterfall — that could create a backward eddy for the gold to escape the water’s momentum and drop to the floor.”

One prospector named Robert Guardiola helped organize an outing of nearly 40 miners to the Golden state’s “Mother Lode.” Guardiola and company are wearing waders and knee pads and equipped with pans and cradles.

“Late afternoon, after nearly an hour in the water, Guardiola totes two five-gallon buckets up from the creek. One contains trash collected from the shallows: a spark plug, a shotgun shell, a square-headed nail, a spatula and part of a car door. The other contains his concentrates, less than a cup of dark sand sloshing about in water. Panning it, he separates the lighter material from the heavier to reveal a few gold specks, each no bigger than a fat flea.”

As the LAT explains, the “Mother Lode,” which runs along the Sierra Nevada mountain range, was the epicenter of the 1848 gold rush, which saw $$2 billion in gold extracted from the area in less than five years. For Guardiola, prospecting has become a second career of sorts.

“Guardiola, 52, purchased the right to mine these 20 acres in 2001. When he first walked out on this property, he knew he could be happy here. Ten deer, two bucks and fawns browsed beneath the oaks. A stream — Grizzly Creek — cut through the property, which already had two mines on it, always a good sign. Seven years later, after losing his equipment rental store in Modesto to a broken plumbing pipe and a slow insurance claim, he began to work the claim more seriously. Prepped for the cold — insulated waders, booties, wool socks and sneakers — Guardiola wades into a pool of 55-degree water as deep as his thighs. “We’ll see if Mother Nature was kind and restocked my bank,” he says.

According to the LAT, the stream was dry during the worst days of the drought. Last year it became a trickle. Then this year, the winter brought a torrent of water as well as two feet of new rock and gravel deposits known in the profession as “overburden.”

For the amateur prospectors, the hobby has brought with it a kind of hope.

“As long as I’m not sure what’s in the bucket,” says Tom Mutschelknaus to the LAT, “there’s hope.”

Mutschelknaus prospects near the South Fork of Stanislaus River, a few miles from where one lucky miner pulled nearly 800 ounces out of the ground. Many prospectors have been following gold’s climb this year, excited that an amount that would almost fill a lipstick case is worth more than $$1,200.

While the LAT doesn’t touch on the parallels between the gold miners and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, often referred to as “digital gold,” Shannon Poe, 55, described prospecting in similar terms to the techno-libertarians who represent bitcoin’s most hardcore users.

“In his company, gold mining seems less a get-rich-quick scheme than a libertarian impulse, an exercise in independence and self-determination as much a part of the American heritage as the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Ask him what his political party is, and he’ll say he is neither a Republican nor a Democrat. “We are more constitutionalists than anything else,” he says.

With this framing in mind, the rush of amateur prospectors is hardly surprising. Since bitcoin first entered the public consciousness in 2013 thanks to stories of hobbyists becoming newly minted millionaires overnight, Americans everywhere are looking for the next easy score. In that respect, similar impulses appear to be behind both trends. But at least with prospecting, the only thing hobbyists are risking is their time.

469879,"I am by no means a financial expert and have lived most of my life from paycheck to paycheck, so the first thing I thought of when I read Patriots: A Novel of Survival in the Coming Collapse was ""Wow, those guys must have been rich to buy all that stuff!"" I was very overwhelmed and felt somewhat hopeless that I could ever have enough money to buy the things we needed to make it through TEOTWAWKI, especially now that the economy is worsening, and people have less and less money. So I set out to figure out what I would have to do to scrape together enough money to start preparing. I have compiled a few of the tips and tricks I have discovered over the last few years here, in hopes of sharing my knowledge so others can follow suit and become better prepared in these hard times.

A few notes here before we go on:

A. In this article I will refer to any ""extra"" or ""saved"" money as TEOTWAWKI Funds (or ""TF""). This is to be used for buying your preparedness supplies, not hoarded away in a bank account as useless cash.

B. There IS a difference between ""NEED"" and ""WANT."" Anything you buy requires three things; Money  not only for the purchase, but also for operation, maintenance, storage, licensing etc. Time  not only to find the item, but also for maintenance and repair. Space  to keep it in. Never buy on impulse. If you want something go home and think on it for a few days. Ask yourself: is this necessary? Who is it being purchased for? What will it be used for? When will it be used? Where will it be used and stored? Why is it needed? How can I pay for it? Most of the time when people sit down and think about it, a ""need"" actually isn’t a need  it is actually a ""want.""

With that being said, here are some of the things I have learned. No one thing is going to save you a ton of money, but added all up together can mean the difference of having money for your TF or not… Think and act as if you are poor and you will have more money in the end!

The Big Things:

1. Credit Cards  Do Not live off your credit cards! Do Not pay credit cards with other credit cards. Do Not pay recurring bills on credit cards. See a trend? Credit Cards should be used for emergencies only. Sell what you have to sell and do what you have to do to get them paid off to a zero dollar balance, then Do Not use them. If you can’t help yourself, take them out of your wallet and leave them at home. I can’t overemphasize this enough; too many people stretch themselves thin by living over their means and off their credit cards. That is not what they are meant for, and doesn’t do anything except get you further and further in debt.

2. Entertainment  Living in San Diego, I am in the epitome of wealth, status, and spending, so the first thing we will talk about here is entertainment. Do you really need those Pro Sports Jerseys, barbecues, flags, #1 fingers, helmets, cups, bottles, pens and all the other useless stuff they have? No you don’t. Put your money in your TF, and get your head out of the clouds. In fact, why not take up hiking or running, (which, incidentally, are free) and start training yourself for TEOTWAWKI. Buy yourself that expensive coffee every morning? Guess what, you don’t do it  brew your own at home and save a bundle! Spend money on toys? Do you really need an electric airplane? Gas-powered RC car? Boats? Quads? 50"" Flat-screen TV? $$5,000 stereo system? New china set? New furniture? I think not. Make do with what you have and save your money. What good is a high definition TV going to do for you when there is no food? Nothing. In fact, sell your big expensive items, downgrade, and use the extra money for your TF.

3. Cars and Appliances  Do you really need that new BMW you’ve been looking at? Ahem, no you don’t! If you have a vehicle that is paid off or close to it, it would be cheaper to keep that vehicle and fix it up than to buy a new one  even if you had to put a new engine in it! Better yet, if it’s financed, sell the vehicle you have  get out from under that loan  and go buy a used multi-purpose vehicle in cash. Even if you had to replace the whole drive-train in a used vehicle, it’s still cheaper than buying a brand new car! Also, while we’re on the topic of cars. Limit your driving and errand running; If you need a gallon of milk, don’t make an extra trip to the store  wait until you need to do your weekly grocery shopping. You will save so much money in gas alone just from cutting out useless running around. Limit your driving; write down where you go in one week’s time, and cut out or combine trips.

4. Electronics and Gadgets  people think they need things they actually don’t. Do you really need that new fridge, stove, washer, computer, cappuccino machine? CD, iPods, Blueray discs? I think not! As long as it works then keep it! If it stops working, learn how to fix it, and only then if it is too expensive to fix, sell it as used junk and buy another one, used. I see people all the time buy new appliance after new appliance needlessly, and it’s such a waste of money.

The Little Things:

1. Clothes  This is a big one for women, but also applies to men. Everyone already owns clothes. Look in your closet and arrange them to category. Work clothes. Play/ Relax clothes. Clothes for getting dirty. Clothes for going out. Do the same for shoes. You only need just a few per each category. That’s pretty much it. Sorry women, you don’t need 20 pairs of shoes and 15 purses. One works just fine. Get yourself a nice pair of sturdy boots and put the extra money in your TF. I haven’t bought new clothes in years. Take care of the ones you already have and you will be just fine  you can even alter them if they don’t fit or need adjusted for a very small fee. Again, cheaper than buying new ones. When you have to buy new clothes, buy ones that are on sale, functional, and easy to take care of. Sorry to say, you don’t really need a $$200 pair of jeans, or a $$500 cashmere jacket. Take the extra cash and buy TEOTWAWKI gear.

2. Food  This is an important one and not just for people new to survivalism. I have slowly learned how to cut our food bill  it does take some work, but it’s very possible. If you can cut your current food bill in half, then you could be using that other half to buy store away foods!

First  grow as much of your own food as possible! (Including animals; chickens and rabbits are cheap and easy to keep!) Even if you have a small yard, or no yard at all, buy some 5-to-15 gallon buckets and grow plants. You can set them up on your lawn, balcony, or even in your driveway if need be. You would be amazed at how much food you can get from pots. From just four big pots I got tomatoes all summer long, never had buy a single one. For whatever you can’t grow, buy your produce at the local vegetable stand or farmers market. Find the cheap ones. Either of these are usually much cheaper than the grocery market. Also, don’t buy expensive exotic fruits and veggies  you don’t need them.

Second  don’t buy name brand products. Most of the time the store-brand tastes exactly the same, and in many cases is even manufactured in the same plant!

The classical argument in favor of free immigration runs as follows: Other things being equal, businesses go to low-wage areas, and labor moves to high-wage areas, thus affecting a tendency toward the equalization of wage rates (for the same kind of labor) as well as the optimal localization of capital. An influx of migrants into a given-sized high-wage area will lower nominal wage rates. However, it will not lower real wage rates if the population is below its optimum size. To the contrary, if this is the case, the produced output will increase over-proportionally, and real incomes will actually rise. Thus, restrictions on immigration will harm the protected domestic workers qua consumers more than they gain qua producers. Moreover, immigration restrictions will increase the “flight” of capital abroad (the export of capital which otherwise might have stayed), still causing an equalization of wage rates (although somewhat more slowly), but leading to a less than optimal allocation of capital, thereby harming world living standards all-around.

In addition, traditionally labor unions, and nowadays environmentalists, are opposed to free immigration, and this should prima facie count as another argument in favor of a policy of free immigration.

II

It would also be wrongheaded to attack the above case for free immigration by pointing out that because of the existence of a welfare state, immigration has become to a significant extent the immigration of welfare-bums, who, even if the United States, for instance, is below her optimal population point, do not increase but rather decrease average living standards. For this is not an argument against immigration but against the welfare state. To be sure, the welfare state should be destroyed, root and branch. However, in any case the problems of immigration and welfare are analytically distinct problems, and they must be treated accordingly.

The problem with the above argument is that it suffers from two interrelated shortcomings which invalidate its unconditional pro-immigration conclusion and/or which render the argument applicable only to a highly unrealistic — long bygone — situation in human history.

The first shortcoming will only be touched upon. To libertarians of the Austrian school, it should be clear that what constitutes “wealth” and “well-being” is subjective. Material wealth is not the only thing that counts. Thus, even if real incomes rise due to immigration, it does not follow that immigration must be considered “good,” for one might prefer lower living standards and a greater distance to other people over higher living standards and a smaller distance to others.

Instead, a second, related shortcoming will be the focus here. With regard to a given territory into which people immigrate, it is left unanalyzed who, if anyone, owns (controls) this territory. In fact, in order to render the above argument applicable, it is — implicitly — assumed that the territory in question is unowned, and that the immigrants enter virgin territory (open frontier). Obviously, this can no longer be assumed. If this assumption is dropped, however, the problem of immigration takes on an entirely new meaning and requires fundamental rethinking.

III

All land is privately owned, including all streets, rivers, airports, harbors, etc. With respect to some pieces of land, the property title may be unrestricted; that is, the owner is permitted to do with his property whatever he pleases as long as he does not physically damage the property owned by others. With respect to other territories, the property title may be more or less severely restricted. As is currently the case in some housing developments, the owner may be bound by contractual limitations on what he can do with his property (voluntary zoning), which might include residential vs. commercial use, no buildings more than four stories high, no sale or rent to Jews, Germans, Catholics, homosexuals, Haitians, families with or without children, or smokers, for example.

Clearly, under this scenario there exists no such thing as freedom of immigration. Rather, there exists the freedom of many independent private property owners to admit or exclude others from their own property in accordance with their own unrestricted or restricted property titles. Admission to some territories might be easy, while to others it might be nearly impossible. In any case, however, admission to the property of the admitting person does not imply a “freedom to move around,” unless other property owners consent to such movements. There will be as much immigration or non-immigration, inclusivity or exclusivity, desegregation or segregagtion, non-discrimination or discrimination based on racial, ethnic, linguistic, religious, cultural or whatever other grounds as individual owners or associations of individual owners allow.

Note that none of this, not even the most exclusive form of segregationism, has anything to do with a rejection of free trade and the adoption of protectionism. From the fact that one does not want to associate with or live in the neighborhood of Blacks, Turks, Catholics or Hindus, etc., it does not follow that one does not want to trade with them from a distance. To the contrary, it is precisely the absolute voluntariness of human association and separation — the absence of any form of forced integration — that makes peaceful relationships — free trade — between culturally, racially, ethnically, or religiously distinct people possible.

IV

everyone residing outside of this territory becomes a foreigner. State borders (and passports) are an “unnatural” (coercive) institution. Indeed, their existence (and that of a domestic government) implies a two-fold distortion with respect to peoples’ natural inclination to associate with others. First, inlanders cannot exclude the government (the taxman) from their own property, but are subject to what one might call “forced integration” by government agents. Second, in order to be able to intrude on its subjects’ private property so as to tax them, a government must invariably take control of existing roads, and it will employ its tax revenue to produce even more roads to gain even better access to all private property, as a potential tax source. Thus, this over-production of roads does not involve merely an innocent facilitation of interregional trade — a lowering of transaction costs — as starry-eyed economists would have us believe, but it involves forced domestic integration (artificial desegregation of separate localities).

Moreover, with the establishment of a government and state borders, immigration takes on an entirely new meaning. Immigration becomes immigration by foreigners across state borders, and the decision as to whether or not a person should be admitted no longer rests with private property owners or associations of such owners but with the government as the ultimate sovereign of all domestic residents and the ultimate super-owner of all their properties. Now, if the government excludes a person while even one domestic resident wants to admit this very person onto his property, the result is forced exclusion (a phenomenon that does not exist under private property anarchism). Furthermore, if the government admits a person while there is not even one domestic resident who wants to have this person on his property, the result is forced integration (also non-existent under private property anarchism).

V

Traditional monarchies — and kings — are the closest historical examples of this form of government.

What will a king’s typical immigration and emigration policy be? Because he owns the entire country’s capital value, he will, assuming no more than his self-interest, tend to choose migration policies that preserve or enhance rather than diminish the value of his kingdom.

As far as emigration is concerned, a king will want to prevent the emigration of productive subjects, in particular of his best and most productive subjects, because losing them would lower the value of the kingdom. Thus, for example, from 1782 until 1824 a law prohibited the emigration of skilled workmen from Britain. On the other hand, a king will want to expel his non-productive and destructive subjects (criminals, bums, beggars, gypsies, vagabonds, etc.), for their removal from his territory would increase the value of his realm. For this reason Britain expeled tens of thousands of common criminals to North America and Australia.

On the other hand, as far as immigration policy is concerned, a king would want to keep the mob, as well as all people of inferior productive capabilities, out. People of the latter category would only be admitted temporarily, if at all, as seasonal workers without citizenship, and they would be barred from permanent property ownership. Thus, for example, after 1880 large numbers of Poles were hired as seasonal workers in Germany. A king would only permit the permanent immigration of superior or at least above-average people; i.e., those whose residence in his kingdom would increase his own property value. Thus, for example, after 1685 (with the revocation of the Edict of Nantes) tens of thousands of Huguenots were permitted to settle in Prussia; and similarly Peter the Great, Frederick the Great, and Maria Theresia later promoted the immigration and settlement of large numbers of Germans in Russia, Prussia, and the eastern provinces of Austria-Hungary.

In brief, while through his immigration policies a king might not entirely avoid all cases of forced exclusion or forced integration, such policies would by and large do the same as what private property owners would do, if they could decide who to admit and who to exclude. That is, the king would be highly selective and very much concerned about improving the quality of the resident human capital so as to drive property values up, not down.

VI

Migration policies become predictably different, once the government is publicly owned. The ruler no longer owns the country’s capital value, but only has current use of it. He cannot sell or bequeath his position as ruler; he is merely a temporary caretaker. Moreover, “free entry” into the position of a caretaker government exists. Anyone can, in principle, become the ruler of the country.

Democracies as they came into existence on a world-wide scale after World War I offer historical examples of public government.

What are a democracy’s migration policies? Once again assuming no more than self-interest (maximizing monetary and psychic income: money and power), democratic rulers tend to maximize current income, which they can appropriate privately, at the expense of capital values, which they cannot appropriate privately. Hence, in accordance with democracy’s inherent egalitarianism of one-man-one-vote, they tend to pursue a distinctly egalitarian — non-discriminatory — emigration and immigration policy.

As far as emigration policy is concerned, this implies that for a democratic ruler it makes little, if any, difference whether productive or unproductive people, geniuses or bums leave the country. They have all one equal vote. In fact, democratic rulers might well be more concerned about the loss of a bum than that of a productive genius. While the loss of the latter would obviously lower the capital value of the country and loss of the former might actually increase it, a democratic ruler does not own the country. In the short run, which most interests a democratic ruler, the bum, voting most likely in favor of egalitarian measures, might be more valuable than the productive genius who, as egalitarianism’s prime victim, will more likely vote against the democratic ruler. For the same reason, a democratic ruler, quite unlike a king, undertakes little to actively expel those people whose presence within the country constitutes a negative externality (human trash, which drives individual property values down). In fact, such negative externalities — unproductive parasites, bums, and criminals — are likely to be his most reliable supporters.

As far as immigration policies are concerned, the incentives and disincentives are likewise distorted, and the results are equally perverse. For a democratic ruler, it also matters little whether bums or geniuses, below or above-average civilized and productive people immigrate into the country. Nor is he much concerned about the distinction between temporary workers (owners of work permits) and permanent, property owning immigrants (naturalized citizens). In fact, bums and unproductive people may well be preferable as residents and citizens, because they cause more so-called “social” problem,” and democratic rulers thrive on the existence of such problems. Moreover, bums and inferior people will likely support his egalitarian policies, whereas geniuses and superior people will not. The result of this policy of non-discrimination is forced integration: the forcing of masses of inferior immigrants onto domestic property owners who, if they could have decided for themselves, would have sharply discriminated and chosen very different neighbors for themselves. Thus, the United States immigration laws of 1965, as the best available example of democracy at work, eliminated all formerly existing “quality” concerns and the explicit preference for European immigrants and replaced it with a policy of almost complete non-discrimination (multi-culturalism).

Indeed, though rarely noticed, the immigration policy of a democracy is the mirror image of its policy toward internal population movements: toward the voluntary association and dissociation, segregation and desegregation, and the physical distancing and approximating of various private property owners. Like a king, a democratic ruler will promote spatial over-integration by over-producing the “public good” of roads. However, for a democratic ruler, unlike a king, it will not be sufficient that everyone can move next door to anyone else on government roads. Concerned about his current income and power rather than capital values and constrained by egalitarian sentiments, a democratic ruler will tend to go even further. Through non-discrimination laws — one cannot discriminate against Germans, Jews, Blacks, Catholics, Hindus, homosexuals, etc. — the government will want to open even the physical access and entrance to everyone’s property to everyone else. Thus, it is hardly surprising that the so-called “Civil Rights” legislation in the United States, which outlawed domestic discrimination on the basis of color, race, national origin, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, etc., and which thereby actually mandated forced integration, coincided with the adoption of a non-discriminatory immigration policy; i.e., mandated inter-national desegregation (forced integration).

VII

The current situation in the United States and in Western Europe has nothing whatsoever to do with “free” immigration. It is forced integration, plain and simple, and forced integration is the predictable outcome of democratic — one-man-one-vote — rule. Abolishing forced integration requires a de-democratization of society, and ultimately the abolition of democracy. More specifically, the authority to admit or exclude should be stripped from the hands of the central government and re-assigned to the states, provinces, cities, towns, villages, residential districts, and ultimately to private property owners and their voluntary associations. The means to achieve this goal are decentralization and secession (both inherently un-democratic, and un-majoritarian). One would be well on the way toward a restoration of the freedom of association and exclusion as it is implied in the idea and institution of private property, and much of the social strife currently caused by forced integration would disappear, if only towns and villages could and would do what they did as a matter of course until well into the nineteenth century in Europe and the United States: to post signs regarding entrance requirements to the town, and once in town for entering specific pieces of property (no beggars or bums or homeless, but also no Moslems, Hindus, Jews, Catholics, etc.); to kick out those who do not fulfill these requirements as trespassers; and to solve the “naturalization” question somewhat along the Swiss model, where local assemblies, not the central government, determine who can and who cannot become a Swiss citizen.

What should one hope for and advocate as the relatively correct immigration policy, however, as long as the democratic central state is still in place and successfully arrogates the power to determine a uniform national immigration policy? The best one may hope for, even if it goes against the “nature” of a democracy and thus is not very likely to happen, is that the democratic rulers act as if they were the personal owners of the country and as if they had to decide who to include and who to exclude from their own personal property (into their very own houses). This means following a policy of utmost discrimination: of strict discrimination in favor of the human qualities of skill, character, and cultural compatibility.

More specifically, it means distinguishing strictly between “citizens” (naturalized immigrants) and “resident aliens” and excluding the latter from all welfare entitlements. It means requiring as necessary, for resident alien status as well as for citizenship, the personal sponsorship by a resident citizen and his assumption of liability for all property damage caused by the immigrant. It implies requiring an existing employment contract with a resident citizen; moreover, for both categories but especially that of citizenship, it implies that all immigrants must demonstrate through tests not only (English) language proficiency, but all-around superior (above-average) intellectual performance and character structure as well as a compatible system of values — with the predictable result of a systematic pro-European immigration bias.

740897,"In debates over the fate of the U.S. dollar there appears to be a need for clarification.

While since last spring the dollar has declined about 15% in value compared to a basket of other major currencies, on the domestic front a dollar today buys about 30% more common stock than it did two years ago at the peak, and the dollar also rose substantially in value vs. real estate during the same period.

This distinction is critical because for most people the value of the dollar in terms of foreign currencies is probably not a day-to-day concern. Any change the dollar’s purchasing power in terms of domestic assets, however, is very important both now and when planning for the future.

Tens of trillions of dollars of credit-from-nowhere now in existence fuel demand for goods and services, bidding up asset prices across the entire world economy. This mountain of credit was built on three pillars.

Fractional reserve banking. Government debt issuance. Packaging of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) into ""securities.""

The third pillar, CDOs, required a phenomenal collective delusion for sustenance, and that level of delusion is gone. It comes around once every several centuries, so we probably shouldn’t hold our breath awaiting its return.

The banking pillar is full of cracks as the banks’ overreliance on real estate loans is increasingly recognized. With their weakness revealed, banks cannot offset credit destruction due to collapsing mortgages and multiplying loan defaults.

Amazingly, the pillar of government debt issuance remains the strongest. This revolving door of taxes paid, massive borrowing, and government payments (direct and indirect) to nearly every citizen is now the sole whirlwind supporting the greatest faux economy since John Law’s Mississippi Scheme or the South Sea Bubble. Whereas it required all three pillars to leverage the growth of credit to these dizzying heights, only one remains to hold the forces of credit collapse deflation at bay.

So what is a prudent person to do to preserve capital in our chaotic times? No one knows for sure.

If one believes that the failure of the Federal Debt system is imminent, then one should be preparing for TEOTWAWKI. In this event, prudent preparation includes quitting the job, selling the house, moving the family to a temperate rural area and converting all assets to guns, food, ammo, farmland, livestock, barter goods, and books on how to live an 18th century lifestyle.

The trouble is that preparing for TEOTWAWKI renders one in a very poor position should things not be quite so catastrophic. People are incredibly resourceful and the history of communism shows us that even unsustainable systems don’t necessarily collapse all at once.

If the federal government system survives for a period of time after the Federal Reserve banking cartel crashes (or more likely, is seized by an Act of Congress), instead of an immediate dollar collapse, surviving dollars would soar in value. Ironically, the closer any dollar credit exists to the U.S. Treasury, the longer it may survive. The idea in this case would be to hold the last surviving dollar credits, stepping off that boat to the dry land of hard assets when all vulnerable credits have disappeared and asset values have declined about as far as they’re going to. Then will be the time to flee dollars in fear of the appearance of ever-larger denominations of currency, the hallmark of currency hyperinflation.

Can people lose faith in the banking system but maintain trust in Uncle Sam (and the legal tender illusion) for a time, despite the unsustainable binge of central government borrowing and certain train wreck of entitlement programs? To me the answer is yes, they can.

No one knows the future, but a resumption of the domestic surge in the value of the dollar (attended by price declines for stocks, real estate, and other assets) is among the possibilities, and each person must decide which among those paths to prepare for.

372154,"By Dr. Mercola

Thyroid disease is one of the most common health problems we face today. From a practical standpoint, there are many ways to approach this issue. In this interview, Dr. Jonathan Wright, a pioneer in natural medicine, shares his protocols for addressing thyroid dysfunction.

Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, is a very common problem, and there are many reasons for this, including drinking chlorinated and fluoridated water, and eating brominated flour.

Chlorine, fluoride, and bromine are all in the same family as iodine, and can displace iodine in your thyroid gland.

Secondly, many people simply aren’t getting enough iodine in their diet to begin with. The amount you get from iodized salt is just barely enough to prevent you from getting a goiter.

A third principal cause of hypothyroidism is related to elevated reverse T3 levels. Interestingly, 95 percent of the time, those with elevated reverse T3 levels will see their levels revert back to normal after undergoing chelation with EDTA and DMPS, which draw out cadmium, lead, mercury, and other toxic metals. In essence, heavy metal toxicity can cause a functional form of hypothyroidism.

“It’s very well-known that lead and cadmium interfere with testosterone production,” Dr. Wright says. “What’s not so well-known is that reverse T3 is stimulated by toxic metals, so up it goes. In effect, we can have levels that are so high, they way outnumber the regular T3. You’re functionally hypothyroid even if your TSHs and free T3s happen to be normal.”

In Japan, the daily dose of iodine obtained from the diet averages around 2,000 to 3,000 micrograms (mcg) or 2-3 milligrams (mg), and there’s reason to believe this may be a far more adequate amount than the US recommended daily allowance (RDA) of 150 mcg.

Some argue for even higher amounts than that, such as Dr. Brownstein, who recommends 12.5 milligrams (mg) on a regular basis. Another proponent of higher iodine amounts is Guy Abraham, an ob-gyn and endocrinologist at the University of Southern California.

“Oddly enough, he didn’t publicize [his publications] much until he retired from the University of Southern California. But after that, he came out with a wonderful website, optimox.com, where you can read a lot of stuff for free,”Dr. Wright says. “There’s a fairly careful study showing that the thyroid gland does not start to downregulate until we get to 14 or 14.5 milligrams of total iodine and iodide. This is probably why Dr. Abraham first, and then others, have designed both liquids and tablets that come out with 12 or 12.5 mg. Oddly enough, in 1829, Dr. Lugol put together a combination of iodine and iodide. Two drops of that stuff equals exactly to 12.5 milligrams. How did Dr. Lugol know? We don’t know. But it works so well for people ever since 1829 that it’s still available (with a prescription) as Lugol’s iodine… Usually, in my practice, I’ll say, ‘One drop of Lugol’s, which is six milligrams; six and a quarter.’ Or for the guys, who don’t have as much massive breast tissue, let’s stay with three milligrams. [To] prevent cancer, I want more than three milligrams for the ladies.”

From Dr. Wright’s experience, there are no adverse effects from taking upwards of 12.5 mg of iodine per day, and in some cases higher amounts may benefit more than your thyroid. There’s compelling research suggesting that iodine is equally important for breast health, and that iodine – not iodide – combines with a lipid to form molecules that actually kill breast cancer cells.

“Breasts are big sponges for iodine,” Dr. Wright notes. “Not iodide so much; that’s the thyroid gland. But if you have enough iodine, why, those molecules are just sitting there ready waiting to kill new breast cancer cells!”

According to Dr. Wright, iodine is also crucial for other breast-related problems, such as fibrocystic breast disease, for which iodine works nearly every time. Interestingly, for severe cases, it’s recommended to swab the entire cervix with iodine.

“For bad cases, you got to work with your doctor. Get the iodine swab done,”Dr. Wright says. “The worse the fibrocystic breast disease is, the more treatment it takes. But that one, I can almost give a money-back guarantee… because I never would have to give you your money back.”

That said, it would seem prudent for most to avoid taking such high doses unless they were using it therapeutically, for a short period of time. I personally feel that supplementation at a dose 10 times lower, or a few mg, might be best for most.

Good Sources of Iodine

Another concern is the potential radiation issue from the Fukushima reactor, which has contaminated much of the Japanese seaweed. So make sure you look at the source of your seaweed. Try to get it from the Norwegian Coast or as far away from Japan as you can get. While manufacturers have not started labeling their products as “radiation-free,” you could simply check the bottle with a Geiger counter before taking it.

Dr. Wright’s Thyroid Program

Dr. Wright always begins with a physical exam, where he looks for signs of thyroid dysfunction. This includes symptoms such as dry skin, thinning of the outer margins of your eyebrows, subtle accumulation of fluid in your ankles, constipation, lack of sweating, weight gain, and high cholesterol. An older yet helpful test is to take your temperature every morning and observing if your temperature registers close to 98.6.

This test stems from the work of Dr. Broda Barnes back in the ’30s and ’40s. Dr. Barnes found that if the temperature was low, it was a reliable indication of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroid). “These days, with all the other things going on, I find that sign useful in some people but not in others,” Dr. Wright says. “But I do want it for everybody.”

As for laboratory tests, the complete thyroid panel includes thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), total T4, free T4, total T3, free T3, and the reverse T3. He cautions against trusting the TSH test as a primary diagnostic tool, despite that being the conventional norm. He bases his recommendation on research by Dr. St. John O’Reilly, an expert on thyroid health at the University of Scotland, who has shown that the TSH test virtually never correlates with the clinical condition of the patient.

“The Free T3 is, of course, the free hormone, not the one bound up on the thyroid globulin, where it’s temporarily inactive,” Dr. Wright explains. “The Free T3 is the one that helps us to burn energy; it’s the active hormone. The Free T4 is waiting to become active, but it’s not active yet. It signals back to the TSH. But the Free T3 doesn’t signal back to the TSH as much as the Free T4 does.”

Meanwhile, the T4 is the type of thyroid replacement that is typically and traditionally given by almost every conventional physician. In my experience, it’s one of the primary ways you can differentiate between a natural medicine physician and a traditional conventional physician: the type of thyroid replacement they prescribe.

Complicating Matters: Autoimmune Thyroid

Unfortunately, most people who end up on thyroid hormone replacement are placed on synthetic thyroid hormone, again, typically T4, commonly prescribed under the brand names Synthroid or Levothroid. Traditional doctors almost always prescribe this, and anyone who doesn’t prescribe it is oftentimes severely criticized, and may even be called before their state medical board.

That actually happened to me, and I wasn’t even prescribing it. I have stopped seeing patients, but have written about it in this newsletter. I was called before the medical board to defend my position on prescribing bioidentical whole thyroid hormone rather than Synthroid or Levothroid—even though my article was supported by a study reference from the New England Journal of Medicine, a very prestigious journal. Dr. Wright also prefers bioidentical thyroid replacement, and typically starts patients out on whole thyroid derived from animals (typically cow, sheep, or pig).

“In the whole thyroid are all the things that nature and creation put into whole thyroid. That’s what we should be using unless you happen to have an autoimmune problem. Many people with… Hashimoto’s disease… make antibodies to thyroid. If you’re making antibodies to thyroid, I’m not sure that we should be putting in whole thyroid right away… because there is a small chance – it’s not a large chance – that we’re going to stimulate more antibody formation,” he says.

gland makes, and which are all found in whole thyroid.

The Role of Heavy Metal Toxicity

As mentioned at the beginning, one of the principal causes of hypothyroidism is related to elevated reverse T3 levels, which can become elevated in response to heavy metal toxicity. In such cases, Dr. Wright recommends detoxifying before beginning thyroid treatment. The detoxification protocol will vary depending on your level of lead, cadmium, mercury, and other heavy metals.

“Some people get these efficiently out of their bodies within 10 to 15 chelation treatments. There are other people, particularly those who lived in major metropolitan areas all their lives, where it takes 30 or 40 chelation treatments to pull out all the toxic metals,” he notes. “When doing that, you have to make sure you’re seeing a doctor who follows the procedure put out by the American Board of Chelation Therapy (ABCT). Chelation pulls out toxic minerals. But no one has yet discovered a chelation material that pulls out toxic metals without pulling out normal metals, too – calcium, magnesium, zinc, and copper, the whole works. The doctors doing the chelation must be reinfusing normal minerals periodically according to his or her reading of the initial chelation test. The initial chelation test on page one shows all the toxic metals that are or not coming out. Page two, which should never be omitted, should always be done. It shows the normal minerals.”

In the meantime, while you’re trying to clear these toxic metal stores to bring the reverse T3 down, opinions are mixed on whether you should be treated with thyroid medication or not. Some believe it’s beneficial to add in regular T3, but if the chelation rectifies your reverse T3 level, then by adding regular T3, you may simply end up with too much free T3. Others recommend waiting until the chelation is done to reevaluate, and if needed, put you on whole thyroid later on, provided you don’t have a family history of autoimmune disease or have Hashimoto’s.

“It simply takes the doctor’s judgment and skill in deciding which way to go,” Dr. Wright says.

Clearly, this is a process you’re not going to be able to do by yourself. You really need to have a health coach, a trusted and respected healthcare clinician, who has the capacity to perform these relevant tests and procedures, who can also prescribe the appropriate supplements and thyroid hormone replacement, which you cannot obtain over the counter.

Elimination of carbon-based toxins, such as herbicides and pesticides, can be promoted through sauna-induced sweating. TheHubbard Protocol takes it a step further, and involves the use of niacin, high-intensity exercises, and sauna on a regular basis to help mobilize and eliminate toxins. Unfortunately, sweating doesn’t readily eliminate toxic metals. For those, you need a more aggressive approach, such as chelation.

One option that can help minimize the loss of crucial microminerals is to use chelating suppositories. They will still pull out minerals from your system, but you don’t have to worry about it nullifying the nutritional value of the food you just ate, which is a concern anytime you take an oral chelating agent. One drawback is that it takes a bit longer. “I’ve seen some people who have to do rectal suppository stuff for a couple of years to get all their toxic metals out,” he says. “And yes, we check their normal minerals fairly routinely, every couple of months, just to make sure it’s not being overdone that way.”

Recommended Types of Thyroid Medications

Once your reverse T3 is normalized and any autoimmune issues have been addressed, Dr. Wright goes on to prescribe a thyroid hormone replacement, such as:

Armour thyroid

Nature-Throid

Westhroid

The Armour Thyroid has one disadvantage: despite it being practically a generic now, it costs twice as much as the other two. But unless cost is a major factor, there are several types of tests to check for compatibility, to determine which one is likely to work the best for you.

“We’ve all heard of muscle testing. We don’t have to employ that, but some doctors are very skilled at it,” Dr. Wright says. “We use other sorts of compatibility testing to check for energy flow in the acupuncture meridians and how it’s impaired or not impaired by certain types of thyroid. We’ll go with the one that’s compatible with that individual. But we do respect if people say, ‘Look, I’ve heard that Westhroid and Nature-Throid are half the price of Armour Thyroid. Let’s stick with those if we can.’ We do respect that.”

As for fine-tuning the dose, there are a wide variety of symptoms that can help you gauge whether you’re getting enough of a dose—or help you determine whether you might have a thyroid problem to begin with. To learn more, Dr. Wright suggests picking up Dr. David Brownstein’s book Overcoming Thyroid, Dr. Mark Starr’s book Hypothyroidism Type 2: The Epidemic, or Dr. Ridha Arem’s book The Thyroid Solution. All of these books contain checklists of symptoms to look out for.

If you’re on thyroid hormone replacement, two key signals that you’re taking too much are excessive sweating and rapid heartbeat or heart palpitations. If you get either of those symptoms, you’re getting too much thyroid, and you need to cut back on the dose.

It’s also worth noting that in some cases, if you’re borderline hypothyroid, you may only need an iodine supplement rather than a thyroid hormone replacement. “Some people ask that very question. They’re close enough to normal and they say, ‘I could feel a little better. My test could be a little better. But can I just try some iodine?’ They try and sometimes it succeeds. That’s another option. Sometimes you could normalize with nothing more.”

Treating Overactive Thyroid

At the other end of the spectrum of thyroid dysfunction, you have hyperthyroidism, where your thyroid is overactive. It’s far less common than hypothyroidism, but it’s no less of a problem when it happens. “It’s not common. No. But we should let everybody know that there is an effective treatment out there,” Dr. Wright says. This is particularly important in light of the conventional treatment options, which are really poor. Typically, you’re looking at using radioactive iodine, which is a disaster, or surgery.

In the video clip above Dr Wright reviews the treatment that originated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC), at their department of thyroid. They had enough people with hyperthyroidism there that they were able to divide them into four treatment groups. One treatment group received lithium. A second group received Lugol’s iodine. Group three took lithium first and then, three or four days later, started iodine. Group four took Lugol’s iodine first, and then three or four days later started taking lithium.

When the statistical dust settled, what they found was that the group that started with Lugol’s iodine and finished with lithium did significantly better than all of the other groups in getting the hyperthyroidism under rapid control. More than two decades ago, The Mayo Clinic also published an article on the treatment of hyperthyroidism using lithium. Here, they used lithium alone, and were also able to bring abnormally high T3 and T4 numbers down to normal within a week to 10 days. It didn’t work on everybody though.

According to Dr. Wright, Walter Reed’s system is profoundly effective. Of all the people treated for hyperthyroidism in Dr. Wright’s clinic, amounting to about 40, there have only been two cases where the protocol failed. Normal levels can often be achieved in less than two weeks. In summary, the treatment is as follows:

Patient starts out on five drops of Lugol’s iodine, three times per day

After four or five days, patient starts receiving 300 mg of lithium carbonate, one to three times per day

Take Control of Your Thyroid Health

Hypothyroidism is far more prevalent than once thought. Some experts believe that anywhere between 10 and 40 percent of Americans have suboptimal thyroid function. Thyroid hormones are used by every cell of your body to regulate metabolism and body weight by controlling the burning of fat for energy and heat. They’re also required for optimal brain function and development in children. If you feel sluggish and tired, have difficulty losing weight, have dry skin, hair loss, constipation, cold sensitivity, and/or lack of sweating, these could be signs of hypothyroidism.

Iodine is the key to a healthy thyroid, and if you’re not getting enough from your diet (in the form of seafood), you’d be well advised to consider taking a supplement, ideally a high-quality seaweed supplement (be sure to check its source to avoid potential radioactive contamination), or other iodine-containing whole food supplement.

DIGG THIS

Modern industrialized countries — those who have historically enjoyed lower levels of state interventionism — are awash in goods and services that previous generations could have only dreamed of. From dozens of vehicle manufacturers and thousands of musicians to the myriad of restaurants in modern cities and uncountable brands of food and produce that we can chose from — all this is the result of a market economy and the triumph of the entrepreneur. The healthy desire to peacefully profit by satisfying the needs of others, and the (legal) ability to do this, is what differentiates a prosperous nation from one which is not.

A simple walk or drive along the main roads of major cities around the world would overwhelm even the greatest of kings from the past: everywhere we look there is a business. The sheer abundance of supermarkets, hotels, repair shops, jewelers, concert halls, theaters, bars and pubs shows that human needs are virtually unlimited and that efficiency and a competitive spirit benefit us all.

Enemies of choice

But there are those who shy away from progress, who despise modernity and who utterly hate that modern life has become “decadent” or that contemporary society is bathing in intellectual filth. They claim that, for example, the music that most people listen to is, well, crappy. And the same goes for their entertainment choices (mind-numbing television and films devoid of intellectual value, or so it goes).

Let’s stop to think about this. Before the time where nations had open and widespread market economies, only the very rich — perhaps an aristocrat — was able to enjoy music or specialty foods. Only they had the time and the resources necessary (often collected by taxation) to live in sumptuous ways. Everyone else, on the other hand had no way to enjoy the luxuries of the high class.

Today, the average person in the U.S. specifically, and in western societies generally, has access to hundreds of TV channels, grocery stores that sell goods from all over the world, and the possibility to easily purchase music by literally pressing a few buttons on a keyboard. And while the amount of goods and services has increased, so has the range of quality. It would be myopic to think that a growing market would only cater to a specific group of people and to their exclusive taste. Unlike kings or queens, most people today would not enjoy having a Beethoven or a Mozart personally come to their home to debut their latest string quartet composition; they would perhaps prefer a CD from a Top 40 chart or some rock classic from the 70s. Yet the option of having professional musicians still exists today. There is a greater range of choices available, yes, but the ability to enjoy more (if not all, cheaply) also exists. And, of course, the classical music of the past is still around. Something for everyone.

Time preference

Before we continue, we have to point out that even though people should be free to make their choices, there is an effect that is often overlooked: the change in time preference as the result of state interference, particularly democracy. As Hans-Hermann Hoppe points out,

“democracy is seen as promoting an increase in the social rate of time preference (present-orientation) or the “infantilization” of society. It results in continually increased taxes, paper money and paper money inflation, an unending flood of legislation, and a steadily growing “public” debt. By the same token, democracy leads to lower savings, increased legal uncertainty, moral relativism, lawlessness, and crime. Further, democracy is a tool for wealth and income confiscation and redistribution. It involves the legislative “taking” of the property of some — the haves of something — and the “giving” of it to others — the have-nots of things. And since it is presumably something valuable that is being redistributed — of which the haves have too much and the have-nots too little — any such redistribution implies that the incentive to be of value or produce something valuable is systematically reduced. In other words, the proportion of not-so-good people and not-so-good personal traits, habits, and forms of conduct and appearance will increase, and life in society will become increasingly unpleasant.”

Thus, when we say that people should be free to make choices based on their subjective valuations, we do not necessarily have to condone them. Instead, we must recognize that we live in an environment with higher than normal time preference and in a free society choices would be considerably different (for more on this subject, read Hoppe’s “Time Preference, Government, and the Process of Decivilization”). Having mentioned the time preference factor, we now continue our analysis.

Freedom and wealth

People living in countries with “free” economies literally have money left over; efficiency continues to improve and thus wages increase. We do not plow the fields all day to survive. Once the basic necessities have been satisfied we can move on to other needs. No longer do we have to be rich or an aristocrat to have access to entertainment, live in air-conditioned houses, or travel. We have more options now than was ever possible but elitists condemn the population for their choices and would prefer a world where fashion, music and tastes are guided by the romantic enlightenment instead of one’s preferences, or even worse, the preferences of government.

This anti-civilization attitude is dangerous and counterproductive. It aims to replace everyone’s means of creating value with government intervention. This misses a vital point about how value is created. As Michael Rozeff argued in “Why Free Markets Succeed and Governments Fail,” no one is better at creating value for the individual than that individual himself, via the free market. He further stated:

“How do free markets succeed in encouraging value creation? … As Hoppe has argued, if each of us keeps what we own without it being taken by government, each of us has the maximum incentive to increase what we own and make the best use of it so as to create value. As Mises has pointed out, free markets have prices. Prices reduce the dimensionality of the value creation problem. We can easily find out what something costs and compare it to our personal valuations. Businesses have a clear measure of success: profit or loss. Government does not. One of Rockwell’s favorite themes is that accountability and responsiveness are characteristic of business activity in free markets because of the direct link between service to buyers and profit and loss. There is no such direct link between voters and government, nor is there a clear link between a given product and a given vote. Hayek and others have emphasized that value creation requires specific knowledge that is available only to individuals, that is, it’s widely dispersed. Free markets are the natural way for individuals to bring that knowledge to bear in their choices. Mises, Rothbard and Austrian economists emphasize the role of free market entrepreneurial activity in seeking out new opportunities for value creation and bringing them to fruition. By contrast, governmental entrepreneurialism is directed at new restrictions that promote value destruction.”

To a certain extent, we have become spoiled by our own success. We seem to have forgotten that increased abundance, and the additional choices it brings, are part and parcel of freedom. There are even those among the intelligentsia who would seemingly decry choice. Some would argue, for example, that having too many choices creates frustration. Studies noted by Dr. Barry Schwartz indicate that too many choices actually make people sad! He stated as much in “A Nation of Second Guesses” from a couple of years back. While we find Dr. Schwartz’s data interesting, if not compelling, we think he misses the point somewhat. And we’re not alone. In “Don’t Attack Choice!“, fellow LRC contributor and libertarian scholar Tibor Machan states:

“I do not want to dispute these findings but point out that they are largely beside the point when the issue of wide range of selections comes into focus. But first, there is the problem, also, that it doesn’t much matter that many folks are frustrated by too many selections of ice cream or pharmaceuticals or whatever. Nothing at all follows from this. Indeed, the point of having a wide selection is not to provide various individuals with many alternatives — most individuals know pretty well the small selection of alternatives they want and can go right to where that small selection can be found. When they shop, for example, they do not go everywhere goods are on display at a grocery or department stores but merely visit the small region where their preferred selections are available. The point of having a very large selection over all is to make it possible for all varieties of individuals to find something they would need or want. It is all about individualism, the rejection of the ancient doctrine of one size fits all, not about pleasing everyone with all the selections that are produced.”

Our abundance then, is not necessarily aimed at a single individual, but all individuals. And without this abundance of choice, many individuals would not be able to have their specific needs met. The free market then, provides the best of both worlds — the proper range of choices for an individual and the proper scope of choices for all individuals! Further, in a free society there would be no one forcing people to behave in certain ways. One could literally be free to not be involved in any market choice at all and live in total autarky. Not wise, but possible, with extremely hard work. Yet the same is not true with government intervention. Our choices are limited wherever intervention exists.

The thing that all westerners should value most — if not property rights, individual liberty, the argument from morality or the non-aggression principle — is choice, and nothing does a better job of providing that wonderful opportunity to all than the free market. It’s a shame when those who seek a truly egalitarian society forget how one is created. In order to spread the abundance that spoils us all to more, it is necessary to allow all to (possibly) fail on their way to achieving it. But the allowance of failure is a secondary point. What is important, as Machan states, is that the multitude of different individuals have the best chance of getting their varied choices met. Certainly, it is better to be “overwhelmed” by the abundance of choices than to have so few that choosing is irrelevant.

Some of this “spoilage” might stem from the fact that people do not seem to understand what having a choice means anymore. This parallels quite nicely the concept of “learned stupidity” that we examined a few essays ago. In some ways, we have forgotten both how to choose and why we must be allowed to choose. Similarly, we seem to have accepted those critical areas where we have little choice. We decry the abundance of mayonnaise choices while simultaneously accepting the lack of choice in cable TV providers. Not surprisingly — at least from the perspective of Austrian economics — the reason for the abundance in one area and the dearth of choice in the other is exactly the same: the state. Where the free market is allowed to flourish, choice is abundant. Where the state seeks to “protect” the public, choice is hard to find.

To those unfamiliar with Austrian economics this might seem counterintuitive. It might seem more reasonable to think that the state’s involvement would actually preclude markets from devolving so much that only one or two companies provide a particular service. But as Rothbard noted long ago, the exact opposite is true. It is only with the cooperation, and in fact with the support of the state that monopolies can exist. Without the state’s help, any profitable market with insufficient competition is entered by new companies seeking to “join the fun” and so, the consumer benefits by way of increasing choices. Conversely, markets where additional competition is thwarted are inhabited by few firms — and generally these firms are much less responsive to consumer needs.

Visit any grocery store and you’ll find several different types of almost everything. Heck, it would not be surprising to see four choices for black olives on any visit! Four choices of olives. Seriously, who needs that much choice? But most of us only have one choice of company to provide cable television service. (Throw in satellite and one might be able to claim two choices.) Why is that? Simply put: regulation. The state, via its largely unnecessary involvement, has successfully made certain that one provider supplies everyone with something that few, if any, in most markets can do without. If you can find any example of a similar misapplication of resources in a truly free market, you’ll be the first!

The real tragedy is that by almost any measure, life is better, and “choices” are more plentiful now than in any previous time. So clearly, if choice is to survive, we must allow that which provides it to flourish: liberty.

369819,"It’s fascinating to re-read a book nearly forty years later. To look back upon historical events through the eyes of someone on the other side of the process. Today, when we think of Vietnam, images of helicopters franticly scurrying away from the US embassy in downtown Saigon come to mind. Boat people braving uncertain seas and predictably vicious pirates to escape a concealed holocaust. The killing fields of Cambodia.

American ‘baby boomers’ reflect upon the forced draft anxiety that overheated our youthful years. Country Joe and the Fish’s Fixin’ to Die Rag was an anthem of sorts:

And it’s one, two three, what are we fighting for Don’t ask me, I don’t give a damn Next stop is Vietnam And it’s five, six, seven, open up them pearly gates, Ours is not to wonder why, Whoopee! I just know I’m gonna die.

As the 2004 presidential campaign revealed, resentments over what was widely seen to be an unnecessary defeat still smolder. For the first time, the triumphal American saga of winning every war “we” got into crashed and burned. Pop culture of the 70’s disco era tried to bury the shame in nihilistic silliness.

An unnecessary defeat. This is one theme of the book We Were Soldiers, Once, and Young. Political computations relegated a live war, with American kids bleeding and dying, to the status of a low budget sideshow, fought to tie, not to win. In the aftermath of Watergate, a rabidly partisan American congress cut off South Vietnam’s air supply, violating treaty obligations in order to sever the lifeline of materiel. The careers of an elite political class took precedence over the lives and deaths of real human beings, American and Asian.

An unnecessary defeat. Yet, as the 1958 book The Ugly American (William J. Lederer and Eugene Burdick) pointed out, the battle for hearts and minds in southeast Asia was actually a myriad tiny battles, conversations with people one at a time. All too often, the Americans were the amateurs, political hacks who lived well hobnobbing with one another and wealthy locals. Foreign aid, you recall, is when poor people in rich countries are taxed to engorge rich people in poor countries. It’s still going on. See the irate legate’s blog http://diplomadic.blogspot.com/ for current illustrations of this dismal practice.

The Ugly American alternates heroes and villains, helpful folks and pompous buffoons. The “good guys” are those who actually live with the people, learn their languages, and offer real-world solutions to grass-roots needs. (Kennedy’s “Peace Corps” pursued this ideal.) The black hats are the guys in pin stripes, tax-consuming elites with no regard for the real people sacrificed on the altars of their massive projects.

Yet, how can poverty be overcome? Can a well-intentioned philanthropist actually make a difference? A good friend who worked as an engineer in an Asian country for nearly two decades says “third world” squalor can be conquered  but it’s a multi-generational project. The most frustrated students in tropical agriculture schools, rumor has it, are burned-out Peace Corps volunteers.

OK, so we can’t change the world in three easy steps. Can we just turn our backs on our world, and go off to create a new world of our own? The Southern Agrarian writers so beloved of certain “kinist” and “communitarian” groups thought so.

A novel worth considering in this context is Paul Theroux’s The Mosquito Coast. Mr. Fixit goes to jungle, gets mugged by reality, self-destructs. Imagine Swiss Family Robinson meets Lord of the Flies. The inventions burning in protagonist Allie Fox’s mind turn fire into ice. He names these emblems of secular American transformative power “little man” and “fat boy.” As Fox carves his rigidly secular techno utopia out of the jungle, his children join local kids to create a secret place of their own, complete with everything the father hates  play money, a pretend school and church, indigenous resources. In the end, the godless superman brings nothing but death to his brave new world.

After wading through nearly 400 pages of vivid description and gripping psychological narrative, I recommend the movie by that title, starring Harrison Ford as Allie Fox. The film is faithful to the book in plot, characterizations, and atmosphere, and takes less time.

Once again, this is a story that resonates with people “of a certain age.” As the Olivet Discourse (Matthew 24, Mark 13, Luke 24) indicates, it’s normal for people to confuse the end of their world with the end of the world. When America’s self-image deconstructed in the late 60s, several apocalyptic movements emerged. Drug-dazed hippies “turned on to Jesus,” dropped out of school and adult life, and created a plethora of Christian communes. These bastard hybrids of family and church exploited the inconsistencies of both, while undermining the ability of the communards to function as church men, as family men.

On the other extreme, pagan gaeia worshippers went “back to the land,” seeking to return to the womb of Mother Earth. Peasantry, subsistence living, acquired an ideological cachet among the true believers. Very few men wearing Harley Davidson tee shirts actually own a hawg. Very few subscribers to Mother Earth News know how much capital and sheer hard work it takes to wrest a living from the soil. But, the agrarian ideal still holds appeal to those daunted by the complexities of life. The Y2K craze revealed the market for this view of life, this desire to see the world around smashed down to size, in order to provide opportunities for those who could not excel in the world as it is.

The bottom line? History can be warped, but not finally shaped, by the personal or corporate schemes that self-anointed elites make for others. Speaking as a Christian, I must assert that what happens in my house matters more than what happens in the White House. In a normal home, men and women made in the image of God grow up to become producers, not parasites. With an independent streak, not conditioned to bow before Caesar’s bloody altars. Truly creative thinkers, who will find new resources in the created order around them, rather than docile pawns of statist “wise men.” As J.R.R. Tolkein said during his nation’s apocalypse, “No man can estimate what is really happening at the present sub specie aeternitatis. All we know, and that to a large extent by direct experience, is that evil labours with vast power and perpetual success  in vain: preparing always only the soil for unexpected good to sprout in.”

456006,"“It occurred to me…” Academic gowns show universities are medieval institutions being dragged kicking and screaming into the 17th century.

Global Warming was just one issue The Club of Rome (TCOR) targeted in its campaign to reduce world population. In 1993 the Club’s co-founder, Alexander King with Bertrand Schneider wrote The First Global Revolution stating,

“The common enemy of humanity is man. In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.”

They believe all these problems are created by humans but exacerbated by a growing population using technology. “Changed attitudes and behavior” basically means what it has meant from the time Thomas Malthus raised The Deliberate Corrupt... Tim Ball Check Amazon for Pricing. the idea the world was overpopulated. He believed charity and laws to help the poor were a major cause of the problem and it was necessary to reduce population through rules and regulations. TCOR ideas all ended up in the political activities of the Rio 1992 conference organized by Maurice Strong (a TCOR member) under the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The assumptions and objectives became the main structure of Agenda 21, the master plan for the 21st Century. The global warming threat was confronted at Rio through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It was structured to predetermine scientific proof that human CO2 was one contribution of the “common enemy”.

The IPCC was very successful. Despite all the revelations about corrupted science and their failed predictions (projections) CO2 remains central to global attention about energy and environment. For example, several websites, many provided by government, list CO2 output levels for new and used cars. Automobile companies work to build cars with lower CO2 output and, if for no other reason than to appear green, use it in advertising. The automotive industry, which has the scientists to know better, collectively surrenders to eco-bullying about CO2. They are not alone. They get away with it because they pass on the unnecessary costs to a befuddled “trying to do the right thing” population.

TCOR applied Thomas Malthus’s claim of a race to exhaustion of food to all resources. Both Malthus and COR believe limiting population was mandatory. Darwin took a copy of Malthus’s Essay on Population with him and remarked on its influence on his evolutionary theory in his Beagle journal in September 1838. The seeds of distortion about overpopulation were sown in Darwin’s acceptance of Malthus’s claims.

Paul Johnson’s biography of Charles Darwin comments on the contradiction between Darwin’s scientific methods and his acceptance of their omission in Malthus.

Malthus’s aim was to discourage charity and reform the existing poor laws, which, he argued, encourage the destitute to breed and so aggravated the problem. That was not Darwin’s concern. What struck him was the contrast between geometrical progression (breeding) and arithmetical progression (food supplies). Not being a mathematician he did not check the reasoning and accuracy behind Malthus’s law… in fact, Malthus’s law was nonsense. He did not prove it. He stated it. What strikes one reading Malthus is the lack of hard evidence throughout. Why did this not strike Darwin? A mystery. Malthus’s only “proof” was the population expansion of the United States. The Little Green Book ... James Delingpole Best Price: $$4.00 Buy New $$3.99 (as of 10:10 EST - Details)

There was no point at which Malthus’s geometrical/arithmetical rule could be made to square with the known facts. And he had no reason whatsoever to extrapolate from the high American rates to give a doubling effect every 25 years everywhere and in perpetuity. He swallowed Malthusianism because it fitted his emotional need, he did not apply the tests and deploy the skepticism that a scientist should. It was a rare lapse from the discipline of his profession. But it was an important one.

Darwin’s promotion of Malthus undoubtedly gave the ideas credibility they didn’t deserve. Since then the Malthusian claim has dominated science, social science and latterly environmentalism. Even now many who accept the falsity of global warming due to humans continue to believe overpopulation is a real problem.

Overpopulation was central in all TCOR’s activities. Three books were important to their message, Paul Ehrlich’s The Population Bomb (1968) and Ecoscience: Population, Resources and Environment (1977) co-authored with John Holdren, Obama’s Science Czar, and Meadows et al., Limits to Growth, published in 1972 that anticipated the IPCC approach of computer model predictions (projections). The latter wrote

If the present growth trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years.

Here is what the TCOR web site says about the book.

They created a computing model which took into account the relations between various global developments and produced computer simulations for alternative scenarios. Part of the modelling were different amounts of possibly available resources, different levels of agricultural productivity, birth control or environmental protection. Unstoppable Global War... S. Fred Singer, Dennis... Best Price: $$0.10 Buy New $$5.98 (as of 06:05 EST - Details)

They estimated the current amount of a resource, determined the rate of consumption, and added an expanding demand because of increasing industrialization and population growth to determine, with simple linear trend analysis, that the world was doomed.

Economist Julian Simon challenged TCOR and Ehrlich’s assumptions.

In response to Ehrlich’s published claim that “If I were a gambler, I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000″ – a proposition Simon regarded as too silly to bother with – Simon countered with “a public offer to stake US$$10,000 … on my belief that the cost of non-government-controlled raw materials (including grain and oil) will not rise in the long run.”

Simon proposed,

You could name your own terms: select any raw material you wanted – copper, tin, whatever – and select any date in the future, “any date more than a year away,” and Simon would bet that the commodity’s price on that date would be lower than what it was at the time of the wager.

Global warming used the idea that CO2 would increase to harmful levels because of increasing industrialization and expanding populations. The political manipulation of climate science was linked to development and population control in various ways. Here are comments from a PBS interview with Senator Tim Wirth in response to the question,

I think a number of things happened in the late 1980s. First of all, there were the [NASA scientist Jim] Hansen hearings [in 1988]. … We had introduced a major piece of legislation. Amazingly enough, it was an 18-part climate change bill; it had population in it, conservation, and it had nuclear in it. It had everything that we could think of that was related to climate change. … And so we had this set of hearings, and Jim Hansen was the star witness.

Wikipedia says about Wirth,

In the State Department, he worked with Vice President Al Gore on global environmental and population issues, supporting the administration’s views on global warming. A supporter of the proposed Kyoto Protocol Wirth announced the U.S.’s commitment to legally binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions.

Gore chaired the 1988 “Hansen” Senate Hearing and was central to the promotion of population as basic to all other problems. He led the US delegation to the September 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo Egypt.

That conference emerged from Rio 1992 where they linked population to all other supposed problems.

Explicitly integrating population into economic and development strategies will both speed up the pace of sustainable development and poverty alleviation and contribute to the achievement of population objectives and an improved quality of life of the population.

This theme was central to Rio+20 held in June 2012 and designed to re-emphasize Rio 1992. Donu2019t Sell Your Co... Harold Ambler Best Price: $$1.65 Buy New $$12.79 (as of 06:20 EST - Details)

The Numbers

The world is not overpopulated. That fallacy is perpetuated in all environmental research, policy and planning including global warming and latterly climate change. So what are the facts about world population?

The US Census Bureau provides a running estimate of world population. It was 6,994,551,619 on February 15, 2012. On October 30, 2011 the UN claimed it passed 7 billion; the difference is 5,448,381. This is more than the population of 129 countries of the 242 listed by Wikipedia. It confirms most statistics are crude estimates, especially those of the UN who rely on individual member countries, yet no accurate census exists for any of them

Population density is a more meaningful measure. Most people are concentrated in coastal flood plains and deltas, which are about 5 percent of the land. Compare Canada, the second largest country in the world with approximately 35.3 million residents estimated in 2013 with California where an estimated 37.3 million people lived in 2010. Some illustrate the insignificance of the density issue by putting everyone in a known region. For example, Texas at 7,438,152,268,800 square feet divided by the 2012 world population 6,994,551,619 yields 1063.4 square feet per person. Fitting all the people in an area is different from them being able to live there. Most of the world is unoccupied by humans.

Population geographers separate ecumene, the inhabited area, from non-ecumene the uninhabited areas. The distribution of each changes over time because of technology, communications and food production capacity. Many of these changes deal with climate controls. Use of fire and clothing allowed survival in colder regions, while irrigation offset droughts and allowed settlement in arid regions. Modern environmentalists would likely oppose all of these touted evolutionary advances.

Ironically The Fallacious Problem is The Solution

It all sounds too familiar in the exploitation of science for a political and personal agenda. But there is an even bigger tragedy because the development the TCOR and IPCC condemn is actually the solution.

All of the population predictions Ehrlich and others made were wrong, but more important and damning was they ignored another pattern that was identified in 1929 and developed over the same period as the Mathusian claims. It is known as the Demographic Transition.

It shows and statistics confirm, population declines as nations industrialize and the economy grows. It is so dramatic in developed countries that the population pyramid results in insufficient young people to support the massively expensive social programs for the elderly. Some countries offset this with migration, but they are simply creating other problems. Countries that don’t allow or severely limit migration such as Japan face completely different problems. Some countries offer incentives for having more than two children, such as the announcement by Vladimir Putin in Russia. China took draconian, inhuman, steps by limiting families to one child. The irony, although there is nothing funny about it, is they are now the largest producer of CO2 and their economy booms. If they had simply studied the demographic transition and let things take a normal course the tragedies already incurred and yet to unfold could have been avoided.

The world is not overpopulated. Malthus began the idea suggesting the population would outgrow the food supply. Currently food production is believed sufficient to feed 25 billion people and growing. The issue is that in the developing world some 60 percent of production never makes it to the table. Developed nations cut this figure to 30 percent primarily through refrigeration. In their blind zeal those who brought you the IPCC fiasco cut their teeth on the technological solution to this problem – better and cheaper refrigeration. The CFC/ ozone issue was artificially created to ban CFCs and introduce global control through the Montreal Protocol. It, like the Kyoto Protocol was a massive, expensive, unnecessary solution to a non-existent problem.

TCOR and later UNEP’s Agenda 21 adopted and expanded the Malthusian idea of overpopulation to all resources making it the central tenet of all their politics and policies. The IPCC was set up to assign the blame of global warming and latterly climate change on human produced CO2 from an industrialized expanding population. They both developed from false assumptions, used manipulated data and science, which they combined into computer models whose projections were, not surprisingly, wrong. The result is the fallacy of global warming due to human CO2 is a subset built on the fallacy of overpopulation.

217325,"Some Democrats are hinting at the word impeachment when they talk about George W. Bush and his ""lying us into war"" scandal. Heck, I’d support impeachment in a minute, even though I voted for the guy and despise most Democrats. But no one, not even Sidney Blumenthal or Florida Sen. Bob Graham, really believes the president will be subjected to this fate by a GOP Congress.

But I have come up with a better way to void the Bush election. It’s something I learned from the Bush Justice Department, which is acting with the same regard to the Constitution and the rule of law as the Clinton Justice Department under Janet Reno.

We can simply use the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to void the election. It’s simple really. No woman or black person or Jewish person or Muslim or You Name It has been elected the federal government’s chief executive officer — ever. That’s clearly a sign of discrimination. So Justice Department lawyers can declare a violation and impose a new system for replacing the president.

Before you toss this out as a silly idea, consider a news story from Monday’s Los Angeles Times. In Vista, Calif., a northern San Diego County town with a 40 percent Latino population, no Latino surnamed person has ever been elected to the City Council — ever. There are no allegations of vote-fixing, or other forms of election fraud, or even of intimidation against Latino voters. One local Hispanic activist told the Times he has never heard a complaint. ""I don’t think there’s a problem here.""

As local officials pointed out in the news story, there is an obvious explanation for the disparity: Few Latinos are registered to vote. And, unstated but obvious, is that a good bit of the city’s Latino population probably is in the United States illegally, and — short of being given a little walking around money and some phony registration cards — most illegals aren’t interested in voting in city council races.

But that’s not good enough for the Justice Department. A former tow-truck manager with a last name, Vega, told the Times that he ran for city council and finished fourth out of six candidates. He doesn’t know why he didn’t win. That sort of evidence of unfairness apparently is good enough for the feds.

""Justice Department investigators want to determine whether a pattern emerges in Vista,"" according to the Times. ""They plan to check whether members of minorities and whites vote differently; whether whites in Vista vote as a block against minority candidates; and whether whites are able to beat minority candidates, even when minority voters are unified at the polls, said Justice Department spokesman Jorge Martinez.""

Amazing. The Justice Department is investigating whether people in Vista vote properly. Note what they say. It’s apparently illegal if white people vote in blocks for candidates, but a good thing when minority voters are ""unified at the polls."" Even more ridiculous: Martinez told the newspaper the department only needs to find disparities in voting before coming down like a sledgehammer against the city. ""Intent and cause are irrelevant, he said.""

It seems likely the feds are going to come into Vista and demand the city embrace a district council system, with at least one of the districts gerrymandered to assure a Latino surnamed council member. Currently, the city elects its officials in at-large seats, meaning each council member is elected from voters in the entire city.

One can argue the value of at-large seats versus districts. I have endorsed a local city initiative that would create districts, as a means to create neighborhood control. But the city’s residents would decide to embrace the system, not the feds, and the districts are based on the natural neighborhood breakdowns, not on ethnic enclaves.

The situation in Vista is tyranny, pure and simple. And it undermines the validity of the democratic process. I know. Elections are rarely worth defending, and certainly are not the holy things modern-day majoritarians say they are. Still, there is something unusually appalling about using the federal government to assure that a ""proper"" number of minorities is elected to the city council. It’s not too much of a leap to think that elections might be invalidated based on improper ethnic balances and such things.

Which leads me back to President Bush. Because he won’t stop his own Justice Department from pursuing tyranny, Americans ought to use the same apparatus to remove him from office.

It won’t happen, but it’s fun thinking about the possibility.

735403,"The water sprinklers turned on just as I sat down on the bench near my patio. It was already very late at night. The sound of water spraying the ground was itself a relief from the oppressive Texas heat. The summer was unbearable that year. Temperatures did not go lower than 95 degrees during the night, and the humidity was so high that the air felt heavy and muggy throughout the season.

I stood under the sprinklers for a few seconds, just to soak in the moisture so I could endure the time I was outside. The mist of the water felt cooling and I began to clear away my daughters’ doll stroller and wagon. I had no intentions of tripping over them in the morning.

It was almost a comfort to be standing under the dark Texas sky away from the merciless sun that beat down from morning until sundown. Yard work and fiddling around with small tasks outside was a good distraction for the moment. When the water sprinklers stopped I sat back down on my uncomfortable wooden bench.

My children were peacefully asleep inside. None of them had any idea how their lives had changed. How were they going to handle this? Ten hours earlier I found out that my married life was over. Since that moment, I felt like death swallowed me alive. I was ready to escape the confines of my house and find refuge in my yard so I could see the sky. It has always been a comforting thing to do.

Gazing at the stars took my mind off my bleak future for a while. There is a lot of imagination to be had when looking up rather than down. I looked for the brightest star in the night sky, something I’ve done for many years. A person can even see color if he looks at them long enough. I found one right next to the moon. And it was a full moon too. Sigh… At least the moon’s light is only a reflection, so it is a lot softer than the full blaze of the summer sun. Its light reminds me of candle light. Soft and steady, it brings gentleness into the darkness. I needed a dose of that kind of light at the moment.

The night has different sounds, too. Here in Texas we have chirping crickets and locusts. It’s a symphony with the nightingale singing along and the mosquito making its buzzing interruption. It’s a different world sitting out under the stars. There is something comforting about the night; something that brings us to a place of rest. We always know that the morning will come; no matter what.

There are still times when I am afraid of the night. There are shadows and creepy noises. Then there are those moments where we are seized with such a purpose that we fear nothing. I remember as a 6-year-old in Bavaria, I wanted to see Kristkindl at night during the Christmas season. When I woke in the night my room was very dark. Normally I would feel afraid, but not that night. I felt my way to the closet to put on my shoes. I opened the door to our patio and stood outside in my nightgown under a starry night and waited. It was freezing cold but I intensely looked up just to see if I could catch a glimpse of Kristkindl. I really wasn’t sure what I was looking for. I just knew it must be a young Angel-girl with wings flying through the sky to bring the Christmas gifts to all the little children. I probably would have stayed out there all night if I hadn’t started getting very cold. Shivering and a little disappointed I made my way back to bed. One thing I remember was seeing many bright stars.

As a 9-year-old in Germany, one of my best friends was a boy named Peter. He and I had great talks together looking into the heavens at night. He was my fourth-grade teacher’s oldest son, and played the trumpet in our band. He was about three years older than me. I played the clarinet and that’s how we became friends. After band practice, which we held upstairs in the old corner guesthouse, we took the long way home through the village and up to the hill where I lived. During the fall and winter months, it was already dark outside by the time practice was over. Halfway up the hill to my home we would stop at Frau Jahna’s garden wall, sit down and look up. I remember there was always a chill in the air, but we were not at all fazed by it. He was the one who told me that the light we see twinkling in the night sky could be from a star that is already extinguished, and the light that comes from earth and travels to a star may be the light of Roman times, depending from what time the light was from.

Ah, it was all so fascinating. Once I jokingly tried to convince him that there really was a face in the moon by pointing the facial features out to him, but I couldn’t convince him. And so we headed home, bidding each other good-bye and going our separate ways once we reached my house. Each time we walked home we continued to wonder about what was happening up there in the sky. Those were my first experiences with someone else where we explored thoughts together and still remained in wonderment of never quite knowing. It kept my interest open to hear more.

The night can reveal more good things. As teenagers, my brother had a room next to mine down in the basement. We were the oldest and had our own rooms. One night he came to my room while I had Uriah Heep playing on the record player. It was already very late and I was kind of daydreaming on my bed. The only light in the room was from a single burning candle. He sat down on my bed and we started talking about music. Of course our conversation also included our current crushes and school. Everything was discussed in depth. A few awkward moments were smoothed out with a fleeing smile.

That night we dropped our masks. I no longer saw my ""dorky"" brother but saw a caring and witty person sitting in front of me. We listened to each other and took note of what was said. We didn’t have to pretend anymore. It took the weight off our shoulders that helped us through our lives and strengthened our relationship. That night we became inseparable. We still call each other almost every week to talk and laugh. We can accept each other unconditionally, because we freely give back to each other without manipulation. That night he was there for me, talking to me for several hours on the phone. He wouldn’t hang up until he knew I was going to be all right.

Back under the Texas sky, a breeze rustled through the big oak tree. Ah, it felt good. There are no words to describe the deliverance from agony when a gust of wind whisks through the stifling air. I sat in silence gazing up into the heavens again. Is my fate determined by the stars, or is the place I find myself to be an Advent that will usher in a new life? Has there ever been complete darkness on earth? There’s has always been a flicker of light somewhere within our darkest moments that we want to grasp and hold on to. And sometimes it’s the only thing we have left — a flicker. And I found myself to be at that place.

Something died that night. It was only the rhythmic pounding of my heartbeat within my chest that kept me alive. It let me know that there’s still life in there. Its beat was a muffled but desperate pounding in my ears. Wasn’t there a life that gives light to everyone? ""The light shines through the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it"" (John 1:5). Wasn’t there a story that said ""…don’t be afraid, I bring you good news of great joy for everyone…"" (Luke 2:10)?

My children came to my mind. They relied on my sanity. They needed a mother whose head is together, but I also knew it would take time. I thought of Mary who heard the stories the shepherds told to everyone — The Good News — and how she quietly treasured these things in her heart and thought about them often (Luke 2:19). Can I find my strength there? Is that where I can find something to hold onto, and so our lives can move forward? Didn’t my mother and grandmother light the four candles on the Advent wreath every Sunday before Christmas exactly for that reason?

Stories actually take on a meaning when we realize we are in the story. Before that they can just be words; pointless words quoted out of a book. But when the stories in the book become real in the lives of people, we’re in the Word. And on that humid night in Texas, I found my hold in the Word. It was an early Christmas present that wasn’t wrapped in a box with a pretty bow. It looked more like broken parts lying before me as I sat in my yard under the tree. These were tender parts in swaddling clothes that will grow, be cuddled and are scented like the smell of a newborn babe. There’s sweetness in life, too, even when it’s dark and broken. Does not the sweet smell of the honeysuckle linger during the night? Does not the seed sprout once it fell to the ground? It’s that kind of life which conquers the bitterest death. It’s the kind of life that flickers in the dark night of the soul.

The drumbeat I heard in my ears settled down to a calmer rhythm. The fear of the night was conquered with a purpose. I could not see any angels in the heavens, or a star guiding the way. There were no shepherds announcing the news of the Savior being born. But I heard the call, like trumpets sounding in my heart. I got up from my bench and headed for the back door. I took one last look at the stars and there I determined that I would follow the Shepherd’s call. I opened the door and entered a new life.

Weve all seen it before  the pocket knife that you couldnt cut warm butter with on a hot July afternoon. Its a little rusty, the joints are gunked up with who-knows-what, and the only thing its good for is opening letters. Almost as bad (or worse depending on your viewpoint) are the kitchen knives that cant cut tomatoes, or anything remotely tough without repeated sawing.

Theres no reason it has to be this way. I think sharpening edged tools is one of the more useful outdoor skills, and it has a glorious payoff in the home as well. The good news is that its no longer an art practiced exclusively by mountain men who eat only bear meat. The old days of nothing but Arkansas stones and a little luck are over. Its really not hard at all; you just need the right equipment.

Lets start with knives.

Sharpening Knives

The essential sharpening process isnt rocket science. With an abrasive material, you remove a small amount of metal to restore a clean, sharp edge, and you remove this metal using a low-friction environment so heat build-up doesnt destroy the temper of your blade.

This isnt meant to be a piece on metallurgy. There are people way geekier than I who can give you a lesson on the finer points of the hundreds of different alloys with their various properties. Its just about sharpening stuff.

My preference in a good knife is a high carbon content. Super-high carbon content knives are almost always not stainless, but will discolor over time to a dull gray. I happen to think they look beautiful, but thats my opinion. They do rust if they are kept damp, but a little oil and a little care keeps them from rusting. Goat cheese will darken your knife immediately, so if you want to get a good patina on the blade, just slice off a hunk for your bagel.

Better knife manufacturers use a stainless steel with a higher carbon content. These are better called stains less steel, as they will rust if not properly cared for, but theyre easier to maintain than a pure carbon steel. Knife companies like Benchmade and Grohmann use a stainless steel with a carbon content that is very high, so the knife blade will last. Less expensive knives (low-end Wal-Mart pocket knives like K-bar, etc.) are low carbon content stainless and will not last under typical use, but then theyre hoping youll lose the knife before it breaks. Most people do.

Techniques

Sharpening in years past was difficult, as it necessitated keeping the proper angle on the knife blade so that you had a clean, consistent, flat edge, rather than a rolled edge that dulled quickly. One tended, without any sort of guide, to rock the blade and create an inefficient cutting edge. A master carpenter could free-hand an angle like a machine, but most of us cant.

Tools to keep this from happening are now common. One of the more popular sharpening tools is the Spyderco Triangle Sharpener (and others of its type). It works on the principle that while the human eye has a hard time eyeballing a 21 degree angle, pretty much everyone knows what a straight, right angle looks like. By angling the sharpening media, the guesswork and much of the imprecision is removed, and all you have to do is move the knife down the media in a cutting motion toward the base, alternating sides. If you follow the directions, you can shave with the blade of your knife when youre finished.

I had never tested the angle of the Triangle Sharpener. I used a level to get a good reference for the bevel gauge, and referenced off that (I know it doesnt look plumb I promise it was). As you can see from the picture, the angle of the sharpener is just over 20 degrees. Thats a good angle for most tasks.

I often carry a Triangle Sharpener (its wee) when traveling to visit friends. I can usually sharpen every knife in the house in less than an hour or two, and theyre always grateful. Its relaxing, fun, Zen-like work, requiring little skill but a fair amount of concentration.

Another approach is to lock down the angle using a guide. One such type is the DMT (Diamond Materials Technology) sharpening system, which uses a clamp-on guide to make sure you keep a consistent angle. You can choose an angle depending on the type of edge you want. The lower the angle, the sharper you can make an edge, but it is a less durable edge. Scalpels can be used for surgery, but theyll dull in seconds if you try to cut something other than flesh. A meat cleaver wants a higher angle, because you want a durable edge, even if its not razor sharp.

Heres sharpening in action with a Spyderco:

Before you commit yourself though, you might want to consider the following – – –

But let’s say we decide to take New York Mayor Giuliani’s prescription seriously. We “change the nature of society,” and arrange to “have a police officer every place.” Would that work?

If you take a close look at pictures from the Boston Marathon bombing, you will see that when those pressure-cooker bombs exploded, both sides of the street were lined with police officers.

So even if you manage to “have a police officer every place,” that won’t protect you.

And the FBI can’t save you either – – –

In fact, FBI tactics may seriously endanger you.

Here’s the problem in a nutshell – – –

The list of vulnerabilities is perilously long in Baltimore, as it is just about everywhere in the United States. … ”So how would you defend against frogmen blowing up half the harbor?” I asked [Sgt.

So clearly, we’re not protected from terrorists. And can’t be. It’s called “Fourth Generation Warfare.” There’s plenty more proof, but unless you’re a masochist, you probably don’t want to know.

OMAHA, Neb. (AP) – Investment guru Warren Buffett offered a bleak prediction for the nation’s national security, saying a terrorist attack on American soil is “virtually a certainty.” … “We’re going to have something in the way of a major nuclear event in this country,” said Buffett … “It will happen. Whether it will happen in 10 years or 10 minutes, or 50 years … it’s virtually a certainty.” –Billionaire Predicts Nuclear Attack, JOE RUFF, Associated Press

And don’t forget Dave Barry’s “Big Trouble” — the movie that was postponed because it was too realistic. It stars a backpack nuke smuggled into Florida – – –

OK, forget about the nukes. But before you do, do you remember that ABC news team which, to test U.S. defenses, toted depleted uranium into the U.S., definitively proving pissed-off folks could smuggle nukes into the heartland?

They did it twice, once through the premiere checkpoint in the Port of New York and then, the following year, through The Port of Los Angeles.

So now you have an idea of the first part of the title, “Why You BETTER Stop Terrorism.”

And about now, you may be thinking things like “That @#$$&ing writer, the $$@$$!@rd tells us we BETTER Stop Terrorism then convinces us we can’t! Get me a rope and find me a nice stout tree branch!”

Now hold on a minute! I hope I’ve convinced you that you can’t be protected from terrorism, not that you can’t stop it. I know it’s subtle, but there’s a difference.

Here’s the key:

“You could kill all the terrorists in Afghanistan, all the terrorists in the world. You could hang Osama bin Laden in sight of the White House. You still wouldn’t have solved the problem because you will have created a whole new generation of terrorists.” –Col. Richard Dunn, October, 2001

The torture and other abuses at Gitmo, Abu Ghraib, Kandahar, etc. are regularly cited as main recruiting tools for foreign terrorists as are U.S. drone killings. And then, among other international crimes, there’s Uncle Sam’s unjustified and illegal invasion of Iraq. It’s one of those gifts that just keeps on giving – – –

LYDIA WILSON: …They had been found guilty of terrorism for various vehicle explosions and assassinations within Kirkuk [a devastated Iraqi city]. … And when I gave them a chance to talk and to ask more open-ended questions, it became very clear that they were fueled by a lot of anger, anger primarily against the Americans….

And don’t forget all those other countries Uncle Sam bombed, droned, invaded, etc., currently including Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Somalia, Yemen, Libya — and I’ve probably missed a few. And the wedding parties, funeral processions, hospitals, etc. mistakes or not, blown up by bombing, drone attacks, etc. And just plain “collateral damage” in general.

“We came to the realization that the innocent civilians we were killing only fueled the feelings of hatred that ignited terrorism and groups like ISIS, while also serving as a fundamental recruitment tool similar to Guantanamo Bay. This administration and its predecessors have built a drone program that is one of the most devastating driving forces for terrorism and destabilization around the world.”… Exclusive: Air Force Whistleblowers Risk Prosecution to Warn Drone War Kills Civilians, Fuels Terror | Democracy Now!

I don’t want to shock you, but a whole lot of folks think Uncle Sam is the terrorist.

Here’s a recent example:

“Today, Obama will arrive in the Philippines, and this is our welcome for him — a protest that rejects his presence because we do not want the leader of the United States, the chief architect of aggression and cruelty toward many nations around the world, to land in the Philippines.” –Diego Torres

Here’s what finally convinced me – – –

Now, although U.S. officials might think half-a-million dead kids “in pursuit of U.S. Policy” is OK, you can understand why it might seriously tick other people off. Those kids’ parents, family, and friends, for example. Maybe their countrymen in general. Maybe most folks of good will everywhere. It might even tick you off – – –

And even if Uncle stops behaving this way immediately, there will be a time-lag because, by killing their kids, relatives, friends, neighbors, etc., Uncle has ticked-off a LOT of folks over the decades. So you might want to buy that new Glock you’ve been eying — and spend a little more time at the range – – –

This is a burden that will also fall on the kids, grand kids and the yet unborn. None the less, the way to stop terrorism eventually is to stop Uncle Sam from being a terrorist NOW!

I didn’t say it would be easy.

would have seemed insensitive. I knew that, back home in New Jersey,

elderly people such as they were prime targets for muggers and burglars.

Who was I to begrudge them whatever small pleasure they might glean

from strolling Red Square unmolested, under the watchful gaze of

gray-uniformed militsionyeri?

Yet

I wondered how deep their admiration for Brezhnev’s police state

really went. Did those dreamy looks on their faces mean they actually

preferred Soviet dictatorship to our own system? I tried not to

think about it.

That

chance encounter in Moscow returned to haunt me later, when I stumbled

across two disheartening statistics. The first were nationwide poll

results showing that 83 percent of African Americans would support

a ban on all gun sales, except by special police permit. The second

came from a Department of Housing and Urban Development survey of

public housing residents, indicating that 68 percent believed that

allowing police to conduct random searches for guns, without warrants,

would improve safety in their projects.

Like

those elderly tourists in Moscow, black Americans are clearly fed

up with crime. And who can blame them? Fully 50 percent of all murder

victims in the U.S. are black. But, like those short-sighted tourists,

many African Americans appear dangerously willing to tolerate police-state

tactics, in exchange for safer streets.

An

authoritarian crackdown might well succeed in curbing crime. Did

not Mussolini get the trains running on time? But African Americans

would be nave to expect our government to continue working in their

best interests, once it has stripped them of their liberties.

The

Slippery Slope

The

Clinton Administration lured many black civil rights leaders into

supporting the anti-gun movement. But some have declined to jump

on the bandwagon.

Niger

Innis is one (first name pronounced Nigh-jer). Growing up in Harlem,

Innis lost two brothers to gun-wielding killers. But these tragedies

only deepened his conviction that an armed and vigilant citizenry

is the best curb on lawlessness.

“Not

every cop can be everywhere at all times,” says Innis, who is national

spokesman for the New York-based Congress of Racial Equality (CORE).

“Decent men and women with families need to be able to defend themselves

and their property. It’s that simple.”

More

to the point, Innis sees gun control as a slippery slope toward

outright gun confiscation. Loss of Second Amendment rights, he says,

would leave both whites and blacks vulnerable to tyranny.

Disarmed

and Disenfranchised

“Traditionally,

when governments want to disenfranchise people, the first thing

they do is disarm them,” says Innis. “That was the case in Nazi

Germany, when the Jews were disarmed. That was the case in the American

South, after slavery.”

Innis

is correct, on both counts. On November 7, 1938, a 17-year-old Jewish

refugee named Herschel Grynszpan shot and killed a German diplomat

in Paris. The highly publicized shooting gave the Nazis the excuse

they needed for a major crackdown.

German

newspapers whipped up hysteria over the threat of Jewish terrorism.

Then, on November 11, the Nazi government ordered Jews to surrender

all firearms, clubs and knives. Without weapons, the Jews were easily

herded into concentration camps.

Southern

slaveowners also understood the need to keep their victims helpless

and unarmed, as gun-law expert Stephen P. Halbrook documents in

his book That

Every Man Be Armed.

“No

slave shall go armed with a gun, or shall keep such weapons,” declared

an 1854 law of North Carolina. Violators received 39 lashes.

After

the Civil War, many white southerners feared that black freedmen

would take bloody vengeance on their former masters. Fears of a

black uprising were particularly intense in Alabama, Florida, Georgia,

Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina, where blacks outnumbered

whites.

White

southerners responded by creating a race-based caste system — a

U.S. version of apartheid. Gun control was crucial to making it

work. Southern whites tried to maintain their antebellum monopoly

over firearms. Many states barred African Americans from owning

guns.

Local

police, state militias and Ku Klux Klansmen rode from house to house,

demanding that blacks turn in their weapons. Once disarmed, they

were helpless against lynch mobs.

“Before

these midnight marauders made attacks upon peaceful citizens,” Representative

Benjamin F. Butler of Massachusetts informed the U.S. Congress in

1871, “there were many instances in the South where the sheriff

of the county had preceded them and taken away the arms of their

victims.”

On

the other hand, freedmen who kept their guns were able to fight

back. Representative Butler described an incident in which armed

blacks successfully resisted a Klan attack.

“The

colored men then fired on the Ku Klux, and killed their leader or

captain right there on the steps of the colored men’s house….

There he remained until morning when he was identified, and proved

to be ‘Pat Inman,’ a constable and deputy sheriff….”

Controlling

Blacks

According

to Halbrook, the Fourteenth Amendment temporarily stymied the gun-control

efforts of southern whites. It forbade the states from passing any

law that would deprive citizens of their constitutional rights,

including the right to keep and bear arms.

But

in the 1960s, fear of armed blacks soon got the ball rolling again.

Race riots spread from city to city. The Black Panther Party urged

African Americans to arm themselves for revolution.

The

response from white America was swift and predictable. As liberal

anti-gun crusader Robert Sherrill put it, in his 1973 book The

Saturday Night Special, “The Gun Control Act of 1968 was

passed not to control guns but to control blacks….”

In

their fear of black unrest, white Americans had given birth to a

Frankenstein’s monster. The machinery of gun control set up in the

1960s is now being turned against its creators  a case of “the

chickens coming home to roost,” as Malcolm X would have put it.

Warrantless

Searches

A

glimpse of what may lie in store for white America can be seen in

some of the extreme measures that have already been used against

blacks.

In

the early ’90s, some cities experimented with “sweeps” of public

housing projects, in which police, without warrants, would systematically

enter and search every apartment for weapons. Bill Clinton praised

the program, urging its adoption nationwide.

Project

residents were divided in their opinions about the sweeps. Referring

to Chicago Housing Authority chairman Vince Lane, who spearheaded

the program in that city, one tenant told the Chicago Sun-Times:

“He’s using the Southern, Jim Crow, Ku Klux Klan method on his own

people.”

Other

residents declared themselves more than willing to give up their

rights, if it would bring peace. “Sometimes you got to sacrifice

your rights to save your life,” Daisy Bradford told the New York

Times. “As far as I’m concerned, the Constitution needs to be

changed. The innocent people are being violated by the criminals.”

A

federal judge struck down warrantless sweeps in 1995, calling them

a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment. But in view of their

popularity among public-housing residents, it seems only a matter

of time before some pretext is found to bring them back.

The

Civil Right No One Talks About

Niger

Innis believes that blacks are being hoodwinked by their leaders.

“The

Jesse Jacksons and the NAACPs are mouthpieces of the liberal establishment

and the gun prohibitionist crowd, ” he charges. “They are not serving

their constituents within the black community. They’re serving their

masters within the liberal Democratic party.”

According

to Innis, the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental freedom.

Yet, of all the major civil rights organizations, CORE is the only

one defending it.

“My

father [CORE national chairman Roy Innis] is a lifetime member and

a board member of the National Rifle Association,” says Innis. “We

and the NRA are kindred souls, when it comes to the Second Amendment.”

Good

Samaritan

In

1990, CORE defended Kenneth Mendoza, a 19-year-old Hispanic resident

of East Harlem hailed in the press as a “Good Samaritan.” Mendoza

had rescued his pregnant neighbor from a knife-wielding intruder.

The

woman called Mendoza her hero. But, after gunning down the assailant

with a .38 pistol, Mendoza was charged with murder and possession

of an unlicensed weapon. CORE general counsel Mel A. Sachs managed

to get both charges dismissed.

“No

other civil rights organizations have spoken in defense of Good

Samaritans,” Sachs laments. Yet, about 80 percent of Good Samaritans

are minorities, he observes. CORE routinely defends such cases in

court.

Shortly

after Mendoza’s arrest, the New York Times interviewed the

“Good Samaritan’s” neighbors, finding strong support for Mendoza’s

action. “There is a code of law we live by in this neighborhood:

people have to survive,” said Ralph Vello, 25. “He did the right

thing.”

An

Ancient Right

The

code to which Vello referred is not unique to East Harlem. It is

a timeless principle, enshrined in common law: the right to self-defense.

Since

ancient times, society has recognized the right of free men to arm

themselves, in defense of their lives, homes and families. Slaves,

however, were often denied this right. Under the laws of William

the Conqueror, the difference between free men and slaves was actually

defined by ownership  or non-ownership  of weapons.

“If

any person is willing to enfranchise his slave,” said the Norman

law code, “let him…deliver him free arms, to wit, a lance and

a sword; thereupon he is a free man.”

Innis

believes that black Americans have an intuitive grasp of the link

between guns and freedom, an understanding that will eventually

force them to part ways with the Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson crowd.

Referring

to public housing tenants such as Daisy Bradford, who have supported

warrantless sweeps, Innis remarks, “People in a housing project

that is under siege might not care about an esoteric right, like

the right not to be searched without a warrant.

“But

those individuals damn well know what the right of self-defense

is. And they know the power of having a gun on the premises.

“I’ll

bet if we were to go into that project right now, there would be

many law-abiding, decent citizens that have guns in their households,

and they are branded as criminals because of unfair gun laws. Those

people in that project have a desire to protect themselves more

than anybody else. And they’ll do it by any means necessary.”

History

Will Judge

Speaking

in defense of gun sweeps, back in 1994, Bill Clinton dismissed the

charge that warrantless searches violated people’s freedom. “The

most important freedom we have in this country is the freedom from

fear,” he declared before the tenants of a violence-plagued Chicago

housing project.

Clinton’s

words got a respectful hearing from those shell-shocked tenants.

But our founding fathers would have seen right through them.

“Those

who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary

safety deserve neither liberty nor safety,” chided Benjamin Franklin.

In

the end, history will judge whether our generation cared more about

saving its freedom or saving its skin. Should we manage to retain

any semblance of our constitutional liberties, it will be thanks

to the courage of men such as Roy and Niger Innis, who dared to

speak out when all around them were silent.

216745,"Stop

giving money to bums! Before I get dragged off to a sensitivity

reeducation camp, give me a chance to defend that imperative statement.

First, when I say bums I mean able-bodied people who ask

you for money, not because they're in a pickle but because they

have less than you do. (Which is not to say that you should

give money to the other varieties of beggar, but that's a whole

different question.)

When

I first moved to New York, I was appalled by the myopia of these

bums, particularly the showered and glib ones. Why didn't they get

their act together and get a real job, which they obviously had

the physical ability to hold? But then I started estimating

the actual revenue these guys pulled in, and on a busy subway ride

we're talking easily an average of $$1 for a five minute routine  walk

in, say, ""Excuse me ladies and gentlemen, sorry to bother you

but…"" and walk to the next car, holding out a hat or some other

appropriate receptacle. Now that doesn't sound so hot, does it?

Poor fellow; he has to suffer the indignity of asking for a measly

$$1. When someone starts the ball rolling he'll get $$3 or $$4, but

often he'll go away empty-handed, his head bowed in shameful rejection.

There but for the grace of God go I.

Huh?

""You do the math,"" as they like to say. His earnings work

out to $$12 an hour, but they're under the table, so it's more like

the equivalent of an $$18/hour job. The bum is his own boss, he can

set his own hours, he doesn't need to wear a tie  in fact, he doesn't

need a change of clothes at all for work, he complies with

few government regulations (occasionally cops might hassle him),

and he can match any corporate suit with a laptop by doing his job

on the subway. Here I thought I was being productive

by reading a stuffy econ book, while the cool cat next to me is

just kickin it to the misogynist rhymes of the Notorious B. I. G.

But we're both sitting on our asses, while the true

entrepreneur is hustling sales.

That's

right, sales. If I had the time, I'd organize a bum cartel, eliminating

wasteful competition. I'd perform market research to find the profit

maximizing bum appearance and marketing pitch  you can't be

too dirty, but you can't be too clean, you can't be too unintelligible,

but you can't be Dennis Miller, you have to be polite, and above

all else you have to give some song-and-dance about the short-term

nature of your plight, and what steps you have been and are taking

to get back on your feet. I would interview applicants for my coveted

positions, asking such things as age (20-40 years old is ideal),

whether married with children (you'll get a signing bonus for that),

and your race  with a preference of course for blacks, without

any prodding from the NAACP.

For

some reason, do-gooder whites give more money to black bums than

to u2018equally qualified' white ones. I don't know if it's because

of guilt or fear or condescension or what. But most black subway

patrons  perhaps because they actually know what real poverty is  can

distinguish a legitimately needy person from a fraud. Like the guy

in running pants and snow white Air Nikes telling me he hurt his

back and lost his job just yesterday. Right. And I'm Cyndi Lauper.

Let

me be perfectly clear: I am not criticizing the bums. What the hell

do you expect them to do  go work for minimum wage at the Gap? I

am criticizing these cowards who give them money because

they don't want to deal with the problem, and then pat themselves

on the back for helping ""the poor."" They actually pay

people to ask them for money, and then they wonder why there are

so many u2018needy' people. To paraphrase the late Murray Rothbard,

we can have as many bums as we're willing to pay for. The reason

bums congregate in big cities is that's where their customers are.

Bums don't work in suburbs because they'd go out of business.

Now

my twin sister Bobbi is a pansy liberal type who despises my hard-hearted

economist viewpoint. (She won't even talk to me at family picnics.)

But even she is saddened when people give money to bums. I don't

really follow her, but I think her argument goes something like

this: Just as giving a joint or a bottle of whiskey to a bum would

be doing him a disservice  by merely allowing him to postpone the

day of reckoning when he pulls his life together  so too is it not

really helping someone to give him your spare change. Who loves

their kids more  the parents who keep paying their credit card bills

and let them blow off eight years getting a degree in business,

or the parents who cut them off and tell them to get a job?

Apparently

there was this one young ""African American"" (as Bobbi

called him) boy who rode the subway she took to NYU. Every day,

he would make the same pitiful (in the literal sense) speech, with

genuine tears rolling down his cheeks (every day!), about how he

was raising lunch money for his younger brother and sister. Now

Bobbi wanted to sit this boy down and say, ""Listen. It's terrible

that you're in this plight; I honestly can't even imagine. But what

are your plans? Are you going to do this for the rest of your life,

or are you going to go to church after church, until you find one

that will help you get cleaned up and get a job to support your

family?"" I of course think the kid was full of crap  yeah, I'll

bet he's got a sister and brother at home  but Bobbi is very

trusting. That's a liberal for you.

I

hope the moral is clear, whether you're a realist like me or a bleeding

heart like my sister: Stop giving money to bums!

738369,"It seems that piracy has, as it did a couple centuries ago, surfaced once again near the top of the official ""things to fear"" list. Admittedly, I’m a bit late — as I write, it is being replaced by flu. It’s always important, not just to keep the population in a state of fear, but to keep changing the items to be feared. This way, people will not fix their fear on a particular item, and then relax when that item is no longer reported. The goal is to keep us in a constant state of fear and dependence.

Nonetheless, piracy remains a hot topic today. Piracy on the high seas, of course, has long been a problem faced by merchant vessels. Today, though, the pirates are attacking ships flying the American flag, raising piracy from some minor problem for the rest of the world to a top priority. Such is the way the American mind works. The discussion is mostly limited to a narrow range of opinions — the various ways that the military should be involved in fighting piracy. Not asked is the question of whether the military should fight piracy, or if the task of protecting a vessel properly belongs to the owner of the vessel.

More to the point, we hear very little discussion about just what is wrong with the act of piracy. In their usual overblown hyperbole, the chattering classes tell us that piracy is among the most infamous of crimes, that no punishment less than death is fitting for a pirate — as if piracy were anything more than armed robbery and kidnapping committed in an unusual location. No, our politicians assure us, it is a crime without equal. The Chinese kill pirates with the firing squad.

Now, it might seem odd to raise the question of just what is wrong with being a pirate. After all, it appears obvious that threatening people with weapons (in a non-defensive way), holding people for ransom, and stealing the contents of large vessels is not a particularly nice way to make a living. To us normal folks, this is a perfectly reasonable explanation of the evils of piracy. However, this explanation is not available to our chattering classes, since there is no action involved in piracy which they do not cheer when committed by others.

These chatterers, be they media or politicians, have no complaint against the detention of the crew of a vessel carrying drugs or weapons. These crews might be held for ransom, known as bail, or held without any ransom. Is it worse to hold a man for ransom than to hold him and offer him no means to free himself? Any vessel coming onto shore will have a portion of the value of its cargo taken — we call it duty.

What of the deeper principles at work here? Certainly the chattering classes all agree that property may be taken at will from those who produce wealth, either for redistribution to the poor or for the immediate needs of the gunmen taking the money. If the pirates purchase weapons with the money they have raised, how is this different from the purchase of arms by governments with tax revenues? As far as redistribution to the poor is concerned, no one denies that the inhabitants of Somalia are poorer than Americans. Our own government frequently takes our property by force and sends it to Somalia. Now the Somalis have cut out the middleman and are taking it directly. The only difference would seem to be efficiency.

What’s more, the case for piracy is stronger than the case for redistribution. In by far the vast majority of cases of domestic redistribution, the money is taken from people who did not earn it on the backs of those to whom it is given. As John Perkins has detailed, though, the average American finds himself richer than he otherwise would (all else remaining equal) but for economic and military conquest of foreign lands — Somali’s history being a prime example.

Ah, but you might respond, they only approve of these actions when undertaken by governments, not ordinary mortals like these pirates. This is hard to argue against — certainly the average statist, for instance, speaks of disarming the ordinary mortal while drooling over the thought of bigger and better weapons for the government officials. So this must be the relevant difference. A difficulty remains, though — Somali has no government. It seems undeniable that the statist thinks that the actions undertaken by governments are good things — that is, that the actions themselves are not morally objectionable, and that the outcomes are better than the outcomes available by not taking them. The statist wants money taken from productive citizens and either given to the poor or used to buy weapons. Why should the absence of a government prevent these worthy endeavors from being undertaken? It is one thing to say that, in the presence of a government, private help is not needed in these tasks. It would be a far different thing, and not consistent with the general belief system of the statist, to say that the absence of a state dictates that such things simply shouldn’t be done.

More to the point, just what distinguishes the pirates from a state? Certainly, they are not hired by democratically elected leaders, but there are plenty of recognized states in the world which are not democratic. Some of the oldest states consist of little more than self-appointed kings, so this feature hardly seems important. They seem to exercise little concern about living conditions, and as part of the warlord culture, have no interest in doing anything other than living as parasites off of the other members of society. This certainly is not a distinction — this is the definition of a state. The state is not recognized by other states nor by the UN, but neither type of recognition can be a precondition to statehood without involving logical absurdities. If statehood requires the recognition by existing states, then there can be no first state, and hence no future states. If statehood requires recognition by the UN, which is itself an assembly of states, and whose members are all states, then once again our definition cannot get off the ground, as there would be no states to form the UN to recognize states.

The differences, it seems, are largely cosmetic. If the pirates wore silly white uniforms, had larger weapons, and used different terminology when approaching boats, we would regard them as the Somali Coast Guard. Rather than saying ""we’re pirates, we’re here to steal your stuff and kidnap you"" they would need to say ""we’re the Coast Guard, we’re here to tax your stuff at a rate of 100% and detain you.""

So, it isn’t clear just what objection our chattering classes can make to the actions of the pirates. This serves, of course, not to let the pirates off the hook, but to question what we accept on a daily basis. We would not accept such behavior on the high seas — the last uncivilized frontier, in most people’s minds — yet we accept it in our cities and in our homes. Why do our media talking-heads and politicians harp on the subject so much, though, if they have no objection to what the pirates do? Clearly, it helps to reinforce the impression that the world is a scary, scary place outside the borders of the US. Our government in its current form could not last, I predict, if most Americans had any concept of what the world looks like outside our borders. More importantly, it drives home to the unthinking just how dependent we are on government. After all, it was privateers who held a ship captain hostage and a government who freed him. Never mind the question of how our Navy obtained the funds necessary to buy their boats — or how their jurisdiction extends to the Somali coast. The point is to understand that all good in the world comes from your government, and everything foreign is scary and dangerous — oh, and for good measure, you should realize that you are impotent and unable to fight off any threat, and entirely dependent on your government. This is an important message to drive home.

DIGG THIS

If politicians

do anything well, it is to fan the flames of Chicken Little hysteria.

They have an innate talent for scaring neurotic people who are prone

to believe whatever government tells them about potential threats.

Neither side of the political spectrum is above using propaganda

to gain the upper hand in the cutthroat battle for public consciousness

and votes.

For instance,

according to right-wing neoconservatives, the evil menace plaguing

mankind is hordes of Islamic militants who target civilians and

fly aircraft into buildings. We are told that these terrorist madmen

will descend upon our homeland with weapons of mass destruction,

biological and chemical warheads, and ungodly violence to destroy

Western civilization unless we act preemptively.

On the opposite

side of the political aisle, the big threat to the world is global

warming. The leftists' predictions are just as horrific as the rightists'.

They contend that if mankind continues to pump out carbon dioxide

(CO2), the world will suffer catastrophic flooding, severe droughts,

rising sea levels, lasting hunger, and economic chaos. Some global

warming alarmists actually predict the end of humanity within a

couple of decades.

Both scenarios

pander to the politics of fear. But how accurate are they?

In the struggle

to rid the world of terrorism, the Bush Administration launched

a preemptive strike against Iraq in 2003. Two years later, instead

of being “neutralized,” Iraq has replaced Afghanistan as the most

fertile training ground for the next generation of “professionalized”

terrorist, according to a 2005 report released by the CIA's National

Intelligence Council. NIC Chairman Robert L. Hutchings said Iraq

“is a magnet for international terrorist activity.” In a blowback

of epic proportions, the U.S. government seems to be making enemies

faster than they can kill them.

But how big

of a threat are these terrorists? Do they have a lot of resources

other than fear?

When the Japanese

Imperial fleet launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941,

it assembled the most powerful carrier force and the greatest air

power in the history of naval warfare. During the Cold War, the

world was staring down the barrel of 70,000 nuclear warheads and

two sometimes trigger-happy nations. When the Islamic terrorists

struck the World Trade Center, they had 19 hijackers armed with

plastic knives and box-cutters. This is not to say that terrorists

are impotent or pose no threat, but by historical standards, they

possess far fewer military resources compared to enemies from past

wars.

In the case

of global warming, the apocalyptic claims grow louder and shriller,

especially in California, where Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has

imposed new laws to reduce greenhouse gasses. But the fundamental

assertion that CO2 causes temperatures to rise has no scientific

basis. A number of prominent scientists, including Prof. Ian Clark,

a leading archaeological climatologist from Canada, have pointed

to the analysis of ice core samples that go back more than 600,000

years. All ice core records, including those drilled at the Vostok

site in Antarctica, show that CO2 increases lag after warming spells

by an average of 800 years. This finding suggests that rising temperatures

are responsible for the rise of CO2 levels in the atmosphere, not

the reverse.

In the British

documentary The Great Global Warming Swindle, Prof. Clark asserts,

“You can't say that CO2 can drive climate, it certainly did not

in the past…. CO2 clearly cannot be causing temperature changes,

it is a product of temperature; it's following temperature changes.”

To some extent,

mankind's industrialization of the world must have an effect on

climate. But CO2 is a minor component of the earth's atmosphere

— approximately 0.054 percent. And of that infinitesimal amount,

human-induced CO2 makes up less than 1/20th, depending on the data

source. Many climatologists believe that solar activity, combined

with the activities of cosmic rays and cloud formation, is a more

likely candidate for the cause of the earth's warming. After all,

the sun accounts for 99.8 percent of the solar system's mass. In

fact, NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions recently

reveal that the ice caps near Mars' South Pole have diminished for

the last three summers, along with the heating up of other planets.

The ecological-political

establishment is using normal climatic cycles as evidence that the

world is coming to an end. Interestingly, experts made similar dire

predictions of an impending ice age during the cooling trend from

1940 to 1975.

Whatever direction

politician leaders take the issues of terrorism and global warming,

it is almost assured that they will polarize the public, enrich

the well-connected, increase the authority of government, and do

little to mitigate any so-called crisis.

What if the modern version of society is really nothing more than a sleight of hand designed to fool the masses into becoming little more than government mules, allowed their simple pleasures in exchange for providing the muscle and the money needed to feed the beast?

An increasing number of the mules seem to me to have become disheartened at the difficulty of creating and keeping enough wealth to live the life envisioned in youthful dreams. And correctly so: building lasting wealth is relatively easy when you keep 90%, but nearly impossible when you keep just 40%. And, if the trend now in motion continues in motion, the productive elements will soon be lucky to keep 30%.

While even I cant foresee things getting as bad as they did in Britain in 1974, when the top 750,000 wage earners were slapped with a tax rate of 98%, the steady build toward more regulations, more government, more tariffs, and more taxes in more sectors of the economy will affect a broader swath of the public and, in so doing, weigh even more heavily on the nation.

And it will result in much the same thing experienced by the British at the time  a mass expatriation by the more independent-minded and entrepreneurial types.

(While the audience obviously skews toward the idea of expatriation, it is interesting that a just concluded International Living survey found that some 96% of respondents were now actively considering expatriation.)

The modern version of the world, at least to my eyes, appears to be losing credence with an increasing number of Americans. Simply, the material well-being and little extras that we the people have previously dreamed of are now unaffordable for most  especially now that a willingness to take on an excess of debt is no longer being readily confused with net worth.

For the government, with its switch long rusted on expansion mode, the promises of a better tomorrow must be preserved, if only as an inspirational illusion. Yet, with the hard reality of a collapsing Camelot obvious for all to see, the administration and Congress are now discomforted by the loud chorus of mules braying for more and better fodder. And increasingly by the voices of others, the workers in this economy, who are beginning to chafe in the traces.

Direct Citizen Action:... James Ostrowski Best Price: $$0.57 Buy New $$5.75 (as of 07:50 EST - Details)

Attempting to maintain societal status quo, the government is pursuing fiscal and monetary policies that are anything but status quo, including running trillion-dollar deficits as far as the eye can see. But maintaining the status quo is only going to get harder. Social Security, a time bomb planted by FDR, will run a deficit this year, as opposed to 2017 as recently believed. The deficit is no surprise to anyone, but the accelerating pace of the nations fiscal ruin very much should be.

I was in grade school when John F. Kennedy delivered his signature line, Ask not what your country can do for you, but rather what you can do for your country.

In todays paradigm, millions of Americans demand that the country do more for them than they are willing or able to do for themselves, for many in no small part because they have already been asked to give up so much. At the same time, the government is making increasingly muscular demands that those still able to give, give more.

On both sides of the equation, the government looms large  as you would expect it to in a world where public institutions have become the controlling force in virtually all aspects of life.

But the paradigm is broken, in no small part because a long succession of U.S. governments have habitually made politically easy or expedient choices  in the process squandering the wealth of generations and setting the stage for a serious confrontation between the government mules that have and those that have naught.

Of course, I hope for the best as the country goes through the paradigm shift to whatevers coming next. Yet, because no one can say what the new paradigm will look like  and a lot less or a lot more government are both equally likely  I am simultaneously planning for the worst, including buying hard assets and diversifying internationally.

To fail to do so would be to passively accept the life of a government mule.

As David said, diversifying internationally is one of the most critical things to do right now, for any savvy investor. Discover the 5 best ways of going global in our new report.

374774,"High Calories + High Nutrition + Easy to Grow = Smart Survival Gardening

It’s time to get serious about survival gardening. Too many of us still grow our gardens like we’re hobbyists.

“Mmm… let’s see… I think I’ll plant some jalapeños for salsa, some nice lettuce, and maybe we’ll try peas again…”

There are lots of vegetables that are fun to grow—but they’re not the kind of crops that will sustain you through tough times.

I believe there are three main considerations you should take into account when planning a survival garden: calories, nutrition and ease of growing. Today I’ll take a look at all three and help you think through good options for each.

Compost Everything: Th... David The Good Best Price: $$10.19 Buy New $$11.99 (as of 03:35 EST - Details )

Have you ever tried to fill up on salad? It’s not easy unless you load up on the croutons, dressing, shredded cheese, bacon bits, olives…

Try filling your stomach with plain lettuce. There’s really not much to run on.

A survival garden’s primary focus should be on keeping you and your family filled up and running. Going without enough calories dulls your mind and saps your strength, so plan them in when you grow your garden.

Grains are one of the most common sources of calories; however, they don’t usually make much sense to grow on a small scale due to the large amount of work that goes into harvesting and processing them. There’s also mounting evidence that some grains really aren’t all that good for you (I’m looking at you, wheat!).

Roots are the best options for a survival garden due to their high caloric yield and ease of preparation for the table.

Potatoes are the king of root crops since they’re high calorie, easy to grow, produce good yields and are also decent nutritionally. I’d follow them up with sweet potatoes and turnips. If you have at least a subtropical climate, you can also grow some of the super-productive root crops from the tropics such as cassava and true yams.

Other possibilities include beets, carrots, daikon radishes and rutabagas.

Gardening with Nutrition in Mind

Some of the best sources of nutrition are wild foods such as nettles, berries, nuts and various foraged greens; however, there are quite a few very healthy vegetables worth planting as well.

One of my favorite is kale. Every fall we plant a big bed of kale and other greens, allowing us to eat salads through the winter. Your climate may not allow this luxury; however, if you grow a good round of nutritious vegetables like cabbages and carrots into the fall, they can often be stored for a decent portion of the winter. (All winter, if you ferment the cabbage into sauerkraut!).

In your survival garden, just skip the lettuce and go for health-packed vegetables like turnip greens, beets and broccoli. Onions and garlic are both nutritious and medicinal, so plan some of those in—plus, don’t forget the herbs! Rosemary, oregano, mint, parsley—these are nutrient-dense and healing.

Gardening with Ease of Growing in Mind

Some plants are too picky to be worth considering in a serious survival garden. This is going to vary according to your climate, the quality of your soil and the cultivars you select.

For example, I had good luck growing tomatoes in Tennessee clay, allowing my wife and I to jar tomato sauce for the pantry. In my home state of Florida, tomatoes aren’t worth the trouble.

Likewise, you may find carrots to be poor yielders in your garden. Or maybe you can’t get a good head of garlic to set.

If that’s the case, I give you permission to quit growing those problem vegetables and grow something else.

Picking plants the grow with little care is a good idea. If the power goes out, would your garden die in a few days without water because you’ve got a bunch of picky plants? Do you really want to be hauling buckets over to your prize head lettuces every morning?

Go for the scrappy staples that will tough out adverse conditions and ditch the silly stuff. Grow whatever high-calorie and high-nutrition plants you can grow with the least amount of work.

Conclusion

In my gardens I grow lots of sweet potatoes, true yams, cassava, kale, cabbages and mulberries.

These plants just do really well and I can rely on them. I can’t trust eggplant (plus it’s not really a nutritional powerhouse or high-calorie crop), corn, white potatoes or dry beans to do well in my climate, so I limit their growing space and concentrate on the easy stuff. You can do the same. If you feel like a failure with certain crops, move on and grow the stuff that works. I know you may be emotionally attached to giant bell peppers or spotted chick peas or reticulated snake roots…. but let them go if they’re not working.

A survival garden is a food factory, not a hobby—and I don’t know about you, but I’d rather have a full plate of homegrown calories and nutrition than have to live on freeze-dried string cheese, gastric pain-inducing raviolis and cardboard-flavored apple pie substitute from a survival food company.

Plan your survival garden right and you’ll stay full and healthy no matter what happens.

739603,"The U.S. bipartisan governing elite’s fingerprints are on the detonators of those Boston bombs

While the Tsarnev brothers apparently conducted the Marathon bombings in Boston, the detonators of those bombs also have the fingerprints of most Democratic and Republican politicians all over them, and those men and women are in a measure responsible for each and every one of the Boston casualties. Why? Because once again it is blatantly obvious from the evidence the authorities have presented to date that the attackers were motivated by what the U.S. government does in the Muslim world and not because of our freedoms, liberties, and gender equality. So before President Obama and Secretary Kerry, Senators McCain and Graham, and most of the mainstream media swing into intense lying mode – which amounts to “those murderous Muslims are crazy and hate liberty” – here are several contact points with reality worth keeping in mind

1.) To the best of my knowledge, since Osama bin Laden declared war on America in 1996 no Islamist attacker or would-be attacker in the West has ever told the authorities after his arrest that he was motivated to attack by the West’s values, lifestyles, and freedoms. In addition, none of the recovered documents or taped statements by domestic Islamist attackers who died in action have yielded evidence of that kind of motivation. This sort of evidence consistently has shown that the attackers’ overarching motivation to be hatred for U.S. and Western foreign policy toward and intervention in the Islamic world.

2.) Likewise, no major Sunni Islamist leader has preached jihad against the United States and the West because of its values, lifestyle, etc. That they loathe many parts of what has become the West’s semi-pagan society is clear; secular democracy and feminism are not coming to their precincts anytime soon, even if Obama, McCain, and Hillary Clinton continue to seek to impose them with bayonets. Nearly to a man, Islamist leaders have unrelentingly sought to focus Muslims on U.S. and Western interventionist policies and actions in the Muslim world. And those leaders have no lack of things to focus Muslim attention on. Since 2011 alone, for example, President Obama and the similarly interventionist NATO leaders have invaded two Muslim countries – Mali and Libya; established a new U.S. military base in Muslim Niger; and are on the verge of intervening in Syria. In addition, they arbitrarily stripped Muslim Sudan of 30-plus percent of its territory and 75-to-80 percent of its oil reserves and gave it to a new and Christian “South Sudan.” To paraphrase what Edmund Burke said about the resistance of American colonials to direct British intervention and taxation, Muslims who would not resist this sort of illegitimate intervention would be fit to be slaves.

3.) On the U.S. and Western side of the equation we find a mindlessness that is startling; productive of dead and wounded Americans; and which increases the power of our Islamist enemies. Given points 1 and 2 above, it is nothing less than amazing that senior U.S. political leaders in both parties and much of the media – as well as their counterparts in Europe – continue to preach that Americans are being attacked because of their lifestyle and freedoms. One would think that someone in the media would ask them to produce the evidence for this contention, which of course they could not do. But no one has asked because these politicians, pundits, and journalists would have to admit that U.S. foreign policy – preeminently our support for the Saudi tyranny and Israel; our invasions of Muslim countries; and our efforts to impose Western political and social views on Muslims and neuter Islam – is the main motivation of our Islamist enemies and that, therefore, U.S. policy has helped to kill and maim military and civilian Americans abroad, as well as in Boston, New York, Arkansas, Fort Hood, Texas, Washington, and the rural fields of Pennsylvania.

4.) U.S. and Western interventionism also is, in may ways, a two-for for Islamist leaders, their groups, and their ability to attract increasing numbers of young man to their banners. For example, we invade Libya and destroy a viciously anti-Islamist regime. Thereby, we assist in the freeing of thousands of Islamist fighters from Libyan prisons, skilled and experienced men who immediately return to the mujahedin; we facilitate the looting of dozens of arsenals – as we did in Egypt and Tunisia – and so we better arm the mujahedin across Africa; and we deliberately destroy a valuable intelligence ally in our war against the Islamists. And all this in the name of a secular democratic movement that surely exists in the deranged-by-feminism brains of Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice but to no considerable extent anywhere in the Arab world.

5.) Just as damaging to the genuine national security interests of the United States and Western Europe is the combination of relentless interventionism and feckless, effeminate war-making. Whether the war was emphatically a necessity – as in Afghanistan – or a criminally whimsical choice – as in Iraq and Mali – the U.S. and its NATO allies always lose. And they lose not because their Islamist enemies are stronger or better armed – they clearly are not – but because the U.S. and the West will not kill the requisite number of the enemy and their supporters, and destroy enough of the foe’s resources and infrastructures, to make our the Islamists know for certain that the bloody game they started – their religious war against the West – is not worth the candle. As a result, we have suffered truly staggering loses in Iraq and Afghanistan, as we will in Mali as the Islamist insurgency there evolves and expands. However much President Obama and the war-boys McCain and Graham dress up the effectiveness and describe the success of the U.S. military in Iraq and Afghanistan, all of the Muslim world – and especially the young male segment of that population – perceives that the much vaunted U.S. military had its ass kicked and is running home chased by Allah’s warriors, just as the Soviets were evicted from Afghanistan in the 1980s. What better recruiting tool could there be than a perceived reality among young Muslims – underpinned by the reality of U.S. withdrawal-without-victory in Iraq and Afghanistan – that the theoretically omni-powerful U.S. military is an organization that is made reliably contemptible because it is deliberately hamstrung by politicians who are more than willing to wail lamentations and cry crocodile tears over U.S. casualties, but are not willing to protect Americans because they cannot face the reality that the one and only thing that counts in war is victory.

6.) So as Boston is cleaned-up and the casualties are buried and tended, all Americans have yet another chance to think about how long they will tolerate a war that Washington refuses to win, while it systematically and knowingly providing much of the motivation for those Islamists intent on killing of Americans. Through its bipartisan truckling to the Saudi and other Gulf tyrannies; its intervention in places like Libya and Syria, where we have no genuine national interest and are helping to put Islamists in power; its willingness to accept U.S. military defeat everywhere; and its unquestioning bipartisan support for Israel and thereby the corruption of U.S. politics by AIPAC and the campaign funds provided by pro-Israel U.S. citizens, Republicans and Democrats are helping to kill Americans, their families, and their children.

7.) There is a story, perhaps apocryphal, that the young George S. Patton – then fighting to defend the U.S. border with Mexico – raised a July 4th toast to America’s independence with the words: “May God bless America, and may He damn all of her enemies.” At that point in his career, Patton surely had Pancho Villa and his raiders in mind as enemies, not the bipartisan political leaders of the United States. Given where we stand today in our losing war against Islamist insurgents and terrorists, Patton, if alive, might well enlarge the compass of his definition of America’s enemies to include recent U.S. presidents, senators, and congressman – and he would be right to do so.

soap Madmen

offers a rare glimpse of the power of corporate advertising. The

promotion of smoking half a century ago by the ""smart""

people of Madison Avenue, who knew the truth, led to countless deaths.

Advertising and its twin, public relations, became a way of deceiving

on a scale imagined by those who had read Freud and applied mass

psychology to anything from cigarettes to politics. Just as the

Marlboro Man was virility itself, so politicians could be branded,

packaged, and sold.

It is 100 days

since Barack Obama was elected president of the United States. The

""Obama brand"" has since been named Advertising Age’s

""marketer

of the year for 2008,"" easily beating Apple. David Fenton

of MoveOn.org describes Obama’s election campaign ""an

institutionalized, mass-level, automated technological community

organizing that has never existed before and is a very, very powerful

force."" Deploying the Internet and a slogan plagiarized from

the Latino union organizer Caesar Chavez — Si se puede!

— ""yes, we can,"" the ""mass-level, automated

technological community"" marketed its brand to victory in a

country desperate to be rid of George W. Bush.

No one knew

what the new brand actually stood for. So accomplished was the advertising

— a record $$75 million was spent on TV commercials alone —

that many Americans actually believed Obama shared their opposition

to Bush’s wars. In fact, he had repeatedly backed Bush’s

warmongering and its congressional funding. Many Americans also

believed he was the heir to Martin Luther King’s legacy of

anti-colonialism. Yet if Obama had a theme at all, apart from the

vacuous ""change you can believe in,"" it was the renewal

of America as a dominant, avaricious bully. ""We will be the

most powerful!"" he declared.

Perhaps the

Obama brand’s most effective advertising was supplied free

of charge by those journalists who, as courtiers in a rapacious

system, promote shining knights. They depoliticized him, spinning

his platitudinous speeches as ""adroit

literary creations, rich, like those doric columns, with allusion""

(Charlotte Higgins, the Guardian). San Francisco Chronicle

columnist Mark Morford wrote

that ""many spiritually advanced people I know identify

Obama as a Lightworker, that rare kind of attuned being who

can actually help usher in a new way of being on the planet.""

In his first

100 days, Obama has excused torture, opposed habeas corpus, and

demanded more secret government. He has kept Bush’s gulag intact

and at least 17,000 prisoners beyond the reach of justice. On April

24, his lawyers won an appeal that ruled Guantanamo prisoners were

not ""persons"" and therefore had no right not to be tortured.

His national intelligence director, Adm. Dennis Blair, says he believes

torture works. One of his senior officials in Latin America is accused

of covering up the torture of an American nun in Guatemala; another

is a Pinochet apologist. As Daniel Ellsberg has pointed out, America

experienced a military coup under Bush, whose secretary of ""defense,""

Robert Gates, along with the same warmaking officials, have been

retained by Obama.

All over the

world, America’s violent assault on innocent people, directly

or by agents, has been stepped up. During the recent massacre in

Gaza, reports Seymour Hersh, ""the Obama team let it be known

that it would not object to the planned resupply of u2018smart bombs’

and other high-tech ordnance that was already flowing to Israel""

and being used to slaughter mostly women and children. In Pakistan,

the number of civilians killed by American missiles called drones

has more than doubled since Obama took office.

In Afghanistan,

the U.S. ""strategy"" of killing Pashtun tribespeople (the

""Taliban"") has been extended by Obama to give the Pentagon

time to build a series of permanent bases right across the devastated

country where, says Secretary Gates, the U.S. military will remain

indefinitely. Obama’s policy, one unchanged since the Cold

War, is to intimidate Russia and China, now an imperial rival. He

is proceeding with Bush’s provocation of placing missiles on

Russia’s western border, lying that they are a counter to Iran,

which he accuses, absurdly, of posing ""a real threat""

to Europe and the U.S. On April 5, in Prague, he made a speech reported

as ""anti-nuclear."" It was nothing of the kind. Under the

Pentagon’s Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) program, the

U.S. is building new ""tactical"" nuclear weapons designed

to blur the distinction between nuclear and conventional war.

Perhaps the

biggest lie — the equivalent of smoking is good for you —

is Obama’s announcement that the U.S. is leaving Iraq, the

country it has reduced to a river of blood. According to unabashed

U.S. Army planners, as many as 70,000 troops will remain ""for

the next 15 to 20 years."" On April 25, his secretary of state,

Hillary Clinton, alluded to this. It is not surprising that the

polls are showing that a growing number of Americans believe they

have been suckered — especially as the nation’s economy

has been entrusted to the same fraudsters who destroyed it. Lawrence

Summers, Obama’s principal economic adviser, is throwing $$3

trillion at the same banks that paid him more than $$8 million last

year, including $$135,000 for one speech. Change you can believe

in.

Much of the

American establishment loathed Bush and Cheney for exposing, and

threatening, the onward march of America’s ""grand design,""

as Henry Kissinger, war criminal and now Obama adviser, calls it.

In advertising terms, Bush was a ""brand collapse,"" whereas

Obama, with his toothpaste-advertisement smile and righteous clichés,

is a godsend. At a stroke, he has seen off serious domestic dissent

to war, and he brings tears to the eyes, from Washington to Whitehall.

He is the BBC’s man, and CNN’s man, and Murdoch’s

man, and Wall Street’s man, and the CIA’s man. The madmen

did well.

733260,"In the well known “Parable of the Sower”, Jesus taught that while sowing the good seeds of God’s Kingdom, it is also necessary to beware the thorns, the weeds and the tares.

These include the stumbling blocks and wrong concepts, often sown by people yielding to our spiritual enemy Satan, which can choke the seeds of truth. But they can do so only if we permit them to.

Sadly today, just like the early Galatian church, believers seem to have been mesmerized or “bewitched” (Galatians 3:1) – blinded even to some of the most basic Christian principles.

Charity, Duty and Social Welfare

Instant Access to Current Spot Prices & Interactive Charts

Many churches have now almost completely ceded their limited but explicitly scriptural responsibilities as a local hub of social welfare for the poor, to the state:

Nor was there anyone among them who lacked; for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold, and laid them at the apostles’ feet; and they distributed to each as anyone had need. – Acts 4:34-35 If any believing man or woman has widows, let them relieve them, and do not let the church be burdened, that it may relieve those who are really widows. – 1 Timothy 5:16

Worse still, most churches – some passively, some very actively – now teach that even basic family obligations have, for the most part, been superseded by government “welfare” programs. At the same time, they actively encourage financial contributions for various church projects.

But Jesus strongly rebuked religious leaders for advocating the financial dishonor of parents, while claiming the money for themselves:

For Moses said, “Honor your father and your mother”; and, “He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.” But you say, “If a man says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban’ (that is, a gift to God), then you no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother – Mark 7:9-13

The New Testament also warns us severely, that failing to uphold personal duty toward family members is to directly oppose the Kingdom of God – even to the point of heresy:

“if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever” – 1 Timothy 5:8

Indeed, in majority Hindu, Moslem, Buddhist, African or other pagan cultures, it is considered unthinkable to abandon elderly parents or family obligations. But in the traditionally Christian West, to be old very often means to be isolated and alone, or else abandoned to institutional care.

Responsibilities toward the young have likewise been abandoned – and with the full support of most churches:

Compulsory, “free” and godless education places young minds in the hands of their captors, while parents as well as children can be fined or arrested should a child fail to attend.

Early sexualisation, political indoctrination, anti-Christian secularism, parental disrespect and the anti-family agenda, are all hallmarks of a system designed to forge “politically correct” cogs in the giant wheels of the state and its corporate allies – not morally responsible individuals.

Behind the broken and tattered facade of “in loco parentis” lies a reality in which mothers – the most qualified teachers of all – are typically forced out to work and pay for the inflated cost of living plus taxation that overall, can approach or exceed 50% of family income.

That can certainly make the option of private or, better still, home education look daunting – but where there is determination and faith, there will always be a way. Speaking to parents, not the bureaucracies of the state, and with a grave word of warning to all others, the Bible says:

Train up a child in the way he should go. And when he is old he will not depart from it. – Proverbs 22:6 “You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.” – Deuteronomy 6:5-7 Jesus called a little child to Him, set him in the midst of them and said… “…whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the sea.” – Matthew 18:2-6

Law and Disorder

It seems that in most areas of life and across almost all denominations, a pattern of misdirected faith – from God’s ordained natural authority to the state – has repeated itself.

That especially includes matters of “law and order”.

In this particular area, churches have so merged and confused the Kingdom of God with the governments of this world, that they are not even aware of their own God-given judicial authority. In fear and servility, church leaders and elders believe that they must simply bow down while the state sits in a place of divine judgment over the people of God.

Indeed, from inception, many Christian organisations are financially founded upon threatening their fellow believers with government court action over copyright on songs, books and recorded messages. Contemporary Christian music, public gatherings, hymns/ choruses, the order of church services, and even media distribution of the Gospel message itself, are all literally enslaved to this system.

But God, through the Apostle Paul, specifically identified this as an “utter failure” – a matter of “shame” – and made clear that looking to agents of the state to judge us, is to look to those who should be “least esteemed” (1 Corinthians 6).

Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints? …If then you have judgments concerning things pertaining to this life, do you appoint those who are least esteemed by the church to judge? I say this to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you, not even one, who will be able to judge between his brethren? But brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers! Now therefore, it is already an utter failure for you that you go to law against one another. Why do you not rather accept wrong? Why do you not rather let yourselves be cheated? No, you yourselves do wrong and cheat, and you do these things to your brethren!

It is true that our liberty in Christ does not mean openly violating the rules and demands of the ungodly – “lest” as Jesus said, “we offend them” (Matthew 17:25-27).

Yet, as if the Corinthian passage did not even exist, churches go far beyond any possible prudent or sacrificial compliance with regulations, “for the Lord’s sake” (1 Peter 2:12-16). Indeed, with great esteem and improper reverence, they publicly glorify the “law enforcement” agents, courts and systems of this world, while preaching near unconditional subservience as if to the arm of God.

War and Destruction

In many churches, members are sent forth not to preach, but to invade distant parts of the world – in the full knowledge that large numbers of “collateral” killings of innocent people are certain. Those who do so are not only justified but publicly honoured, as if they had fulfilled a holy missionary calling.

Yet at God’s invitation, Abraham – the “father of all those who believe” – interceded for the innocent among the guilty of Sodom and Gommorah and in the end, those few did escape:

“Far be it from You to do such a thing as this, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked; far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” So the LORD said, “…I will spare all the place for their sakes” – Genesis 18:25-26

But unlike Abraham and in fact, much more like the disobedient prophet Jonah – who wanted his own nation’s presumed enemies destroyed – many Christians show little concern for the innocent:

Then God …relented from the disaster that He had said He would bring upon them… But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he became angry. …But the LORD said, “Is it right for you to be angry… should I not pity Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred and twenty thousand persons who cannot discern between their right hand and their left—and much livestock?” – Jonah 3, 4

And so Christians today, by placing the violence of government alongside God as a “holy” instrument, have compromised their point of moral reference. For the purpose of discerning the will and internal voice of God, their spiritual truth “filter” is therefore broken, and they are easily deluded.

So deluded in fact, that many were once utterly convinced that US military aggression would lead to a massive Christian conversion of the violated populations. The influential Christian leader Kenneth Copeland for example – who recently met and prayed with both Donald Trump and the head of the Vatican – delivered the following “prophetic” word (or listen here ) shortly after “9/11″:

“And there are going to be multiplied millions upon millions, there’s going to be close to a billion people that have been trapped in that religion, that over the next few months are gonna to come into the kingdom of God.” (cheering) “That’s gonna happen, you watch and see what I’m telling you. Because … I’m telling you Satan’s fat is in the fire, he pushed it over the line, and God has moved, and for over a hundred years the United States has been an instrument of judgment in the hand of God. That’s one of the reasons we’re blessed, amen? …I can tell you this, that thing has come to an end, its over – I’m talking about Islam and every, all that that stands for. That’s over with. Now, God is making His move.” – Kenneth Copeland, Word of Life Christian Center, Honolulu HI, Evening, Dec. 2, 2001

The sad truth however, was underlined recently when Iraqi priest Father Douglas Bazi confirmed to a shocked American audience that in his country, most of the once thriving and free Christian population has either fled or been killed – and their numbers reduced from over two million to around two hundred thousand.

To minister such death and destruction not only to the world but even to fellow believers, is surely a devilish deception. But there is also another reason why – unlike the prophet Agabus to the early church (Acts 11:28) or Joseph to the Pharaoh (Genesis 41) – the public “prophetic” predictions of Christian leaders today are either so ambiguous, conditional or generalised as to be unverifiable, or else all too verifiably false.

Some may have a genuine and – in other ways – beneficial ministry calling. But outside of a relatively few followers, not one is widely recognised as a prophet. There is a very good scriptural reason for this:

Church, State and Gender

Let your women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but they are to be submissive, as the law also says [see Numbers 30]… for it is shameful for women to speak in church. Or did the word of God come originally from you? Or was it you only that it reached? If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord. But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant. Therefore, brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues. Let all things be done decently and in order. – 1 Corinthians 14:29-40

The New King James Version, in a side note confirms that here, the word “ignorant” is also translated, “without recognition“. It also means, “not known“. In other words:

“your women… are not permitted to speak; but they are to be submissive… if anyone does not recognise (know) this, let him not be recognised (known)“

Note that the context for this passage is set out earlier in verse 23: “when the whole church comes together“. It is therefore not referring to meetings of women, young people or children and certainly not private conversations; but rather to the presence of all – including husbands, with their fellow heads of household.

This is not a matter of male “oppression” or contempt, but of natural leadership. In fact, in any kind of meeting, remaining “silent” is a basic principle of submission to and respect for it’s leadership, which can also apply to men:

In a boardroom, a male employee would never publicly interrupt, instruct, or rebuke the directors.

Nor should a child, in a gathering of mothers.

Or a young man, when being advised by his elders.

Or a deacon, in a council of senior church leaders.

Or any church member, while the leader is expounding from the pulpit.

Not long ago – before the rise of the welfare state and of effective artificial birth control – male leadership, protection and provision, along with a woman’s primary calling as a “helper” (Genesis 2:18) and her dependant status as a child bearer, were all generally recognised as simple facts of nature. Most Christian teaching supported this.

In line with these natural gifts, godly women have proven to be invaluable when called to help in many areas of church and ministry:

Miriam the prophetess led the women in procession (Exodus 15:20);

Elizabeth prophesied to Mary (Luke 1:41-58);

Older women are instructed to teach the younger women “ to be discreet, chaste, homemakers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed ” (Titus 2:3-5);

” (Titus 2:3-5); Many women assisted Jesus and supported the apostles of the early church.

However, it is true that in special circumstances, an essential task may temporarily have to take priority over the natural order:

Contrary to nature, God even used a donkey to rebuke the prophet Balaam (2 Peter 2:16).

In a time of great danger, God first used ravens to feed Elijah and then a penniless widow to provide for him (1 Kings 17)

Just as uniquely, the prophetess Deborah did act as a judge in difficult times – yet she plainly informed the man God called to lead, that it was a disgrace to be guided by a woman (Judges 4:8-9).

And many godly women are forced to act as heads of household, for example, when widowed or abandoned.

But when a helper and child-bearer – influenced by false church teaching or today’s trans-sexual culture, and feeling “empowered” by state enforcement agencies – deliberately seeks to assume church or home leadership; she leaves her calling (1 Tim 2:11-3:5).

Let a woman learn in silence with all submission. And I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to be in silence. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression. Nevertheless she will be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control. This is a faithful saying: If a man desires the position of a bishop he desires a good work. A bishop then must be blameless… one who rules his own house well, having his children in submission with all reverence (for if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?)

Whenever female leadership is permitted by church leaders, then the patriarchal order in the Kingdom of God – our Heavenly Father – is directly challenged. To participate in and bow to such “politically correct” state sponsored social disorder is to stand in direct opposition to the natural order ordained by God. It can only be called idolatry.

Taken together with the adulterous teaching commonly used to justify divorce (facilitated by running to government courts or agencies); this means that many otherwise fine churches have become vulnerable to error and false prophets. And their social fabric has been torn apart by fully state approved and documented – but nevertheless adulterous and therefore sexually immoral – relationships that follow from state approved divorce.

“whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery.” – Matthew 19:4 Now to the married I command, yet not I but the Lord: A wife is not to depart from her husband. But even if she does depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband is not to divorce his wife. – 1 Corinthians 7:10-11

In Revelation 2:20, the risen Jesus tied the spiritual root of this problem to a wicked woman called “Jezebel” of the Old Testament. So wicked in fact, that in the end she was eaten by dogs when she would not listen, after being publicly warned of this by a prophet of God (2 Kings 9).

The one weapon the woman Jezebel grasped above all to empower herself was the state. And through manipulation, she gained the upper hand over her weak but equally wicked husband, King Ahab (1 Kings 21:25).

In Revelation 2, her spiritual successor is identified. This woman has the dubious distinction of being the only female church leader in the New Testament. Note that believers are rebuked first of all for allowing this:

“I know your works, love, service, faith, and your patience; and as for your works, the last are more than the first. Nevertheless I have a few things against you, because you allow that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce My servants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols. And I gave her time to repent of her sexual immorality, and she did not repent. Indeed I will cast her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds.”

Breaking Free

It is fair to conclude of Christian churches as a whole, that at all levels – family, church, judicial and business – God-ordained order has been either partially or completely compromised. Church teaching which should present the world changing the Kingdom of God, instead actively undermines natural God-ordained authority by proclaiming, serving and uniting with the government systems of this world.

It is now high time for Christians to break out of these dark spiritual strongholds of the mind: an Earthly government is not the Saviour. It offers no real hope and, in earthly matters as in heavenly matters, it should not be the object of our faith or allegiance in any way.

Instead, we have an eternal allegiance and a far more powerful message of truth to deliver: The wonderful Good News of the Kingdom of God announces our freedom from all oppression in all realms, both spiritual and material.

Above all, it proclaims that true hope is to be found only in the love and sacrifice of our risen, everlasting and only King, the Lord Jesus Christ – and through upholding the natural order and principles of his Kingdom alone.

51546,"On Monday, two threads in New Orleans’ long and sometimes twisted historical tapestry will intersect, giving us one of the most unlikely events of the summer.

It’s a traditional jazz funeral, being held for a woman murdered 50 yeas ago, who, some say, had a mysterious connection to the man who assassinated John F. Kennedy.

Only in New Orleans.

“Mary Sherman was a beautiful, educated, and successful woman, beloved and respected by those who knew her,” says Ed Haslam, whose book about the woman’s murder, “Dr. Mary’s Monkey,” has been something of an Dr. Maryu2019s Monkey:... Edward T. Haslam Best Price: $4.74 Buy New $15.75 (as of 11:45 EST - Details) underground classic for 20 years. “It is time we gave her a better send-off than the vicious rumors that swarmed around her death in 1964. Here in New Orleans, the dignified way to show respect is with a jazz funeral. This is only a ‘faux funeral,’ but the jazz and the respect are real.”

Haslam, a former New Orleanian who now lives in Florida, will be on hand for the jazz funeral. On Monday evening, he will talk about his book and his years of research at “An Evening with Ed Haslam” at the Jefferson Parish library (details below).

Here’s the backstory, as outlined by Haslam in his book. You should dive into the tome itself if the storyline intrigues – and why would it not, with this provocative subtitle: “How the unsolved murder of a doctor, a secret laboratory in New Orleans, and cancer-causing monkey viruses are linked to Lee Harvey Oswald, the JFK assassination and emerging global epidemics.”

Mary Sherman was a brilliant doctor in an era that gave few women access to the upper registers of medicine.

On the morning of July 21, 1964, her badly burned body was discovered in her bedroom in Apartment J of 3101 St. Charles Ave. The 51-year-old widow had been stabbed repeatedly and, according to the autopsy report, half her right side and arm were charred to the point that bone had burned to cinders and her vital organs were exposed. Yet there was minimal fire damage in her apartment.

Rumors surfaced quickly about the gruesome murder. There were whispers of a lesbian lifestyle gone wrong on the one hand, reports of a bold burglary attempt on the other. Contradictions and inconsistencies in both public and police reports followed: the door had been forced; the door had not been forced. Jewelry was stolen; the jewelry box was intact. The fire didn’t spread, but merely smoldered; yet it would have taken a 500-degree conflagration to cause the damage to Sherman’s body.

Maryu2019s Mosaic: The... Peter Janney Best Price: $7.50 Buy New $14.11 (as of 03:00 EST - Details) Haslam spent years researching the woman and the crime, and what he found makes the JFK conspiracy theorists look like amateurs.

According to Haslam’s book, Dr. Sherman worked in a secret Uptown laboratory devoted to mutating viruses in monkeys. Her intent: to find a vaccine for cancer. But a more nefarious purpose was a government-backed plan to create a biological weapon that could be used to kill Fidel Castro.

To that end, believes Haslam, Sherman was involved in work at a second, smaller, even more secret laboratory in the basement of David Ferrie’s home in New Orleans. Ferrie was an ex-pilot who had served in the Civil Air Patrol with Lee Harvey Oswald, and who, along with FBI agent Guy Bannister, was accused by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison of conspiring to assassinate JFK. That story was told by Oliver Stone in the movie JFK.

Sherman’s story, according to Haslam, had more to do with Cuba and Castro. The doctor was pulled into a plan to use her cancer research to develop a lethal virus that could be used on the Cuban dictator. The work involved a high-voltage linear particle accelerator installed clandestinely on the grounds of the old U.S. Public Health Hospital Uptown. The device was used to mutate viruses, which were then injected into mice in Ferrie’s basement. Blood, Money, & Power:... Barr McClellan Best Price: $2.00 Buy New $7.74 (as of 02:40 EST - Details)

Haslam postulates that, on the night in question, there was an accident in the secret lab involving the particle accelerator. The doctor was burned severely. As Haslam conjectures, “The massive electrical current and intense heat literally blew her arm off.” Unable to revive her and desperate to keep their project confidential, her co-conspirators ended her misery with a knife stab to the heart, moved her charred body to her apartment, and faked a murder scene.

Originally published in 1995 as “Mary, Ferrie and the Monkey Virus,” Haslam’s book was released again in 2007 as “Dr. Mary’s Monkey” — with an additional chapter. In contained an interview with Oswald’s self-professed girlfriend, Judyth Vary Baker, who corroborated much of what Haslam had written about Sherman, her clandestine lab research and association with major players in various Kennedy assassination conspiracies. She and JFK and the Unspeakabl... James W. Douglass Check Amazon for Pricing. Oswald, she confided, had been lab assistants at Ferrie’s house.

Now the book is being republished in a hardback addition, with 25 additional pages of new information, original crime scene photos, and documents from the FBI, CIA, CDC and NOPD.

Whether or not you believe Haslam’s theories, his book is diligently researched and annotated, and has all the elements of a good pot-boiler: assassination plots, biological weapons, secret government labs, and a 50-year-old unsolved murder.

In New Orleans, of course, people love a good tale and a good conspiracy, filled with odd characters. Haslam produces them all.

170812,"Over the past 30-40 years modern medicine has steered humanity toward medicines and treatments that are just now being realized as giant self-serving misdirections, all imparted with great fear that failure to adhere to these deceitful therapies will result in severe health consequences.

Here are some examples:

Cholesterol capers

After over four decades of pressing the idea that mortal heart attacks result from the accumulation of cholesterol in coronary arteries that requires the prescription of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, with no evidence that doing so reduces the risk for mortal heart attacks, the American Heart Association is now pressing for expansion of statin drugs to millions more Americans whether they have high cholesterol levels or not.

A revealing study recently published in the European Heart Journal shows that cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure are not predictive of a future mortal heart attack but if a measure of arterial calcification was zero the risk for a mortal heart attack in the next 5 years is one-half of one percent. This is conclusive evidence that calcium, not cholesterol, is the primary cause of the number one cause of death in the U.S. (Nature provides at least five inhibitors of arterial calcification: magnesium, vitamin K2, vitamin D3, fish oil and IP6 rice bran extract.)

New class of cholesterol-lowering drugs

With patents on most statin drugs having expired, Big Pharma is introducing a new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs called PCSK9 blockers that lower cholesterol by 55 to 66 percent. PCSK9 is a substance that interferes with the liver’s ability to remove cholesterol from the blood. This class of drug must be given by injections every 2-4 weeks, which will be another cash-cow for physicians.

News reports say PCSK9 blockers are designed for 70 million Americans “who can’t tolerate or don’t get enough help from statin drugs.” This serves as a tacit admission currently prescribed statin drugs don’t work.

The problem here is that PCSK9 blockers were initially developed for a small number of people who have an inherited cholesterol problem called familial hypercholesterolemia, not the 70 million cited in the news story mentioned above. Only 1 in 500 people worldwide suffer from it.

Besides, it has been known for over a decade that individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia can improve the ability of their arteries to dilate (widen) to control blood pressure and avert heart attacks simply by taking supplemental folic acid (vitamin B9). Simple non-drug remedies are not the forte of Big Pharma or the physician community.

Dr. Duncan Adams of the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand, writes in the Quarterly Journal of Medicine, October 2011, that a similar mistaken direction in understanding inherited cholesterol elevation was used to usher in the era of statin drugs decades ago.

In 1985 Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein won a Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine for their discovery that a defective gene that altered normal cholesterol metabolism. They mistakenly concluded that drugs which would reduce cholesterol production in the liver would reduce the risk for arterial disease and death. However it is actually hydrodynamic damage to arterial walls followed by inflammation that results in arterial disease, not cholesterol per se, says Dr. Adams.

“It is not possible to produce arterial disease by feeding excess amounts of cholesterol to laboratory animals,” says Dr. Adams. He cites a study published in June of 2010 in the Archives of Internal Medicine which showed there is no prolongation of life with use of statin drugs, which Dr. Adams says is the “final nail in the coffin of the great cholesterol myth.”

But it looks like this very same misdirection is going to be repeated again in the interest of creating another billion-dollar category of cholesterol-lowering drugs.

Refined sugar, not fat

Another revelation is that refined sugar consumption can increase the risk for mortality from heart and blood vessel disease by as much as 243%. The consumption of one 20-ounce Mountain Dew soda provide enough refined sugar to increase mortality rates. There is a 40% increased risk for cardiovascular death when individuals consume more than a third of their daily calories from added sugar.

While the World Health Organization has belatedly drawn limits on sugar consumption, the food industry is so firmly entrenched that the head of a panel of health experts in Britain who has commercial ties to candy and soda pop companies has arrogantly said his committee will not act on these new guidelines on sugar intake.

To add to this misdirection, a recently published review of 45 studies involving 600,000 subjects in 18 countries reveals the total amount of saturated fat in the diet or blood stream has no impact on heart health. In fact, one of the drawbacks of backing away from lard in baking and cooking was that it provided ~600 international units of vitamin D per day, a practice that may have impaired the human immune system.

For millions, blood pressure pills no more

Another unapologetic misdirection has been to place millions of Americans on blood pressure pills without factoring for age-related decline in the risk for stroke. Newly updated blood pressure guidelines suggest 5.8 million U.S. adults no longer need to take blood pressure-lowering pills. The new blood pressure goal for adults over age 60 is 150/90 rather than the previous 140/90. Will physicians take their patients off of these drugs?

This has been known since January of 2000 when researchers at the University of California Los Angeles reported an increased risk for dying from stroke or heart attacks isn’t apparent till the number (systolic pressure) reaches 159 for males and 167 for females 65-74 years of age. This foot dragging has put many senior Americans at greater risk for the many side effects from blood pressure drugs than any offsetting health benefit.

More unproven and/or disproven drugs: Tamiflu

No FDA-approved drug has been as deservedly vilified as Tamiflu. Yet the greatest criticism against this drug (that was developed in the 1990s and licensed by the US Food & Drug Administration itself) is coming from overseas reviewers. The British Medical Journal recently dedicated an entire issue to expose the machinations of Big Pharma in the mis-marketing of Tamiflu.

Scientific review now reveals Tamiflu, which aggregately generated over $$18 billion of sales since its inception (most which have never been used), does not inhibit the spread of the flu or decrease the risk for flu-related pneumonia and only cut flu-like symptoms from 7.0 to 6.3 days (16.8 hours), “not enough to justify the huge expense governments have incurred worldwide in stockpiling this drug.”

Assumptions were that Tamiflu would reduce hospital admissions by half and slow the spread of the virus. Tamiflu did not reduce hospitalizations and was not proven to be effective in the highest-risk group – children.

With such ineffectiveness, patients faced a greater risk for side effects than any proposed health benefit from Tamiflu. Side effects include headaches, nausea, vomiting, psychiatric disturbances and kidney problems. These side reactions were not apparent to reviewers because many studies were never even published. The drug companies kept the side effect ratios to themselves.

According to a report published in The British Medical Journal, the FDA, which had full access to the full clinical study reports, eventually concluded that Tamiflu has not been shown to prevent complications such as serious bacterial infections while the Centers for Disease Control came to the exact opposite conclusion – all apparently based upon analysis of the same data.

Despite the failure of Tamiflu, the World Health Organization considers Tamiflu an essential medicine that should be universally available.

Andrew Jack, deputy analysis editor at the British Medical Journal says Tamiflu represents a “classic story of ‘Big Pharma’ greed.”

Tamiflu was posed to save millions of lives. By 2009 96 countries had stockpiled enough Tamiflu for 350 million people worldwide. The drum beat at the time was for a killer strain of the flu that would sweep the globe, but the H1N1 strain proved far less fatal than feared.

Tamiflu is just a grand example of the fraud that pervades the drug industry. It is not a singular exception to the so-called ethical drug industry. The drug companies control the data. It took over four years for reviewers to obtain access to the data on Tamiflu trials. Editors at the British Medical Journal ask: “Why did no one else demand this level of scrutiny before spending such huge sums of money on one drug? And why do we have a system of drug evaluation and regulation that is incapable of providing patients, clinicians and policy makers with timely, reliable and independent information. Indeed, the current system seems to be designed with the opposite end in mind.”

Any embarrassment over the unethical behavior by Big Pharma is not apparent. Just today, as I am writing this report, researchers claim they may have found the “Achilles heel” of the influenza virus and are “one step closer” to developing a drug that will build resistance to the flu. It does so by inhibiting an inflammatory protein called prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2).

Humanity need not wait for an expensive drug to inhibit PGE2. The red wine molecule resveratrol effectively inhibits PGE2 and is widely available as a dietary supplement. Resveratrol actually blocks the replication of flu viruses, regardless of their strain, which is something that the flu vaccine cannot do.

And with all of the fear mongering over the flu, a recent study finds three-quarters of adults who develop seasonal or pandemic flu never even exhibit any symptoms. This suggests massive over-vaccination and overkill by public health authorities.

Modern medicine on parade

A litany of the deceptions of modern medicine could go on ad infinitum.

The arrogance displayed by researchers as they applaud themselves in their get-rich schemes to develop new synthetic drugs is deplorable. Take the example of a recent announcement there is a new concept for the treatment of cancer. The idea is to develop drugs that inhibit a specific enzyme called MTH1. In a report published in a European scientific journal researchers claimed “discovery of the first small-molecule inhibitor of the MTH1 enzyme.”

Yet a quick search for any prior discoveries reveals researchers in 2011 reported that lycopene, the red pigment in tomatoes, “completely inhibited MTH1” in a lab dish study.

The game of Big Pharma is to hide these discoveries and replace them with synthetic molecule that can generate billions in profits.

Once again, recent news headlines claim an “astonishing new cancer drug could extend the lives of terminally-ill patients and eliminate their symptoms overnight… with virtually no side effects.” The drug responsible for this news headline is an enzyme inhibitor. The drug inhibits an enzyme called Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase. Until that drug becomes a reality, desperate cancer patients might resveratrol, the red wine molecule that inhibits tyrosine kinase enzymes.

There is no shame in modern medicine, just plundering of public and insurance funds. The public will get what Big Pharma and physicians deem is good for them, not the public.

226674,"On Friday, January 30, as an unwelcome surprise to both of us, my husband, Mr. Comic Mom, was laid off. Three weeks and over 100 résumés later, he had two job offers. Although he has not yet found a so-called permanent job — although, really, all jobs are temporary — he is making more money than he did, at a job that’s been promised to him through the end of September. The weekend after his layoff, he was already polishing his résumé. That Monday, I became his manager, his job bitch, as I deemed myself, making sure that he sent the requisite ten résumés each day and helping him to make sure that his résumé is close to perfect. Before the end of February, his efforts had paid off and he had gained employment. Granted, there was luck involved in this endeavor, but also a lot of hard work. The efforts of our entire family centered around our main breadwinner’s ability to continue to buy bread. Although education and experience don’t always ensure a good job, my husband has amassed both and his résumé is a fabulous one. He was not born with any silver spoons shoved into his mouth, however, nor was I, and we’ve both worked hard for any success that we have.

Evidently, his success at finding a job so quickly in a crappy economy makes him one of those evil capitalists, the kind that folks who write for the statist Los Angeles Times seem to loathe. Specifically, I found out recently that we made the wrong move by working so hard to employ him so that he and I and our three young sons can eat and have a roof to sleep under at night. It would have been better, according to Times’ darling Barbara Ehrenreich, author of the rather depressing titles, Bait and Switch: The (Futile) Pursuit of the American Dream and Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America, if we’d become poor.

Funny how just last night, I was telling Mr. Comic Mom about Karen De Coster’s excellent article, ""A Nation of Helpless Idiots,"" and then today, I learned that we are not helpless enough, according to Ehrenreich. We had both laughed last night about how, despite De Coster’s excellent and insightful writing, the Times would probably never publish her writing. I don’t know why we laughed about this strangeness; it’s not that funny when you think of how undiverse the Times is, but then again, when I’m dealing with the statist propaganda of the Times, I have to laugh or else I’d tear the paper to shreds in anger.

So, how did we nasty capitalists screw up by attempting to provide for our family? According to Ehrenreich, it is not progressive thinking to look at finding a job as a job in and of itself. In fact, her article is indeed titled: ""Trying to Find A Job is Not A Job."" We should have been community organizing something; we should have been angry and petitioned our rulers; we should have been demanding that Emperor Obama give us free health care. Mr. Comic Mom wanted to receive unemployment benefits instead of a paycheck about as much as he wanted to stand in line at a soup kitchen instead of sitting at our table with our own food.

In most parts of the world, from Paris to Beijing, mass unemployment brings the specter of mass social unrest. Not here, though, where 13 million people have accepted joblessness with nary a peep of protest.

Yep, that’s us. Mr. Comic Mom was one of the 13 million people who was too busy trying to feed his family to waste time carrying signs that protest . . . what? Well, we should have been protesting something instead of sending those résumés. Ehrenreich’s supposedly progressive attitude would have had us joining ""one of the emerging efforts to organize the unemployed, like Food AND Medicine in Maine, the Unemployed and Anxiously Employed Workers’ Assn. of Allen County, Ind., or the nationwide group United Professionals,"" the latter of which was started by none other than Ehrenreich herself. Instead of sitting down to a healthy dinner at the Gingerbread House, we should have ""[pitched] in with one of the several organizations fighting for single-payer health insurance, or at least a huge expansion of public health insurance for the unemployed."" Instead of planning and working toward finding a job, we should have taken unemployment benefits for as long as possible and banded ""together with laid-off friends and co-workers to discuss how [we] would design an economy that [makes] use of people’s precious skills instead of periodically tossing them out like so much trash."" I know; I know. We are capitalists and as such, we are awfully, awfully selfish.

Nowhere in the article does Ehrenreich discuss how this whole single-payer health insurance thing is to be funded; nor does she have much faith in people’s ability to be creative and make money without the government’s help. She seems also to skip over any information about how governmental regulations and economic manipulation by the Federal Reserve may have resulted in this economic mess. No, it’s much easier to tout socialism as a solution to all our problems. And in a world in which Emperor Obama is worshipped by almost everyone, why let nasty old outdated capitalism get in the way?

As a result of Mr. Comic Mom’s new job, we can now stimulate the economy without using a dab of governmental assistance. We were able to pay a comic friend of mine, whose day job of a landscaping business was slow, to do some major yard work. If Mr. Comic Mom’s job continues to work out, we’ll pay my friend more to help us redesign our front yard. We were also able to pay for some electrical work that gave us a safer and more beautiful home. And we hope soon to pay for a badly needed sliding door at the Gingerbread House. Ah, but these are capitalistic things that we pay for with money that Mr. Comic Mom has earned. As everybody in Obamaland knows, we should instead be applying for some kind of governmental grant.

It’s hard to find an article in the Times these days that doesn’t praise the Emperor who has no clothes. Even an article about Yusuf, the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens, reveals that years of supposed enlightenment lead to believing that the Emperor does have clothes:

""I wanted to sing out,"" said the artist regarding his reentry into the music business, ""for a more peaceful world again and looking at it, it’s still very bad and we’ve got to do something to change that. But already, the fact that America has a dynamic new president — who happens to be a black man and who happens to have a middle name of Hussein — has said that the world can change . . . It’s great.""

And isn’t it, though? The world is changing so much because we no longer have a nasty white guy as Emperor. The world may indeed seem more peaceful despite the fact that Emperor O. seems to like to kill people in other countries just as much as his predecessor, King Jorge. There’s been no end to any war that I know of in Emperor O.’s first 100 days. But that’s okay. Those folks who are dying are on the other side of the world, aren’t they? So, they don’t really count. And really, isn’t it more important that we raise a ruckus about giving everybody supposedly free health care than worry about the people whom our tax dollars help to kill?

After all, if we don’t look very closely, it almost seems as though the new Emperor does have clothes. We should forget about our own selfish desires to provide for our family and trust Emperor O. to provide for us. We should all stop driving our cars and ride on the socialist bandwagon. We should protest and complain about something instead of looking for a job. After all, isn’t that what Jesus Obama would do? Come on now; I can almost hear everybody singing Kum Ba Yah.

737974,"James A. Marusek, nuclear physicist and engineer, presents a clear and easily understood paper (9 Mar 2004), on the Internet, that debunks global warming theory as presently accepted. It is my opinion that many competent and honest scientists agree with him but competent and honest scientists have a hard time being heard.

He understands that the earth is living within an Ice Age, (1—2 million years) in which it experiences Global Cooling Events every 1,000 to 1,500 years. Ice cores have demonstrated this. The theory refers to these events as ""extinction boundaries,"" periods in which cosmic rays from supernova produce short intense periods of radiation at the planet’s surface followed by long, less intense periods (hundreds of years). After it passes this phase our Earth will experience a long period of calm (maybe 80 million years) in which life will flourish better than it has in the past. Then as our solar system passes through a spiral arm of the Milky Way we will experience another ""extinction boundary."" This theory is accepted by astronomers and is the basis for his discussion.

He suggests that modern Global Warming theory is only a few decades old, that billions have been spent without turning up a strong support for it and evidence has been building up to reject it. It has been taken over by antihuman ideologists and politicians and made into a fear-based religious belief. In true science, evidence is found that supports theories; this one is no longer scientific at all. The Earth is presently experiencing a warming trend caused by a supernova, and we are coming out of the Little Ice Age that began in the early 1300’s.

The theory states that mankind has caused carbon dioxide levels to rise, which raises global temperatures uncontrollably. The increase in carbon dioxide is true but the fact that water evaporates, rising above the carbon dioxide and releasing heat into space is ignored.

Carl Sagan theorized that the elevated temperature of Venus (850 degrees) was brought about by a runaway global warming process and suggested this is happening here. He assumed that the sunlight on Venus was trapped by the atmosphere of the planet and ignored the fact that the energy heating that planet’s atmosphere includes radiated thermal energy released from the planetu2018s interior. The elevated temperature on Venus is not due solely to solar radiation but also to magma-released heat. The carbon dioxide level on Venus is 96.5%. On Earth it has risen from 0.028% to 0.036%. It is a real stretch to compare the Earth with Venus.

Another element focuses on the destruction of forests and pollution from factories and automobiles. To understand this one must realize that forest acreage has been expanding and pollution levels have been declining, particularly in North America. And much of carbon dioxide action takes place in the oceans.

385 million years ago Earth had an atmosphere with 10 times the present carbon dioxide levels. Those elevated levels did not produce runaway global warming then; there is no reason to assume they would do so today. Plant life thrives under enriched carbon dioxide levels and is responding to this increase.

To summarize, a strong link between carbon dioxide levels and global temperatures has not been established, the idea of runaway warming is not supported, comparing us to the planet Venus is inappropriate, the impact of the oceans has not been investigated adequately, forests are growing and pollution is coming under control. Global warming (climate change) is natural, is not caused by man, and is something to be lived with.

457727,"Previously by James Howard Kunstler: Financial Crisis Called Off

George W. Bush was onto something in the fall of 2008 when he remarked apropos of the Lehman collapse:  this sucker could go down.

Its my serene conviction, by the way, that this sucker actually is going down, right now, even as I clatter away at the keys  perhaps in slow motion, so that not many other bystanders have noticed yet, and the few who have noticed are mostly too cross-eyed with nausea to speak.

Its perhaps useful to define even what we mean when we say this sucker. Everybody knows what a sucker is, of course  say, a Midwestern public employees union pension fund snookered into buying a fat slice of equity tranche in a Goldman Sachs–engineered CDO. But this sucker is something else: a rather large cargo of commercial relations, entailed obligations, hopes, expectations, habits of daily life  indeed millions of whole lives  loaded onto the rather creaky vessel we call modern civilization. This sucker was such an apt term coming from someone whose understanding of civilization was like unto that of a boy who found a PlayStation under the Christmas tree.

Its also perhaps useful to define what we mean by going down. To my mind it means an awful lot of money disappears and nobody can pay for anything and an awful lot of things that have kept going on promises to pay and to get paid will stop keeping going. I dont think that the idea of money disappears  that is, paper certificates representing claims on future work  but there will be a lot less of it to go around. Eventually the idea of money could go, too, at least in its current form as Federal Reserve notes. But mostly for some years it will just be a lot of people, companies, and governments who are broke.

Going down will mean a society with no money and an infrastructure for daily life that requires gobs of money to run, and a populace too dazed, confused, and inflamed to do anything useful in the way of organizing new infrastructures for daily life for their new circumstances. In retrospect, the Great Depression of the 1930s will look like The Philadelphia Story compared to what we wake up to ten years from now.

President Obamas speech at Cooper Union last week was a remarkable performance. It managed to appear forceful and serious without containing any really serious or forceful proposals to discipline a banking system that is running a hostage-and-ransom racket on civilization. If this is finally what the Obama Experience is all about than his detractors have been right all along: he is a tool. Finance reform aside, there are still plenty of laws left on the statute books that could be applied to the frauds and rackets that ran absolutely amok on Wall Street the past few years. I would still like to know why buying CDS insurance against your own issue of bonds deliberately engineered to default is NOT a form of insider trading, to put it as simply as possible.

The SEC action against Goldman Sachs is likely to open a Pandoras box of troubles for that company, and perhaps all of the Too Big To Fail banks. But even so, I believe this sucker is going down before 99.9 percent of it is sorted out. Anyway, there was a lot about the SEC action that seemed curious, to put it mildly, from the timing of it, to the brevity of the document, to the strange fact that it emerged at all from an agency whose principal activity the past few years has been the viewing of internet porn, and which has otherwise behaved so indifferently in the face of numberless offenses to common decency, not to mention the public interest, that it might as well have been staffed by a thousand head of Holstein cows rather than licensed attorneys and graduates of accredited colleges.

This sucker is going down because the train of bankruptcies underway has a remorseless self-reinforcing power to provoke more and more bankruptcies at every stop along the line as every promise to pay is welshed on. The mortgages will not be paid and securities will not pay their investors and the banks will choke on the bad paper promises in their vaults and the pension funds will not pay their beneficiaries and the states and counties and municipalities will go broke and not pay their employees and creditors, and the federal government will not be able to print new money in sufficient quantities fast enough to compensate for all the money not being paid up-and-down the line and one morning we will wake up and discover that all those promises to pay were sham promises based on no productive activity whatsoever and that will be a sad day. Perhaps the Dow Jones Industrial Average will hit 35,000 on that day.

Nothing can stop this chain of bankruptcy. Its already baked in the cake. There is probably some wish on the part of those in charge, like Mr. Obama, to try everything possible to postpone it. And there is likewise surely a huge effort underway in the banking sector right now to cream off as much cash as possible so that when this sucker does go down they will bethink themselves better positioned to survive the consequences.

Personally, I believe that the damage was mostly done during the tenure of poor dim George W. Bush, and his predecessor Bill Clinton. I suspect that Mr. Obama learned at the height of 2008 election campaign  during those days of the Lehman collapse and the TARP  just how completely the government  and the people of the USA  were in fact hostage to the banking system, and that it has been his unfortunate role to pretend that there is some other fate to bargain for besides this sucker going down. It is probably why he continues to smoke so much. He must be lighting one Marlboro off the tip of another, one after another, in whatever inner sanctum he repairs to when the midnight chimes toll around the White House. Its sad to think of this graceful, still rather young man going down in history as the chump-of-the-century, a reincarnation of Herbert Hoover on steroids, with sugar on top.

Animosities brewing as they are among the white trash elements of the country, I just hope this sucker doesnt resolve into an ugly bout of attempted ethnic cleansing. Certainly Obamas racial make-up has inspired a revival of the Ku Klux spirit around the Nascar ovals. Im sincerely worried that the misdeeds of people named Blankfein, Rubin, and Madoff could provoke a red-white-and-blue pogrom.

The big mystery for the moment is how come a few good men of stature in important places have not stepped forward to say the right thing or do the right deed. How come no US congressperson challenged the knavish behavior of Republicans who condone malicious idiocy that they know to be false like the so-called birther activity. How come no putative progressive has called the Democrats on their disingenuous failure to call illegal immigrants what they are. How come no state attorney general has filed charges against TBTF bank misconduct even if the US attorney general lies in state over at the US DOJ. How come no political figure of any stripe has called for the resignation of Summers, Rubin, Gensler and other Goldman Sachs sleepers infesting high levels of government. How come Dylan Ratigan is the only visible figure in any major newsroom willing to identify the precise nature of the meta-swindle.

When this sucker goes down, our primary task will be reorganizing American life on a much more local and de-complexified basis. Its a very big assignment and especially daunting against a possible background of political disorder. The losses will be epic and the changes severe, but it doesnt have to mean the end of recognizably American culture. There will be very little money around, and it may end up being a certificate backed by gold issued by a bank other than the Federal Reserve. Or maybe well just be swapping stuff for the makings of dinner.

So many forces are roiling around u201Cout thereu201D now that its hard to believe that the authorities in government and banking can keep the illusion of normality going a whole lot longer. The possible litigation against Goldman Sachs–style frauds by a thousand aggrieved victims is enough to paralyze the system. Meanwhile, trillions in credit default swaps are ticking away like dirty bombs. Greece is going down, with Portugal, Spain, Ireland, and the UK standing by to go next. Nobody can pay their bills. Before long, the old folks wont get their checks. Then the poor folks. Lately, I wonder if there will even be an election six months from now.

James Howard Kunstler is perhaps best known for his 2005 book The Long Emergency, which predicted the financial meltdown and the implications of the peak oil problem. His 1993 book, The Geography of Nowhere, about the fiasco of suburbia, is a campus cult classic among the architecture and urban-planning students. It was followed by a sequel, Home From Nowhere, and a companion book called The City in Mind: Notes on the Urban Condition. Mr. Kunstler is also the author of 10 novels including his latest book, World Made By Hand, a story set in America’s post-oil future. His articles have appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Rolling Stone and The Atlantic Monthly.

If you drink too much you will most likely encounter a hangover. Maybe you experienced these more in your younger years, but even the slightest extra alcohol in your system can leave you quite sick the next day. The headaches and nausea are enough to make you swear off drinking altogether!

You might drink a lot water and make some poor food choices to make yourself feel better, but there has to be a better way to cure your poor decision-making. Well, if you’re looking for home remedies for hangovers, look no further. From ancient hangover remedies to a hangover cure for nausea, these are the tips you will learn about to get you back to feeling like yourself – and hopefully drinking less next time!

What is a hangover?

Before we can recommend home remedies for hangovers, what exactly is a hangover – and why does it feel so bad? A hangover occurs the day after a night of too much drinking. Common symptoms of a hangover include headache, nausea, dehydration, dizziness, sleepiness and just overall the feeling of being sick.

Unfortunately, there is no secret to avoiding a hangover as each person breaks down alcohol differently. One person may be able to have an entire bottle of wine where someone else will start feeling sick after one glass – it’s all up to the individual. Because of this, drinking smart is the real secret to avoiding a hangover. But if you’ve gone past the point of no return, then home remedies for hangovers may help you.

Home remedies for hangovers

Below are the top 7 home remedies for hangovers, including ways to combat the pounding headache and nausea:

1. Increase your water intake: Alcohol dehydrates us, so the easiest way to feel better is by becoming hydrated once more. Dehydration can cause tiredness and irritability, two symptoms that only become worse after an evening of drinking. By becoming more hydrated, we can replenish lost fluids caused by the alcohol.

Ideally, for best results, water should be consumed between alcoholic beverages to lessen the severity of the hangover, and a large amount should be drunk before bed so you wake up slightly more refreshed. Furthermore, if you want to get hydrated quicker, sip on coconut water. Coconut water is also great for a hangover because it contains electrolytes and can soothe the stomach as it is also a hangover cure for nausea. Hamilton Beach 67601A ...

2. Bananas: If you need a hangover cure for nausea, look no further than this tropical yellow fruit. Both potassium and magnesium become depleted through drinking, so enjoy some bananas to help boost these nutrients back up. When we are low in potassium that is when we begin to feel nauseous. Better yet, bananas provide us with energy and can work as an antacid to protect our stomachs.

3. Eggs: Eggs are a great way to start off any day, especially a hung-over one. Their high-protein content is a great hangover cure for nausea, as well as helping to improve mood. Eggs also contain essential amino acids which can help remove toxins within the body making you feel much better.

4. Ginger: Ginger is great to treat all stomach-related issues and especially a hangover cure for nausea. Because of its potency, though, your best bet is to add some ginger shavings to some warm water. Not only will you boost your hydration, but you will enjoy the more subtle flavor of ginger to calm your nausea.

5. Carbohydrates: We’re not recommending you chow down on loaves of bread, but toast and crackers are great

home remedies for hangovers. Just like when you have the flu and have toast and crackers, the same principle works when you’re hung-over.

Your liver becomes preoccupied trying to break down all the alcohol and your blood sugar tends to drop. Crackers and toast can help bring it back up and reduce symptoms like irritability and tiredness.

6. Sleep: When it comes to home remedies for hangovers, nothing is easier than sleeping it off. Because alcohol can disrupt your sleep, your body isn’t going through its normal cycles and you feel more tired, have a bigger headache and generally just feel worse. Therefore, an easy, simple way to combat the signs and symptoms of a hangover is just to sleep it off.

7. Fruits and vegetables: A lot of nutrients are diminished by alcohol, so restoring these lost nutrients is a great way to feel better. From B and C vitamins to magnesium and iron, replenishing these nutrients through fruits and vegetables is easy and can make you feel better. Natureu2019s Way Activ... Buy New $$6.05 (as of 11:10 EST - Details)

You may wish to blend many options in a blender – chewing food may not appeal! Start with a kale or spinach and continue to add other fruits and vegetables of your choice. Using water or coconut water as the liquid is a sure way to replenish lost fluid as well. Making a powerhouse smoothie is a great home remedy for hangovers.

How not to treat a hangover

Now that we know effective home remedies for hangovers, there are certain things you shouldn’t do. For starters, avoid coffee. Coffee is a diuretic so it can deplete your fluids even more so than they already are. And although you may feel temporarily awake, once the buzz wears off you’ll be left feeling much worse. Not only will you have a hangover headache, but now you’re adding in a java-withdrawal headache which isn’t a good combination.

Furthermore, although you may want to reach for painkillers as a means for a drunk headache remedy, stay away from acetaminophen – Tylenol, for example. Because your liver is working so hard to break down the alcohol, adding in this form of over-the-counter medication can lead to liver damage. Also, it’s not advised to mix alcohol and acetaminophen together.

And what about that craving for greasy food? Many people feel that the greasier the food fix, the better you’ll feel. This is not proven and will probably only leave you feeling guilty. You will have consumed additional calories through drinking (and probably some unhealthy snacks as well!) and now you’re adding more unhealthy choices the following day.

Greasy food isn’t good for us on a good day, let alone with a hangover. Stick to whole foods instead that can provide you with vitamins and minerals.

Unusual home remedies for hangovers

Everything we’ve mentioned is simple to incorporate, but there are some pretty unique hangover remedies that you might want to consider. Natureu2019s Way Ginge... Buy New $$4.91 (as of 11:00 EST - Details)

For example, ever thought of consuming algae as a cure for a hangover? Well, an Asian fresh water plant called chlorella may hold the secret to curing a hangover. Chlorella has been hailed for its ability to detox the liver as well as reduce symptoms of a hangover – essentially curing it. Additionally, chlorella contains vitamins and minerals so it can help restore the body.

It’s recommended that you drink the algae, but if the taste is too much you can dilute it in some lemon water.

Ancient hangover remedies involved wearing a leafy necklace. This remedy was hailed as a “drunken headache remedy” with the leaves from a shrub called Alexandrian chamaedaphne. This ancient hangover remedy is merely speculation from ancient text and the validity of this remedy is unknown.

Key to avoiding hangover is prevention

There are many home remedies for a hangover you can partake in, from managing your headache and nausea to taking note of ancient hangover remedies, but the best possible thing you can do for a hangover is to prevent it.

As we mentioned, alternating your alcoholic drinks with water will keep you hydrated and ease the pain you may feel the next day. Also, ensure you eat a well-balanced meal before drinking which can absorb much of the alcohol. This method is also effective in ensuring you don’t get too drunk too quickly.

Lastly, know your limit. Don’t try to keep up with others and always drink responsibly. With these tips and home remedies, you can still enjoy your evening and recover a bit quicker the following day.

469956,"Thursday is a fateful day for the world, as the US, other members of the United Nations Security Council, and Germany meet in Geneva with Iran in a bid to resolve outstanding issues. Although Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had earlier attempted to put the nuclear issue off the bargaining table, this rhetorical flourish was a mere opening gambit and nuclear issues will certainly dominate the talks. As Henry Kissinger pointed out, these talks are just beginning and there are highly unlikely to be any breakthroughs for a very long time. Diplomacy is a marathon, not a sprint.

But on this occasion, I thought I’d take the opportunity to list some things that people tend to think they know about Iran, but for which the evidence is shaky.

Belief: Iran is aggressive and has threatened to attack Israel, its neighbors or the US

Reality: Iran’s military budget is a little over $$6 billion annually. Sweden, Singapore and Greece all have larger military budgets. Moreover, Iran is a country of 70 million, so that its per capita spending on defense is tiny compared to these others, since they are much smaller countries with regard to population. Iran spends less per capita on its military than any other country in the Persian Gulf region with the exception of the United Arab Emirates.

American Raj: America ... Eric Margolis Best Price: $$14.94 Buy New $$111.84 (as of 09:20 EST - Details)

Belief: Iran has threatened to attack Israel militarily and to ""wipe it off the map.""

Reality: No Iranian leader in the executive has threatened an aggressive act of war on Israel, since this would contradict the doctrine of ""no first strike"" to which the country has adhered. The Iranian president has explicitly said that Iran is not a threat to any country, including Israel.

Belief: But didn’t President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad threaten to ‘wipe Israel off the map?’

Reality: President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad did quote Ayatollah Khomeini to the effect that ""this Occupation regime over Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time"" (in rezhim-e eshghalgar-i Qods bayad as safheh-e ruzgar mahv shavad). This was not a pledge to roll tanks and invade or to launch missiles, however. It is the expression of a hope that the regime will collapse, just as the Soviet Union did. It is not a threat to kill anyone at all.

Belief: But aren’t Iranians Holocaust deniers?

Actuality: Some are, some aren’t. Former president Mohammad Khatami has castigated Ahmadinejad for questioning the full extent of the Holocaust, which he called ""the crime of Nazism."" Many educated Iranians in the regime are perfectly aware of the horrors of the Holocaust. In any case, despite what propagandists imply, neither Holocaust denial (as wicked as that is) nor calling Israel names is the same thing as pledging to attack it militarily.

213950,"Recently by Justin Raimondo: Iranian Terror Plot: Fake, Fake, Fake

Would Iran recruit a used car salesman with a memory problem to conduct assassinations in the US?

This is a question you have to ask yourself when evaluating the alleged Iranian ""terrorist"" plot supposedly uncovered by Attorney General Eric Holder the other day. The arrest of Mansour Arbabsiar, a 56-year-old Iranian immigrant who came to this country as a college student, was the occasion for a trumpet blast of anti-Iranian propaganda and belligerent declarations by US officials, who vowed to ""hold Iran accountable"" for purportedly mounting a plot [.pdf] to kill the Saudi ambassador, bomb the Saudi and Israeli embassies in Washington, and strike at the Jewish community in Argentina.

The alleged plot was supposed to have been carried out by a member of the Zetas drug cartel, who was to be paid up to $$1.5 million to implement the plan. US officials, even while acknowledging the ""B-movie"" aspect of the story, reportedly ""fanned out"" to convince our allies the plot was real and — with Congress already demanding new sanctions on Iran — that the economic vise be tightened. Not only are the more hysterical neocons calling for military action against Iran — no surprise there — but the headlines had the normally staid and relatively reserved Steve Clemons, a prominent Obama shill, babbling that ""this is a serious situation"" and ""the U.S. has reached a point where it must take action,"" and Sen. Carl Levin calling the plot ""an act of war.""

Less than 24 hours after Holder’s press conference, the whole fantasy began to unravel under closer scrutiny. Gary Sick, of the Middle East Institute at Columbia University, averred that the alleged plot ""departs from all known Iranian policies and procedures,"" and went on to write:

""It is difficult to believe that they would rely on a non-Islamic criminal gang to carry out this most sensitive of all possible missions. In this instance, they allegedly relied on at least one amateur and a Mexican criminal drug gang that is known to be riddled with both Mexican and U.S. intelligence agents.

""Whatever else may be Iran’s failings, they are not noted for utter disregard of the most basic intelligence tradecraft, e.g. discussing an ultra-covert operation on an open international line between Iran and the U.S. Yet that is what happened here.""

Kenneth Katzman, a Middle East analyst with the Congressional Research Office, concurs:

""There is simply no precedent  or even reasonable rationale  for Iran working any plot, no matter where located, through a non-Muslim proxy such as Mexican drug gangs. No one high up in the Quds, the I.R.G.C. command, the Supreme National Security Committee, or anywhere else in the Iranian chain of command would possibly trust that such a plot could be kept secret or carried out properly by the Mexican drug people. They absolutely would not trust such a thing to them, given Iran’s undoubted assumption that the Mexicans are penetrated by the D.E.A. and F.B.I. and A.T.F., etc  and indeed this plot was revealed by just such a U.S. informant….

""Are we to believe that this Texas car seller was a Quds sleeper agent for many years resident in the U.S.? Ridiculous. They (the Iranian command system) never ever use such has-beens or loosely connected people for sensitive plots such as this.""

Ridiculous — that just about says it all.

But as Ayn Rand once said: ""Don’t bother to question a fallacy, ask yourself only what it accomplishes."" The idea is to target Iran as the next al-Qaeda: with the late unlamented Osama bin Laden out of the picture, the US has to find a replacement — and quick! — in order to justify its decade-long post-9/11 rampage across the Middle East and much of the rest of the world. What’s a war without an enemy? Iran has always been the War Party’s ultimate Middle Eastern target, and now they are making their move.

As an opening shot in a propaganda war, Holder’s startling announcement had high impact — but low credibility, as the excitement died down and the details came into focus. The problem with the narrative woven by the Justice Department is that the supposed fulcrum of this heinous plot, Senor Arbabsiar, is hardly the sort of character who makes a convincing terrorist/foreign agent. Longtime associate Tom Hosseini, a fellow Iranian-American who has known Arbabsiar for over 30 years, wondered aloud to a Washington Post reporter ""how anyone — but most especially an elite military organization such as Iran’s Quds force  would get involved with Arbabsiar in the first place.""

""Maybe,"" says Hosseini, ""somebody offered him some money. He doesn’t have the brain to say no.""

Arbabsiar certainly had a lot of money on him when he and Hosseini met in Iranian Kurdistan last August: the Post reports he was ""waving around crisp $$100 bills"" and declaring that there was a lot more where that came from. Yet Arbabsiar’s many businesses — ""from used cars to kebabs"" — had all failed. Perhaps this lack of business acumen was tied to his general inability to think straight, or, as the Post puts it:

""Within the small Iranian American community in this Gulf Coast city, Arbabsiar, 56, was well known and well liked. But he was also renowned for being almost comically absent-minded, perpetually losing keys, cellphones, briefcases, anything that wasn’t tied down.""

I don’t mean “terrible” in a normative sense, though he often deploys bullshit for ends that I find morally abhorrent. I mean “terrible” in the sense of lacking skill. Even if you adjust your measurements to reflect his profession (where bullshit is nearly omnipresent), Netanyahu’s phoniness is obvious.

But when Netanyahu tried to respond to a criticism levied his way by supporters of an agreement — that he wouldn’t accept any deal with the Iranian regime, short of its complete capitulation — he meandered over the line separating alarmism from bullshit. The choice wasn’t between compromise and war, he said. There was “a third alternative” of “standing firm, [and] ratcheting up the pressure until you get a better deal.”

As countless people familiar with the issue have noted, it’s hard to imagine Netanyahu’s strategy not backfiring spectacularly. If the West walked away from negotiations, as Netanyahu recommends, it’s unlikely that countries in the European Union would respond by increasing sanctions to force Iran to be more compliant. What’s more likely is that they’d blame the U.S., relax their sanctions, and get back in business with the regime instead. As far as many businesspeople in Europe, China and Russia see it, time and money are being wasted; and many of them don’t particularly care if Israel is under threat.

461330,"On 9/11, All Failed But Rugged Individuals

by James Ostrowski by James Ostrowski

""The first truth to be discovered about human action is that it can be undertaken only by individual u2018actors.’. . . There are no such things as ends of or actions by u2018groups,’ u2018collectives,’ or u2018States,’ which do not take place as actions by various specific individuals.""

~ Murray Rothbard, Man, Economy and State

I read the description of the hijackings on 9/11 in the commission report and one thing is clear. Everyone failed on 9/11 to prevent the hijackings and subsequent attacks — the government and the highly-regulated large corporate airlines and their employees who had responsibilities for preventing hijackings or defending against hijacked planes — everyone failed, except the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93.

Facing dangers most of us will never face, and displaying courage few of us possess, they forced the terrorists to crash the plane in a field in Pennsylvania. The terrorists had been a mere 20 minutes from Washington D. C., where they certainly would have tried to murder thousands of people.

The passenger assault began at 9:57. It lasted about five minutes. They evidently tried to break into the cockpit. Most likely, they used a service cart to ram the cockpit door. The terrorists responded by rocking the plane right and left, and, when that didn’t work, pitching the plane up and down. Both tactics failed to stop the determined and desperate assault.

At 10:00:26, one passenger said, ""In the cockpit. If we don’t we’ll die."" The terrorists knew they had been defeated. The report continues:

""With the sounds of the passenger counterattack continuing, the aircraft plowed into an empty field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, at 580 miles per hour, about twenty minutes flying time from Washington, D. C."" (Emphasis added.)

On 9/11, big government failed; big business failed; the corporate state failed. The lone individual, facing impossible odds and certain death, acting jointly and spontaneously with his like-minded brethren and sisthren, rose to the challenge. The paper pushers failed; the cart pushers prevailed.

""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."" John 15-13. How about a national monument to these amazing heroes?

223265,"I don’t normally visit websites like Military.com. The glorification of all things military just doesn’t appeal to me, as you can well imagine if you have read any of my articles on the military.

Military.com is said to be “the online presence of Military Advantage.” It “is committed to the mission of connecting the military community to all the advantages earned in service to America.” It was founded in 1999 “to revolutionize the way the 30 million Americans with military affinity stay connected and informed.” It is now the largest military and veteran membership organization, with more than 10 million members.

I did happen to visit the site recently after I came across an article by Marco O’Brien, a contributing editor at Military.com titled “5 Reasons to Join the Military Now!” Imagine my surprise when I happened to see another piece of his titled “Reasons To Not Join the Military.”

To join or not join, that is the question. But of course, O’Brien’s reasons to not join the military are no reasons at all, as we shall presently see.

Although I have given many reasons on many different occasions for joining or not joining the military, I thought I would present the reasons O’Brien gives for joining or not joining and then offer my own.

In “5 Reasons to Join the Military Now!” O’Brien first lists a general reason, followed by an explanation, and then followed by a military solution. To keep this from getting too long, I will list his general reasons and provide the main part of his solutions (I have corrected a few typos). You can read his entire piece online if interested.

Reason 1 – The Job Market

Solution – Not only is the military hiring, but the military is actually increasing its numbers over the next several years. No experience is necessary and all entry-level jobs come with great pay and benefits!

Reason 2 – Rising Cost of College

Solution – The Military’s Tuition assistance program pays up to 100% of the first $$4,500 each year of your tuition costs while serving on active duty. In addition there is the MGIB and the Post 9/11 G.I Bill.

Reason 3 – Health Care

Solution – The military has a great health care plan for individuals and families. How about full coverage with little or no costs to service members or their families? Top-notch health care for free, it doesn’t get much better than that.

Reason 4 – You want to own a home someday!

Solution – Military service men and women have a unique avenue to obtain home loans through the Veteran’s Administration.

Reason 5 – You aren’t getting any younger!

Solution – Join Now! – If you enter active duty at the age of 18 you can be retired from the military at age 38. Don’t be one of those people who look back and regret not joining when they were young.

In “Reasons To Not Join the Military,” O’Brien lists five reasons, each followed by an explanation. Because this is relatively short, I will reproduce the entire piece:

1. You want an education and have at least $$40,000 dollars just sitting around for you to use. Education is very expensive and $$40,000 is actually a very conservative estimate for a 4-year degree. If you don’t want to take advantage of the military paying 100% of your tuition while on active duty and giving you upwards of $$50,000 dollars through the GI Bill to use on active duty or up to 10 years after you get out, then the military is not for you.

2. You absolutely do not want to have a job that gives you any kind of vacation time! If you are one of those people who never likes being away from the work place then the military is not for you. The military gives you 30 days of paid vacation every year starting with your first year. It could take 20 years with some civilian companies to build up that much time off.

3. You get a scared feeling every time you even think about leaving your hometown. Some people like where they live and have no desire to travel the world at someone else’s expense. The military has installations all over the world and gives its members opportunities to travel like no other company in the world.

4. You would feel way too guilty receiving free medical care for you and your family! Being riddled with guilt can be pretty terrible. If you can’t imagine ever having free health care for you, let alone for your wife and kids then the military is not for you. Imagine how bad you would feel accepting the military’s world-class health care and not paying a dime for it.

5. You want to be really old when you finally retire from a company. There’s good news and bad news here. If you join the military at 18 years old you can retire and start collecting your retirement at 38 years old, now that is the bad news you won’t be really old when you retire from the military. The good news is you are only 38 years old and can go and work at another job until you are really old. The military’s 20-year retirement is an awesome benefit if you want to retire young.

These could, of course, be rephrased as five reasons to join the military: education benefits (see Reason 2 above), employment (see Reason 1 above), travel, free health care (see Reason 3 above), early retirement (see Reason 5 above).

In each of his short articles, O’Brien makes a good case for joining the military from a financial point of view. But there are other reasons to join or not join the military that he has not mentioned.

Here are five reasons to join the military from a slightly different perspective:

1. To kill people. Young men have been killing people by the thousands for years in their video games. I guess that is why the military uses these games as recruiting tools. The aphorism “Join the Army, travel the world, meet interesting people, and kill them” has never been truer. Just ask the hundreds of thousand of dead Iraqis and Afghans.

2. To build your ego. You can wear your uniform in an airport and be thanked for your service by throngs of people you have never seen before. You can wear your uniform to church the Sunday before Memorial Day, the Fourth of July, or Veterans Day and be asked to stand while someone asks God to bless the troops. And when you leave the military, just telling people you are a veteran will bring forth shouts of glory, laud, and honor.

3. To be part of the president’s personal attack force. Since World War II, the U.S. military has been exclusively used by the president for purposes other than the actual defense of the country. Soldiers that went to Iraq and Afghanistan, like those that went to Korea, Vietnam, and all the other countries where the U.S. military had no business going, go as part of the president’s personal army. And if they join for financial reasons – as recommended by Marco O’Brien – then they are simply mercenaries like the British hired to fight Americans during the Revolutionary War.

4. To commit random acts of depravity and violence. Want to urinate on dead bodies? Want to bomb wedding parties? Want to kill civilians for sport? Want to rape foreign women? Want to take body parts as trophies? Want to destroy a town and its entire infrastructure? Want to pose for photos with murdered civilians? Want to torture and humiliate prisoners? Then the military is the place for you.

5. To pervert the purpose of the military. Invading countries, occupying other countries, enforcing UN resolutions, nation building, establishing democracy, changing regimes, training foreign armies, opening markets, supplying peacekeepers, assassinating people, maintaining no-fly zones, providing disaster relief, dispensing humanitarian aid, and fighting foreign wars – that is, anything but actually “defending our freedoms” – perverts the purpose of the military.

And here are five real reasons to not join the military:

1. To be killed. There are almost 5,000 U.S. military personnel who came home from Iraq in a flag-draped coffin or a body bag – if there were enough pieces of them to be picked up in the desert sands. Another 2,000 U.S. troops died in Afghanistan. And for what? Absolutely nothing. They all died in vain and for a lie. Why be added to those casualties?

2. To destroy your family. Multiple duty tours and increased deployment terms are the death knell for stable families. Do you think it is good to deprive a child of his father, and in many cases his mother, for months at a time? What makes you think that the military will never send you away from your family for an extended period of time? What makes you think that you and your family will be able to “handle it”? U.S. military families are the unseen victims of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

3. To never have another independent thought. You will be expected to blindly follow the orders of your superiors without questioning their purpose or morality. You will often times not be in a position to know whether an order is in fact dubious or immoral. You will be expected to, without reservation, drop that bomb, fire that weapon, launch that missile, and throw that grenade, as well as kill people and destroy their property.

4. To suffer severe injuries. Many thousands of U.S. military personnel have been wounded in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Hundreds have had limbs amputated. Untold numbers suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some soldiers will spend the rest of their lives unable to work or drive a car. Others will live out their days as physical and/or emotional basket cases. What makes you think that you will not be sent to Afghanistan, Yemen, or some other God-forsaken place the U.S. military has no business being and emerge unscathed in body and mind?

5. To commit suicide. The suicide rate among active duty and veterans of the military is at an all-time high. No one joins the military with the intention of committing suicide, but dealing with broken relationships, strained families, chronic pain, PTSD, depression, deaths of fellow soldiers, substance abuse, multiple deployments, and/or adjusting to life after the military can come with a price that some are not willing to pay.

To join or not join, that is the question. Your life and the life of your family depend on your decision. After you join, you may never be stationed overseas, never face enemy fire, never be in danger, have a wonderful family, made a comfortable living, see the world, retire after twenty years, and then get a good job with a government contractor – and then again you may not do any of these things. You may die in a training accident before you are old enough to drink. Whatever you do, don’t listen to the promises of the lying pimps known as military recruiters.

90076,"Heard the one about the couple that paid £40,000 for a new kitchen in 2005 and have only just started using it? It is not a joke. The days are dwindling when tables for six in well-reviewed restaurants were full every night. Dining at home is back. Sales of dinner party food are outperforming 2008 figures by more than 100 per cent; supermarkets are seeing wine sales rocket by as much as 200 per cent. But the re-born dinner party is a rather different affair to the classic image of a dining room table laid with polished silver. Eat out in someone else’s home, post credit crunch, and you are more likely to be served supper in the kitchen, dining on a casserole with good red wine bought at a third of restaurant prices.

I would not go so far as to suggest that eating in is the new eating out. After all, you can walk out of a bad restaurant, but not a dud dinner party. Restaurants offering good value are still busy, and Michelin-starred establishments forced into tempting deals. Arbutus in Soho does an early evening, three-course meal for £17.50 and Bentley’s in Piccadilly will serve you a glass of Muscadet and half a dozen oysters for under £10. But hosts who once booked the bigger tables are wary. ""You can’t really tell your guests to stick to the set menu, or hold back from the lobster,"" says a friend who would formerly have taken friends and colleagues out, rather than invite them home.

“I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.” ~ James Carville

In the American West, an unofficial assembly of private citizens known as vigilantes would gather together to exact vengeance against some suspected evil-doer who had the backing of the local politicians and who could not be prosecuted. If they had a symbol, it was a noose.

There has been a strange fascination with them over the years. They have been ideal candidates for Western movies, from The Ox-Bow Incident to Hang ‘Em High. Called lynch mobs in other contexts, they have often been seen as necessary evils.

I never agreed with the phrase “bond vigilantes.” There is nothing illegal about investors staging a boycott against government bonds because they do not trust either the government or the central bank. The bond investor who says “no” at some price (interest rate) is exercising his legal right as a property owner. He is saying, “I don’t trust the government at this low rate of interest. There should be an inflation premium built into this rate.”

In recent months in Europe, another factor reared its head: the risk premium. For the first time since 1950, investors contemplated the possibility that West European governments might default on their debts. Governments had long promoted the convenient fiction that sovereign debts are always honored by politicians.

So, the phrase “bond vigilantes” probably had its origin in a spin-room of the federal government. Bond investors who demand higher rates are regarded as traitors by politicians. They have broken faith with the full faith and credit of the United States. They say: “A little faith, yes, but not as much as before.”

The bond investor is far closer to a juror than he is to a vigilante. The juror assesses the credibility of testimony by the Treasury. Maybe he votes to release the prisoner. Maybe he votes for a felony manslaughter conviction.

At some point, the jury may even convict for murder conviction. “Guilty as charged, your honor.”

BILL CLINTON MEETS THE BOND MARKET

In late 1992, after his election but before his inauguration, he outlined his economic program to a group of advisors. It was the usual Great Society stuff. Bob Woodward described this meeting in his book, “The Agenda.” In the room was economist Alan Blinder, soon to be part of Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisors, and later to become Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.

After listening to Clinton’s agenda, Blinder said this. Falling interest rates on Treasury bonds could offset a decline of economic growth due to a reduction in federal spending. (This is standard Keynesian nonsense, as if a reduction of federal spending will not be offset by increases in private spending.) Blinder had doubts that rates would fall. Why? Because, he said, “after ten years of fiscal shenanigans, the bond market will not likely respond.”

Clinton’s reaction has become part of the Clinton legacy, only a few notches below “I did not have sex with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.”

At the president-elect’s end of the table, Clinton’s face turned red with anger and disbelief. “You mean to tell me that the success of the program and my re-election hinges on the Federal Reserve and a bunch of [expletive deleted] bond traders?” he responded in a half whisper.

Nods from his end of the table. Not a dissent.

Clinton, it seemed to Blinder, perceived at this moment how much of his fate was passing into the hands of the unelected Greenspan and the bond market.

Blinder was right. The bond traders decided not to buy bonds at low rates. From October 1993 to November 1994 10-year yields climbed from 5.2% to just over 8.0%. Investors were worried about federal spending. With guidance from Treasury Secretary Robert “Goldman Sachs” Rubin, the Clinton Administration and Congress made an effort to reduce the deficit. Ten-year yields dropped to approximately 4% by November 1998. Clinton ran surpluses in the last three fiscal years  the first time since fiscal year 1969.

Yes, Clinton’s surpluses are mythical. They relied on Social Security payments. You can read about the myth here. But, compared with his predecessors, he ran a tight ship. The bond market forced his hand.

THAT WAS THEN. THIS IS NOW.

A recent Wall Street Journal article brings us up to date about the power of bond traders.

No longer can investors’ bond-selling campaigns pressure officials into politically unpopular tax increases or spending cuts, measures that both Clinton and his predecessor, George H.W. Bush, were forced to adopt to improve the fiscal balance and support bond prices.

What has changed? The Federal Reserve System’s policies. Its decision-makers have decided to accommodate whatever deficits that Congress and the President agree to. “The central bank’s giant purchases in the Treasury market and near-zero interest rates have supported bond prices and marginalized private-activist bond investors.”

Bond yields (rates) are trading at historic lows. But I have argued for two years that these low rates are not the result of FED monetary inflation. Monetary inflation tends to raise long-term rates, because bond investors demand a higher rate of return to compensate them for rising prices, i.e., falling real income.

What is holding rates down is fear. Borrowers fear to borrow; bankers fear to lend. Instead, bankers turn the money over to the FED as excess reserves, for which they are paid essentially nothing. The article admits this, but attributes this to fear in the eurozone. But this decline in rates began three years ago.

That is partly due to the “flight to safety” that Treasurys have enjoyed as investors escape exposure to the euro-zone debt crisis, but it is also because of the Fed’s yield-suppressing actions, which are aimed at encouraging investors to take risks and bolster the economic recovery, and are made possible by a benign inflation environment.

What needs explaining is “the benign inflation environment.” The answer is rising excess reserves, which have offset the increase in the FED’s monetary base.

Chris Ahrens, head of U.S. interest-rate strategy at UBS Securities LLC, in Stamford, Conn., said until risk appetites rekindle and disinflation fears dissipate, the bond vigilante is likely to be “as scarce as the Abominable Snowman.”

So, the FED is trapped. On the one hand, if the U.S. economy remains in the pits, fear will win. Bankers will not lend the money they are legally allowed to lend. The money will not get into the economy. This means that Keynesian pump-priming in the form of $$1.3 trillion federal deficits will not work their magic. Stagnation will become permanent, unless there is a recession and things get worse.

On the other hand, if the skies clear, and businessmen start singing “happy days are here again,” bankers will lend. The FED’s monetary base, which went from $$900 billion in late 2007 to $$3 trillion today will work its black magic. Prices will double or worse. That is hyperinflation. But it has not happened yet.

And although critics have said the Fed has distorted the normal functioning of the Treasury bond markets by crowding out private investors, inflation  the biggest threat to bonds’ fixed value over time and a big worry for fixed-income investors  has remained muted and given the central bank wiggle room.

BERNANKE’S NOOSE

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which decides monetary policy, remains in a deflationary mindset. It has ever since July 2011, as this chart reveals.

So, it is clear that the cause of today’s low rates is not monetary inflation. It is fear. Investors think the safest place for their money is in U.S. Treasury debt. There are so many of these investors that the Treasury can borrow money almost for free for 90 days. It can borrow long term for very little.

This puts Bernanke in the catbird seat. Consumer price inflation continues in the 2% per year range. This is low enough so that inflation hawks and bond traders are mute. At the same time, economic growth is in the 2% range. It is high enough so that most Keynesians are not demanding another round of monetary base expansion.

Keynesians want a larger federal deficit, not more fiat money. Keynesian theory identifies the major economic responsibility of government as fiscal policy: taxing and spending. They become advocates of fiat money expansion whenever rising Treasury rates threaten the deficit. That is not the case today.

Bernanke has Ron Paul on his case, but not for long. Paul will retire in January 2013. If he is elected President, this will be a nightmare for Bernanke. It will be a nightmare for the Establishment in general. Council on Foreign Relations Team B would not replace Council on Foreign Relations Team A for the first time since 1928. Unthinkable! So, the Establishment is hoping that Paul will drop out.

So, Bernanke bides his time. He is not being attacked by the mainstream media. He can operate in the shadows, coming out to give his trademarked, footnote-laden speeches that describe what has happened recently, which everyone knows, and list hypothetical FED policies as fallback positions if the current do-nothing policy fails.

This is an ideal period for Bernanke. He can sit on the sidelines. No one except Ron Paul is calling for his scalp, such as it is. He is in Goldilocks country: not too inflationary, not too recessionary, just right. Millions of workers remain unemployed, but this can be blamed on “tight” fiscal policy. That’s not Bernanke’s department. That’s for Congress to resolve.

Bernanke never tires of nagging Congress to get its fiscal house in order. He knows that this is not going to happen. So, he can play the Stern uncle. On February 9, 2011, he lectured the House Budget Committee.

To put the budget on a sustainable trajectory, policy actions  either reductions in spending, increases in revenues, or some combination of the two  will have to be taken to eventually close these primary budget gaps.

By definition, the unsustainable trajectories of deficits and debt that the CBO outlines cannot actually happen, because creditors would never be willing to lend to a government with debt, relative to national income, that is rising without limit. One way or the other, fiscal adjustments sufficient to stabilize the federal budget must occur at some point. The question is whether these adjustments will take place through a careful and deliberative process that weighs priorities and gives people adequate time to adjust to changes in government programs or tax policies, or whether the needed fiscal adjustments will come as a rapid and painful response to a looming or actual fiscal crisis. Acting now to develop a credible program to reduce future deficits would not only enhance economic growth and stability in the long run, but could also yield substantial near-term benefits in terms of lower long-term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence.

Then he could go back to his office and think: “That ought to hold them for another six months.”

Four months later, when a fight over raising the debt ceiling broke out, he dutifully came down on the side of the ceiling-busters.

Failing to raise the debt limit would require the federal government to delay or renege on payments for obligations already entered into. In particular, even a short suspension of payments on principal or interest on the Treasury’s debt obligations could cause severe disruptions in financial markets and the payments system, induce ratings downgrades of U.S. government debt, create fundamental doubts about the creditworthiness of the United States, and damage the special role of the dollar and Treasury securities in global markets in the longer term. Interest rates would likely rise, slowing the recovery and, perversely, worsening the deficit problem by increasing required interest payments on the debt for what might well be a protracted period.

So, he covers both cheeks of his backside. He plays stern uncle when he lectures Congress on deficits in general, and then plays lenient uncle when push comes to shove over the deficit specifically.

CONCLUSION

The FED is in wait-and-see mode. As long as Congress lets Bernanke alone, he can sit tight. Like a gambler playing for the house and sitting with a pile of chips, with a chip-making machine in the back room, Bernanke can afford to bide his time. He can play for small stakes, steadily building his pile.

He is like any other bureaucrat. As long as he can evade criticism, he is content. Unlike all other bureaucrats in Washington, his agency gets to set its own budget. The FED keeps whatever money it needs to run its operations. At the beginning of each calendar year, it pays the Treasury whatever it has left over after expenses. This year, it paid $$76.9 billion retroactively for 2011.

The name of the bureaucratic game is survival. Bernanke is a survivor. He is not going to rock the boat. He is determined not to get blamed if the boat capsizes. He will take action  inflation  if the necessity arises. Then bond rates will rise. Then the bond traders will reassert themselves. But, for now, he has hanged them high.

Simple facts most soldiers do not understand: The government (state) is not our country; when you fight and die in undeclared wars, you do so for the State and not for our country or our freedoms; when you forsake the Constitution you swore to uphold and defend to follow unconstitutional orders, even from your commander-in-chief, you cross the line from defender of your country to the very real possibility of becoming a war criminal.

The inboxes at my email sites are constantly bombarded with pictures and articles designed to pull at my heartstrings and make me believe there are troops in Iraq and Afghanistan fighting for our freedoms. Many of these have wonderful stirring music intended to make one stand and salute. They picture our soldiers holding young Iraqi children and playing with stray animals — a fit sermon indeed for those who hold membership in the Church of Nationalism and worship its god: the State.

Does the insurgent in Iraq present a greater danger to freedom than the politicians who signed the Patriot Act without reading it? Is al Qaeda to be feared more than the suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus? Is the young Iraqi soldier fighting in the streets of Baghdad more dangerous to our freedoms than the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act, which allows the State to take direct control of any and all National Guard units over the objection of state and local officials to whom they report, through the simple expedient of declaring a “public emergency”? Just exactly who is the greatest threat to our individual rights and freedoms in this country?

In November of 2002, I was asked to present the commencement speech at the graduating class of Military Intelligence Officers at Ft. Huachuca, Arizona. It was a very difficult decision for me to accept this invitation; the storm clouds of war were definitely on the horizon. I had seen what I believed to be tainted intelligence in the media used to garner support for a war in Iraq. I wanted to do or say nothing that might in any way be seen as support for the coming conflict — those who promoted it, or those who would fight it — an almost impossible feat to accomplish in a military environment.

When the day arrived and I was introduced to those in attendance, which included high-ranking officers of the post, graduates, instructors, parents and guests, I began my presentation by asking how many in attendance remembered their oath of enlistment.

Everyone raised a hand indicating they did. I then asked how many could repeat that oath; a significantly smaller number raised their hand. I then read the Oath of Enlistment each soldier takes on entry into the various military branches. I emphasized the following was listed first in the oath and was therefore intended to be the most important:

“I, _____ , having been appointed an officer in the Army of the United States, as indicated above in the grade of _____ do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign or domestic, that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; …

I reminded them it was their duty to fully understand the meaning of the words and phrases: support, defend, and true faith and allegiance in the context of that oath. I told them that anytime they received orders, no matter the origin of those orders, when such orders were in conflict with their oath, they were honor bound to refuse to carry out those orders. I told them their first allegiance was to the Constitution and not to any politician who became their superior simply because they had tricked a majority of the people into voting for them. By this time the higher-ranking officers on the front row were beginning to squirm in their seats.

I spoke of domestic enemies and how much more insidious they are than those we call ""foreign."" I explained that when one is ordered by any superior to do that which is a violation of their oath, the entity issuing the illegal order becomes the domestic enemy mentioned in their oath.

I spoke to those gathered of my ignorance of my obligation to that oath during my military tenure, and the obvious offenses I felt I had committed and the unlawful orders I had obeyed. I stated I did not want them to make the same mistakes I had made. When I finished my presentation, the ranking officers on the front row made a hasty departure, but other instructors and soldiers stayed and presented their perfunctory appreciation.

I’m sure many of the young officers in attendance that day did not fully understand the presentation; most were in a hurry to check out, and get started on their leave before their next assignment.

Several days later, my son came to visit and was obviously in a state of anger. He related he had just returned from the Tucson, Arizona office of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) where he was interviewed for his Top Secret Clearance. During his interview the agent conducting his background check informed him that I was both a subversive and a racist; subversive because I had written articles critical of the government and racist because I was a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. At least they had it half right; I had written, and continue to write, articles that are critical of the government, but I have never been a member of the SCV. I qualify for membership in that organization because several of my relatives fought for the Confederacy, but I have never applied for membership.

I relate the incident with the agent of the DIA simply to show that once a person drops his/her support for the collective and assumes their individual God given rights, they become the enemy of the State.

Soldiers serving — and dying in the State’s illegal, immoral wars — do not serve their fellow countrymen, fight for our liberties or bear true faith and allegiance to our Constitution — they serve the collective that is busy stealing our liberties and destroying our Constitution.

Not one opposing force in Iraq or Afghanistan, or anyplace else on this planet, presents a greater threat to our liberty than the collective we call the State or the criminals who control it.

Recently by Gary North: The No-Name European Committee That Made the $$13 Billion Guarantee to Cypriot Banks

The conservative movement had always been filled with monetary cranks. This has been true for well over a century.

These cranks have never read a book on economics. They have never taken a class in economics. They have zero practical experience in finance.

They come before the conservative public and present crackpot schemes of monetary inflation, all in the name of conservatism.

Their victims are equally unread, equally unskilled amateurs who think, “Gee, that sounds great! Let’s do it.”

Let’s do what? These cranks never have a plan to get from here to there: the Promised Land. They are like Moses with no escape route into the Promised Land by way of the wilderness. They want to wave a magic wand and get True Money (always capitalized).

These crackpot schemes all partake of the same flaw. They want a government-appointed committee of unelected experts to set up the money and banking system at a zero interest rate. Usually, they want a central bank run by engineers and government statisticians. But all of these schemes rely on government statisticians. All of them reject a gold coin standard where owners of private property  gold coins and bank accounts  are in charge.

These crackpot schemes begin with this presupposition, which is never admitted by any of the designers: “We do not trust private property and the free market. We trust only government experts.” Their zombie followers line up. “Yes, yes, we too believe only in government-employed experts. This is because we are conservatives.” Then out into they night they march, looking for other conservatives with brains to eat. They find them. They always find them.

The bank reformers have no political support for their schemes. But they spend time describing the wonders of their system. They call on people to get behind it. Except for a few crackpot schemes, such as Social Credit or Greenbackism, no one ever joins the political movement. There is no political movement. There are only mindless zombies.

ELECTRICITY AS CURRENCY

Here is a recent example: “Electricity As Currency? 10 Reasons It Could Work.” This was subtitled: “Energy-backed currency concept”

It began with a deliberate deception.

Remember the good old days when gasoline only cost $$1.50/gallon way back in the ancient times of 2000? Why does it cost more than double that today ($$3.71)? A gallon of gas is still a gallon of gas, so it seems obvious that the dollar has lost value.

If you are going to prove currency depreciation by an appeal to statistics, use the Consumer Price Index or the Median CPI. The CPI is most common. Using the Inflation Calculator on the site of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we learn that consumer prices since 2000 have risen by 35%. That is 2.3% per year. This is bad, but it is not anything like mass inflation.

The anonymous writer goes on:

This rapid devaluation of the U.S. dollar makes it an unstable medium of exchange and certainly not a good store of value  two aspects considered to be the main functions of money. This has led many to examine the flaws of the current monetary system and search for possible alternatives.

This is not rapid devaluation. This is steady-as-you-go monetary depreciation. Hardly anyone notices. Hardly anyone cares.

ANTI-GOLD COIN STANDARD

Some have suggested that returning to the Gold Standard (pegging the dollar to gold) will help control the fraudulent expansion of the money supply and protect the value of the currency.

This is familiar. There is both economic theory and economic history that supports this view.

Others say eliminating the interest attached to each dollar created will get rid of scarcity and provide abundance.

This is Greenbackism.

Each of these ideas has merit since they correct some of what’s broken, yet they both also have flaws which make them difficult to fully support.

Greenbackism is totally wrong. It is intellectually bankrupt. Ellen Brown is a prominent Greenbacker. For my detailed refutation of her economic theory and her historical inventions, which she has never answered, go here. (She in fact is a Leftist. She has come out in favor of Bernanke’s QE programs.)

INVOKING NON-ECONOMISTS

These schemes invariably quote engineers and scientists who never wrote a detailed theory of economics.

One interesting alternative that has been proposed is using an energy-backed currency. The idea is not new. Thomas Edison envisioned an “energy dollar” after seeing the value of electricity, and Henry Ford also conceptualized backing a currency by a “unit of energy” instead of gold. Motivated by the failed monetary system during the Great Depression, Ford even planned to support the idea with his own electric dams. Of course the central bankers scolded Ford’s idea because it threatened their schemes.

Henry Ford knew nothing about economic theory. Neither did his friend Edison. They were engineers. They wrote no treatises defending their positions.

In more recent times the idea of using electricity as a currency has gained some traction. An online ebook Energy Backed Money was published in 2009 supporting the concept of backing the dollar with electricity. Kilowatt Cards were introduced as gift cards for electric power meant to be a transferable means of currency. And former NASA scientist, Michael Rivero, proposed the Lectro, a universal electricity based currency whose supply is controlled by production and use of electric power.

Again, these are engineers with no economic theory to support their views.

ANTI-FRACTIONAL RESERVE BANKING

These critics have discovered a central flaw in the modern economy: government-licensed fractional reserve banking. But they never identify the source: government licenses to commit fraud of money creation. They offer no theory of free banking or 100% reserve banking. They never alert their readers to the central fact: these institutions are created by government intervention. There is a reason for this. They always call for a “nrew, improved” government-created, government-managed monopoly over fiat money creation. Here is their unstated but always-present assumption: “You can trust the government.” You can, but you shouldn’t.

First, the attack on fractional reserves.

Currently, Federal Reserve Notes (dollars) are not backed by anything valuable and their value is determined primarily by how much supply is in circulation. The supply of money under our current system is lent into existence as fast or as slow as the bankers or the government determines, leaving a lot of room for manipulation.

Here is the problem: there is lots of room for manipulation. This is the problem with every system of money that is not a commodity-based money system that is governed by the free market.

Significantly, all money is lent into existence with interest owed to central bankers.

This is always the creation of national governments. There is a simple solution: revoke the legislation. Nothing else? Nothing else. This was how Andrew Jackson got rid of the Second Bank of the United States in 1836. When it lost its government license, it went bankrupt.

Second, an attack on the existence of interest rates, which in fact are an inescapable aspect of human action  a discount applied to expected future income  as Ludwig von Mises taught.

But this interest is money yet to be created in the system so there are never enough dollars in the system to pay off the debt accrued from the creation of the dollars themselves. This creates a false scarcity and the perpetual need to expand the money supply, which then breeds inflation. This simultaneous scarcity and inflation have a tremendously negative impact on the economy, especially for the poor. Ultimately, it’s this interest on every dollar created that inherently enslaves us all to the central bankers who hadn’t produced anything of value to demand our servitude.

This is crackpottery. It says that there should be no interest rate. There is always a discount for time. The surest mark of a crackpot is the call for a rate of interest of zero. There are no exceptions to this rule. Whenever you see a call for zero interest, you are seeing the equivalent of a call for a perpetual motion machine.

The only way to solve the inefficiencies of the current system is to use a currency that has real value, whose supply is tied to an accurate economic indicator, and doesn’t need interest attached just for the sake of creating it.

This attack on interest denies a fundamental category of human action: “now, not later.” This was refuted by Austrian School economists in the late 19th century. Read Chapter XIX of Mises’s book, Human Action.

Fourth, the call for a non-market standard of economic value.

Electricity has measurable value in our society and since everything in our modern world runs on power, it may be the most accurate gauge of economic activity we have.

No, it doesn’t. Nothing in this world has a measurable value. There is no yardstick of economic value. Value is subjective. It is constantly changing, because individuals keep changing their scale of values as conditions change, including their tastes.

An electricity-backed currency would not be nearly as complicated as our fractional reserve system. It could work something like this: electric producers could issue certificates (money) as kilowatts are produced and they would be removed from circulation once the electric bill is paid (redeeming their receipts), thus always maintaining a consistent and stable supply.

Kilowatts are not measures of economic value. They are a measure of physical flow. The measurement of this flow is in no way the measure of value. The free market establishes economic value.

In good times, these units of electricity keep getting cheaper. The price of a kilowatt in 1910 was a lot higher than it is today. So, there is fixed economic value. Electricity is always getting cheaper. When money gets cheaper, prices rise. This is price inflation.

Pariah is no neutral term. Pariah means “outcast, persona non grata, leper, undesirable, unperson, nonperson.” Historically it referred to low caste persons in India. It’s a highly prejudicial and inflammatory term. It’s meant to encourage the cutting off of communications with that person and worse. It denigrates the person to whom it is applied and that raises the war temper, the idea being that it’s then right to treat that person with destructive violence and sanctions.

Instead, theyre only accustomed to the cheap and disposable shaving products that companies market. Im not sure when or why it happened, but the tradition of passing down the secrets of a clean shave abruptly stopped. Thankfully, this glorious male ritual is making a comeback.

Benefits of The Classic Wet Shave

Reduce costs. An 8 pack of your typical four blade cartridge razors can set you back over $20. $20! Thats $2.50 per cartridge. The cost of a double edged safety razor is no more than $.25. You can save some serious money switching over to a safety razor. Additionally, you can save money by using traditional shaving creams and soaps. A can of the chemically packed gel goop that most drug stores sell can cost you up to $5 a can and it doesnt even last that long and they dont give you a quality shave. On the other hand, traditional shave creams and soaps are made out of natural materials. While their up front cost may be a bit more than shaving gels, you require less product to get a proper lather. Thus, you end up saving more in the long run.

Merkur Futur MK 23C Lo... Check Amazon for Pricing.

Reduce environmental impact. Traditional wet shaving with a double edged safety razor uses less waste than shaving with cartridge razors. The only waste is a single metal razor blade and lather down the sink. Unlike todays razor cartridges, a double edged blade can easily be recycled. The tubes and bowls that most traditional shave creams and soaps are sold in produce less waste than those clunky non-biodegradable aerosol canisters that gels come in.

Better, more consistent shaves. Most men today walk around not knowing they have horrible shaves. Electric razors and the latest 5 blade contraptions irritate the skin more than needed, leaving razor burn, ingrown hairs, and redness. Shaving with a safety razor will eliminate the skin irritation and give your face a clean healthy look because youre just using one blade instead of several that chew up your face in order to cut your whiskers.

Youll feel like a bad ass. Its nice taking part in a ritual that great men like your grandfather, John F. Kennedy, and Teddy Roosevelt took part in.

The Tools

Safety Razor

Merkur-Razor Double Ed... Buy New $7.55 (as of 03:05 EST - Details)

Switching from a cheap disposable razor to double edged safety razor is like upgrading from a Pinto to a Mercedes. A safety razor is a machine. Its nice holding a piece of heavy, sturdy metal in your hand while youre shaving as opposed to a piece of cheap-o plastic.

You can find safety razors in a variety of places. First, ask your grandpa if he still has his. Chances are he does. If gramps doesnt have one, try checking antique stores. I found my 1966 Gillette Superspeed Safety Razor in an antique store in Vermont. I only paid $10 for it. If you dont have any luck there, stop by eBay and do a search for safety razors. Youre bound to find a few there. Finally, if buying a used safety razor doesnt fancy you, you can always buy a new one from the several companies that still make them. A highly recommended safety razor is from Merkur. They have several types to choose from at varying prices. Look to spend about $40 for a new safety razor.

Suggested Razors

Blades

Porteru2019s Badger Sh... Check Amazon for Pricing.

You can choose from a variety of different blades. Each blade has a unique sharpness and cutting ability. Experiment with different kinds until you find the ones you like.

Suggested Razors

American Personna. You can find these in most drugstores. Theyre usually marketed as generic brand blades. Theyre pretty forgiving for the first time user.

Shaving Brush

If youve never used a brush during shaving, youre in for a treat. A brush helps hydrate the shaving cream in order to form a thick rich shaving lather. Using a brush to lather up helps get the shaving cream up under each whisker which results in better, smoother shaves. Plus, it just feels nice on your face to lather up with a brush.

Brushes are made out of two types of animal hair: boar and badger. Boar bristles are stiffer than badger bristles and hold less water. Boar hair brushes are also cheaper. You can find a boar hair brush at Wal-Mart for about $4. If you really want to have a nice shaving experience, splurge and buy a badger hair brush. Badger brushes create more lather and it feels a lot nicer on your face. You can pick up a nice badger brush at any Crabtree and Evelyn. If you dont have a Crabtree in your area, try Amazon.

My spirit seeks approval; encouragement; the chance to share my skills with other teachers. Even better than these things, is proof, subtle or obvious, that my students have changed in response to my teaching or modeling. Sometimes I am lucky enough to notice new ways in which my students view or respond to the world around them.

Last week…the weather was fine and my students and I were ready to travel, with a couple hundred other 5th and 6th graders, to a distant town where we would attend a Disney On Ice show. The night before I had “played mother” and shopped for snacks and beverages, which I packed and brought along for my charges.

At last everyone was seated on the correct bus and we were ready to leave the school — backpacks, coolers, and picnic baskets loaded. The drivers of the several busses started the engines just as I muttered to myself, “Darn! I forgot my book.”

(Now, I have often explained to my students how much I hate to go anyplace without a book for I cannot stand to waste time when I could have been reading. I did not think they had even been listening. Was I ever wrong!)

I did not even realize that my comment was audible until two students immediately started to wail, “I forgot my book, too!!” Before I could stop them, they leaped to their feet, and rushed off the bus, heading into the school. I decided to follow and get my book, also, for by the time I could catch them and order them back to the bus — we could have our books!

Zoom! They ran into the building and headed in different directions — one to a locker and one to my classroom. That was soon followed by a dead run back to the bus. Whew! We had made it! The busses began pulling out.

I had just regained my seat when the Harry Potter reader began chewing out those kids who had stayed behind, “Why didn’t YOU go get a book?! You know it’s a shame to spend time staring into space, when you could very well be reading a good book. How can you just sit and do nothing?!”

I prepare for yet another clash between my values, and those of

the public educational system, I could not miss the irony of tonight’s

newspaper headline, “MEDICAID FORECAST IS GRIM WITHOUT MAJOR CHANGES.”

The article points out that doctors wait years for 14 cents-on-the-dollar

reimbursements for important medical services rendered; that the

Michigan Medicaid caseload has grown by 162,000 people since 1999

with no sign of leveling off; that “there are fewer dollars available

to cover health care for Medicaid patients.” Even Michigan’s Democratic

Governor-elect Jennifer Granholm has stated, “Universally, people

have come to me and said, ‘Medicaid is broken. It needs to be fixed.'”

(The Associated Press, 11-25-2002)

I

could help Ms Granholm understand how widely the floodgates have

been thrown, but I doubt that my voice would be heard. The aspect

of Medicaid with which I deal is this: public schools are encouraged

to believe that special education teachers provide medical services,

and so public schools are filing claims with Medicaid. These pseudo-claims

are actually being paid, and the always-welcome monies are rolling

into the school districts  while cardiac surgeons wait years

to get paid for real medical services to Medicaid patients.

I

presently face an open threat of disciplinary action because I refuse

to believe that I am a medical provider, and I refuse to fill out

claim forms. Furthermore, I openly and strongly state my belief

that such claims are fraudulent and serve to ""double-dip""

the taxpayers. However, the educational establishment will not allow

itself to recognize the lack of logic behind this “special education

equals medical services” scam. The ""call of the money""

beckons.

I

have been instructed to note and detail every contact I have, with

any general education teacher, who also works with any of the students

on my caseload, who qualify for Medicaid:

LST:

$$$$ “Hi there, Mr. Science. The time for the Individual Education

Planning Committee (IEPC) meeting for Mary has been changed to

after school. See you then.” $$$$ (note 1/4 hour of service time

plus 11 hour meeting?)

LST:

$$$$ “Hi, Miss Artclass. How is Freddy paying attention this morning?

Ummm….that’s nice.” $$$$ (note 1/4 hour service time?)

None

of these encounters, brief or long, are medically related, or serve

medical purposes, yet I am being ordered to bill Medicaid for them.

In fact, I have been ordered to over-bill, just in

case Medicaid decides to under-pay. The exact wording

of the principal’s memo is, “Only one service coordination activity

can be approved per student per day. Document all services rendered

on the MedBill form. Medicaid covers one service per day and five

per twenty days. It is suggested that you write seven or eight in

case a few get rejected.” (October 21, 2002)

I

sat in the principal’s office, trying to be nice, borrowing from

Bartleby, the Scrivener, “I would prefer not to.” (My thanks to

John Taylor Gatto for the suggestion.) I tried explaining that I

could not, with good conscience, file claims that would double-dip

the taxpayer; that the taxpayers were already paying me to check

up on Freddy and Mary, and should not have to pay double for the

same moment-in-time.

When he asked if I was prepared to accept any repercussions for

my refusal to obey, I pointed out that I have, without complaint,

accepted punishment during all the years that I have been refusing

to file these forms. I explained that the special education director

long ago decided that, since I do not file for any $$$$booty$$$$, my

students do not deserve any additional, or more current, technology.

I directed his attention to the Apple IIC and the no-name 286 PC

without printer  all the technology provided for my students

to use in my classroom. (Should my students be forced to suffer

and do without, simply because I have principles that others in

the profession lack?)

When

the principal asked what I would do if he absolutely insists that

I file the claims, I explained that I have already had U.S. Representative

Dave Camp’s northern area director visit my classroom to hear my

concerns about ""Special Education & Medicaid."" I explained

that my next step would be to file a written complaint with the

U.S. House of Representatives and any other agencies I feel appropriate.

In the likely event that I will end up taking such action, I will

also file complaints will the U.S. Attorney General; with Governor

John Engler; with Governor-elect Jennifer Granholm; and with the

Michigan Attorney General.

Just

as a point of interest, I mentioned the confrontation and this principal’s

determination to push me into violating my own conscience, to our

union rep. I was not asking for help, but the MEA rep decided to

meet with my principal without notifying, or including, me. Following

that meeting-minus-me, this fellow-teacher said that the principal

had convinced him that since “all the other special education teachers

are doing it” and since the amount of work necessary to complete

the forms did not appear to be out-of-line, that the union’s position

would be that I should do as I have been told.

Ah,

I would prefer not to….

740078,"Deficits Make You Poorer

by Rep. Ron Paul, MD by Rep. Ron Paul, MD

Most Americans are vaguely aware that Congress has run up huge deficits in recent years, but the numbers involved are so large that it’s hard to grasp what our government’s indebtedness really means to us as individuals. The total federal debt is quickly approaching $$8 trillion, courtesy of an administration that borrows roughly one billion dollars every day to pay its bills.

Ultimately, the U.S. government will either repay its debts or default on them. We need only look at the Argentine debt crisis of 2001 for an example of what happens when a government fails to make even minimum payments to creditors. The Argentine economy virtually collapsed, and the value of her money tumbled. This is something most Americans cannot fathom, especially a political class that mistakenly thinks it can’t happen here.

Repaying trillions of dollars will not be easy, however. Interest payments alone already consume nearly 10% of the annual federal budget, and Congress shows no sign of abating its spending appetite anytime soon. In fact, present spending rates will produce single-year deficits of $$1 trillion in coming years unless the public finally gets fed up and demands an end to it.

When the federal government spends more each year than it collects in tax revenues, it has three choices: It can raise taxes, print money, or borrow money. While these actions may benefit politicians, all three options are bad for average Americans.

Deficits mean future tax increases, pure and simple. Deficit spending should be viewed as a tax on future generations, and politicians who create deficits should be exposed as tax hikers. The federal government still consumes more of the private economy than it ever has except during World War II, despite the administration’s anti-tax rhetoric.

Deficits mean more monetary inflation. Deficit spending necessitates the creation of more fiat dollars by the Federal Reserve to keep the government afloat. Congress knows it can always fall back on the Fed money machine, which of course encourages more deficit spending. It’s a vicious cycle that ultimately makes every dollar you have worth less.

Deficits mean more borrowing overseas, which threatens U.S. sovereignty. Never before has the American economy depended so much on the actions of foreign governments and central banks. China and other foreign creditors could in essence wage economic war against us simply by dumping their huge holdings of U.S. dollars, driving the value of those dollars sharply downward and severely damaging our economy. Every dollar the federal government borrows makes us less secure as a nation, by making America beholden to interests outside our borders.

The economic situation today is reminiscent of the 1970s. The economic malaise of that era resulted from the profligacy of the 1960s, when Congress wildly expanded the welfare state and fought an expensive war in southeast Asia. Large federal deficits led to stagflation — a combination of high price inflation, high interest rates, high unemployment, and stagnant economic growth. I fear that today’s economic fundamentals are worse than the 1970s: federal deficits are higher, the supply of fiat dollars is much greater, and personal savings rates are much lower. If the federal government won’t stop spending, borrowing, printing, and taxing, we may find ourselves in far worse shape than 30 years ago.

If you don’t have these, however, you will need to do it the appropriately-named ""hard way"", which brings up one Big Important Difference (BID) between us busted-out lowlife dimwits and the millionaires: We spent our money on pure gluttonous consumption, and had a wonderful time for a surprising number of years by virtue of racking up suffocating amounts of debt, whereas millionaires got their millions from profitably (as in compounding the money borrowed from a bank) investing their money in productive, profitable businesses, like making money by making things, or by mining things, or making money merely handling whole oceans of money, or making money by running this towering, engulfing deluge of money created by the evil Federal Reserve through some Wall Street scam, con job, bamboozle or 401(k), or in any of the rest of the gigantic financial services industry which produces, as best I can remember instead of researching it to find out, about 40% of all the profits made in America.

You no doubt noticed that I surprisingly did not use an exclamation point to emphasize such a huge, glaring fact that is destroying this country with some silly, low-IQ, pie-in-the-sky crap about how investing all your retirement money in the stock market is such a good idea when in fact — in fact! — it is a mathematically a guaranteed — guaranteed! — loser for the vast majority of trusting, gullible and embarrassingly ignorant people who are stupid enough to think that putting all their money, and their entire financial future, into the general stock market is a ""good idea"" despite a complete lack of successful historical examples, common sense and the mountains of evidence to the contrary, when, alas, it isn’t, as the evidence had already proved, so it’s weird anyone would do it.

Anyway, I remember when I found out that investing long-term in stocks is a Big Time Loser (BTL) for the vast majority of people, and a Small Time Loser (STL) for almost everybody else.

For me, it was the Five Stages of Shock. First, I was in denial, then, in the Second Stage, I was angry, then I was depressed, then I was angry again, then more angry, and then violently angry and scared out my Mogambo Freaking Mind (MFM), where I remain today.

And it’s especially bad when dividends from owning stocks are taxed so highly. We’re the highest taxers of dividends in the world!

Forbes magazine posted a blog by Austin Johnson on the new changes in taxes on dividends. The top corporate rate on the dividend is now 39.6%. The recipient of a dividend, if in the top tax bracket, is taxed at 39.6%, too, plus another 3.8% (the new Medicare tax), for a whopping combined tax rate of 65.8l%!

And if you just stupidly add up the tax rates, it comes to an 83% tax! This 83% tax rate is both highly shocking and, unfortunately, a ridiculous and useless concept, except as evidence that I have no idea what I am talking about, as if anyone needed more evidence of that! Hahaha! Come on!

But what else can people do, except buy stocks, with all the trillions and trillions of new dollars being first created by the evil Federal Reserve and then spent by the government? All these tons and tons of new dollars, busily working their economic way down winding, wending paths through an economy’s worth of manufacturers, miners and farmers, workers, middlemen, retailers, owners and shareholders, and government itself, all of whom always have to wonder ""What to do with all this money rolling in, and how can I get some more of it?""

Miracles do happen. I was astonished when President Bush granted my request for an interview. The truth is that I had almost forgotten making the request. As a matter of course in journalism you cover your bases, asking for all sorts of things that you don’t expect to get. The theory is that lightning can always strike. So when the current administration came into office I made the usual petitions at State to talk to Condoleezza Rice, at Defense for the SecDef, and so on. It was pro forma.

Then my phone rang in Guadalajara. It was the White House press office telling me that Bush would see me. At first I assumed that it must be a joke. After all, I was semi-retired, no longer with major outlets in Washington. In the news racket we have large egos, but at bottom we know that officials don’t care about us, only about our publications. If a chimpanzee worked for the New York Times, any president would talk to it. And I had been critical of Bush in my web column. Why ? It didn’t make sense.

Finally it dawned on me. Years back, when Bush was governor in Texas, I had worked as the Washington editor for Richard Cabeza Productions, a now-defunct news service based in Austin. I wrote some puff pieces on Bush, suggesting that he had presidential timber, and we gave him the Richard Cabeza Award. This was a twelve-dollar mahogany plaque that the Press Secretary throws in the trash, but the news service gets a form letter of thanks from the White House to put on the wall.

I surmised that Bush, getting a lot of bad press about the wars, remembered that Richard Cabeza had praised him, and just wanted to hear a kind word about himself. We forget that politicians are human.

Anyway, I flew into Reagan National after changing planes in Atlanta. On final into Reagan, the Potomac shone in the sunlight and I could see wind surfers at the Washington Sailing Marina. I caught a cab to the Old Executive Office Building next to the White House — the Wedding Cake as it is known for all of its ornate columns — and went through security. A Secret Serviceman escorted me to the Oval Office, irreverently called the Oral Office since the Clinton Administration. I didn’t know what to expect but, what the hell, presidents were good copy.

President Bush was sitting at his desk with a heavy wool scarf around his neck. He looked — tired I guess is the word. He was a bigger man than I had expected, with an athletic cut to his shoulders, but he looked exhausted.

He said hello and got up to shake my hand. I indicated the scarf and asked whether he was well.

It’s, you know, the windows aren’t sealed too well. Sometimes there’s a draft. I alwys try to avoid the draft. I am the Decider. I need to be healthy for the country.

Yes, Mr. President. I understand. It wouldn’t do for the president to have a cold. Your responsibilities are heavy I don’t want to take up too much of your time, sir. If I may, I’d like to touch on the War on Terror. Would you mind answering a few questions for my readers?

Certainly, Fred. I think a free press is important for a country that doesn’t have terror. That’s what America is, a country that doesn’t have terror. All those other countries, the bad ones, they do have terror. They hate us because we’re free. That’s why — when the Decider talks to the press I have friends in the press you know — when he talks to them, one on one, in a group, that’s what keeps us free. The public ought to be informed, except about things it shouldn’t know.

Yes, Mr. President. The polls show that a majority of the American people believe that the war in Iraq is a failure, and want to bring the troops home. Yet you have said that you will not pull out even if Laura and your dog are the only ones who support the war. Is this an accurate statement of your views?

Yes. Democracy is what makes us strong, not terror. My job — the people elected me — twice — what people think doesn’t matter. Democracy isn’t about polls and what people think, it’s about freedom. From terror. Americans want to finish the job, even if they don’t want to. That’s what the public has to understand. What it wants. That’s why we have press conferences is this great country of ours.

As the interview continued, I was pleasantly surprised to find that President Bush was more articulate than I had expected.

Yes sir. Now, some critics have said that America is becoming a police state, that the government is too authoritarian. Would you comment?

You can’t have freedom unless people do what they’re told. Freedom isn’t free. I’m a War President. I have to decide. That’s why we have to get the job done in Iraq, not cut and run. If we pull out, we won’t be there anymore.

Some commentators say that victory is not possible. Would you characterize them as too pessimistic?

Yes, they are very too pessimistic. We are making progress, not instant — in life you can’t get everything at once, except some things, but progress in Iraq and in that other place.

Afghanistan, sir?

That’s it. Dick Cheney tells me the Afghans want nuclear weapons — those can do mass destruction, you know — we can’t let Al Quaida destroy our freedom. And Dick says we’re starting to have democracy in Iraq too. That’s what elections are for, to have democracy. If there’s a message I could give to people everywhere, that’s what America is about, democracy in Iraq. The Iraqis have to learn that democracy isn’t optional.

Finally, sir, what do you say to those who accuse you of dissimulation?

Fred, when I was in the Air Force in Texas, where I learned to keep America free, and not have terror, dissimulation was part of our training. It’s what — some other countries are free but — dissimulation is what America stands for. Our dissimulators were just like real airplanes. The buttons worked like real buttons.

I thanked him for his time and left, chastened. The Secret Service quickly passed me on to Pennsylvania Avenue and I walked into Lafayette Park to reflect. The press had led me believe that the President was less impressive, less informed than I had found him to be. As I rode the subway to my hotel on Upper Connecticut, I thought of the tired man in his scarf, and thought that maybe Richard Cabeza Productions, obscure though it had been, had a better grasp of reality than the New York Times.

Its predictions did not come true, of course. Yet the document is still cited by the global warming industry, as if it had not been just another propaganda piece.

It is nice that the Washington Times went back and looked at it. We forget how much money the government has spent over the last decade to promote this theory.

In 2003, the average temperature of the earth had not gone up for five or six years. Today, it has been 17 years. But the global warming crowd still pretends that we are facing a crisis. Al Gore is still taken seriously in these circles.

This would be an indirect subsidy to China, which ignore the theory and uses coal to grow its economy.

The theory that what men have done has raised the earth’s temperature has been rejected by over 31,000 American scientists. See for yourself. But the media refuse to report on this fact. This information would undermine faith in the Party Line.

George Bush now has the dubious distinction of the lowest approval rating of any President since Richard Nixon. ABC News reported that 33% of Americans think Bush is doing a good job. Conversely, 67% of Americans disapprove of his activities in office, primarily as a result of the never-ending American occupation of Iraq. One would imagine that if 67% of Americans disliked something they might try to change it. After reviewing some activities on the anti-war front over the last few days, one would be horribly mistaken for imagining so.

Bobby Muller, president of Veterans for America, spoke at the University of Pennsylvania Wednesday night. Muller has spent the last 40 years of his life in a wheelchair after a bullet severed his spine while he led his Marine platoon in Vietnam. In his talk Muller highlighted the idea that when the American war in Vietnam started to deteriorate, the Administration widened its theater to include Cambodia and Laos. He predicts a replay will occur in Iraq. An American attack on Iran is just a matter of time. In his words, ""The war with Iran is on the conveyor belt.""

For those of us who have been paying attention, Muller argued nothing new. However, coming from a wheelchair-bound combat veteran, his talk resonated more poignantly than all the vacillations from our elected officials. Muller drove home his main point with a raised fist and shrieking tone. ""Kristol, Wolfowitz, Perle, Feith, you name the neocon who urged us to invade Iraq. There is only one reason why they did so — none of them have ever seen combat themselves. I have fought in battle and have the scars to prove it."" The saddest part of the evening resulted from my realization that only 15 students and faculty witnessed his moving performance.

Perhaps the pollsters have horribly misjudged Americans’ opinion on the prosecution of this war. On a campus of roughly 20,000, fifteen (15!) bothered to attend a talk on a topic that supposedly 67% of them are annoyed about. Maybe the wintry mix of snow and cold kept the Quakers from attending. Such an excuse falls flat when the speaker arrives in a wheelchair. Apathy reigns among the faculty and student body at the University of Pennsylvania.

Last weekend’s peace march in Washington, DC illustrated this same apathy on a national scale. In a country of 300 million people, 67% or 210 million of whom oppose the American occupation of Iraq, somewhere between 30,000 and 400,000, marched for peace in the nation’s capital. The Captain and Tennille would draw a bigger crowd if they decided to reunite for one last tour.

Skeptics never accept poll results at face value. Yet talking amongst friends and colleagues one gets the impression that a large percentage of the population has had it with this war. Unfortunately, such dissatisfaction does not prompt Americans to action in 2007. I have seen dog owners yell at their pets with more emotion than I have seen anyone argue against the occupation of Iraq. The pollsters should add an asterisk to their findings on the disapproval for the war currently hovering at 67%*.

* Disapprove but don’t really care either way. Certainly won’t do anything about it. And what’s that guy in the wheelchair so pissed off about?

225218,"In the age of Obama, we’re going to have to get used to the new zeitgeist in Washington, and in the media: the perpetual high moral dudgeon of contemporary liberalism. While the Bush administration had its own style of moralizing — the rhetoric of “liberation,” the idea that we were doing the people of Iraq a favor by invading and occupying their country — the Obama crowd is much more sophisticated than that, and, simultaneously, more vulgar. On the one hand, they are all up in arms about torture, and the lawless treatment of the Guantanamo inmates, and on the other hand the prospect of a much wider “war on terrorism” — extending not only into Afghanistan and Pakistan, but the ring of ‘stans that encircle the new battlefield, — doesn’t seem to bother them in the least.

Amid hosannas from liberals, Obama declared an end to torture, and promised to close the Guantanamo facility within a year. This has been the signature issue of the left-blogosphere, and the estimable Glenn Greenwald led the way, with his relentless exposure of the pro-torture would-be appointees to top positions in Obama’s CIA. It’s too bad, however, that Glenn’s fellow progressives haven’t followed his lead on other issues, such as the war crimes engaged in by Israel in the Gaza Strip.

Guantanamo is a symbol of the Bush years that has to go, for a number of reasons — one of which is that we don’t want to have to lock up captives from the Afghan front in that infamous penitentiary. This would give the war we’re planning to fight in Pakistan the moral taint of the Bush years, and implicitly acknowledge that Obama’s Afghan “surge” is merely an escalation of Bush’s war.

In his remarks to the U.S. State Department on Thursday, President Obama made it clear that our policy of relentless military aggression in the region, far from being over, has barely begun.

In the real world outside the U.S. Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, Barack Obamas pledge to close Guantánamo and scrap the military commissions (the system of trials for terror suspects that was established in the wake of the 9/11 attacks) has provoked a rare outburst of frenzied media coverage.

With no concrete plans announced by the President-elects transition team, pundits and off-the-record officials of all political hues have stepped in to fill the void with speculation about the significance of the remaining 255 prisoners, some shrill demands for legislation endorsing preventive detention, some equally shrill warnings that robust techniques will be needed in the future to deal with captured terrorists, and a range of opinions about whether the Guantánamo prisoners regarded as a genuine threat to the United States (estimates range from several dozen prisoners to around 80) should be transferred to the U.S. mainland to face trials in federal courts or in another brand-new system.

Some of these opinions are genuinely troubling, and reveal the extent to which the governments fear-filled war on terror rhetoric of the last seven years has permeated the U.S. psyche. Proposals to create new legislation authorizing preventive detention, for example, actually seek to justify much of what the Bush administration has been doing at Guantánamo, and it beggars belief that citizens in a civilized society founded on the rule of law could attempt to justify imprisoning people not for what they have done, but to prevent what they could conceivably do in future.

The proposal is doubly disturbing because the governments assertions that some of the prisoners may be dangerous comes not from evidence that can be tested in a court of law, but from intelligence reports that may or may not be reliable, and from hearsay and confessions  made by other prisoners, or by the prisoners themselves  that may have been produced through the use of torture or other forms of coercion, or through bribery (a well-chronicled rewards system for prisoners regarded as cooperative).

In addition, calls for robust techniques to deal with terror suspects captured in the future are clearly influenced by the Bush administrations arguments that prisoners seized in the war on terror constitute a threat of a kind never encountered before, and that this threat justifies its attempts to redefine torture, and its endorsement of the use of torture by U.S. forces. For the record, torture, as defined in the UN Convention Against Torture (to which the U.S. is a signatory) is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person, and not, as the U.S. administration claimed in its notorious Torture Memo of August 2002, an act producing pain which is equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.”

Those endorsing greater latitude to deal with terror suspects in the future have presumably forgotten the extent to which the administration has belittled the intelligence agencies skilled interrogators, who contributed to 107 successful terrorist prosecutions in U.S. federal courts without resorting to the use of torture, and its disdain for the psychological techniques enshrined in the Army Field Manual, which not only prohibits the use of torture, but of any kind of physical violence. Both, however, have a proven track record of success, unlike the torturers, whose activities constitute war crimes, however much the Bush administration has attempted to disguise them, and are also morally corrosive and counter-productive, producing, at best, ripples of truth in a sea of false confessions, with no practical way of separating fact from fiction.

Much of this has been confirmed by Dan Coleman, a senior FBI interrogator who worked on several high-profile terrorism cases before the 9/11 attacks. Coleman is on record as stating that people dont do anything unless theyre rewarded. In an interview in 2006 with the New Yorkers Jane Mayer, he acknowledged that brutality may yield a timely scrap of information, but is completely insufficient in the longer fight against terrorism. You need to talk to people for weeks. Years, he explained.

When it comes to proposals to establish a new trial system for terror suspects, those putting forward such ideas have obviously failed to scrutinize the failures of the system conceived by Dick Cheney and his close advisers in November 2001. Thrown out by the Supreme Court in June 2006, the commissions were revived by Congress later that year, but have struggled to establish their legitimacy, primarily because the government-appointed military judges are empowered to accept evidence obtained through coercion, to prevent all mention of evidence obtained through torture, and to blur the distinction between the two, and also because, as I reported at length in a previous article, a growing body of evidence indicates that the entire system is rigged, with Pentagon representatives who are supposed to be impartial actually taking their orders from the heavily biased Office of the Vice President.

It remains to be seen how this chain of command  which pivots on the role played by retired judge Susan Crawford, the Commissions Convening Authority, and a close friend of both Dick Cheney and his chief of staff David Addington  will survive the transition to the Obama administration, but enthusiasts for the creation of another brand-new system should really take on board the sustained opposition to the commissions that has been mounted from within.

Those who have become implacably opposed to the system are not only the military defense lawyers, who have been prepared to sacrifice their careers in defense of justice, but also Col. Morris Davis, the former chief prosecutor, and several former prosecutors, including, most recently, Lt. Col. Darrel Vandeveld, who turned from being a true believer to someone who felt truly deceived by the system, when he discovered that evidence vital to the defense was being routinely withheld in the case of Mohamed Jawad, an Afghan teenager accused of a grenade attack on U.S. forces in December 2002.

In the meantime, while enthusiasts for a new trial system indulge their largely abstract musings, the reality of the commissions themselves continues to confound reality, as those in charge of the process persist in behaving as though it is business as usual.

On the eve of the presidential election, the failure of the commissions to deliver anything approaching justice was demonstrated when Ali Hamza al-Bahlul, a self-confessed member of al-Qaeda, received a life sentence for conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism, which is supposed to be served in total isolation at Guantánamo. Al-Bahlul was convicted after a disgraceful one-sided show trial in which, because of the ill-defined rules governing the commissions, he was allowed to score what was effectively a propaganda victory for al-Qaeda by refusing to mount a defense.

Since then, the commissions have stumbled on as though nothing changed with the elections on November 5. On November 17, the chief judge, Marine Col. Ralph Kohlmann, who had been overseeing the meandering pre-trial proceedings for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other men accused of involvement in the 9/11 attacks, announced his immediate retirement, scuppering any possibility that the commissions flagship trial would take place before the Bush administration leaves office.

At a hearing in September, Kohlmann had admitted that he was due to retire in April 2009, prompting Mohammed to ask him to disqualify himself from the case, on the basis that he might inappropriately rush the proceedings. Any kind of rush is now completely out of the question, of course, and instead, as Lt. Cmdr. James Hatcher (the lawyer for one of the accused, Walid bin Attash) explained, Kohlmanns departure means that a new round of pretrial hearings [will] be required and the new judge [will] be forced to reexamine earlier rulings, which will make an already complex case even more complex.

The departure of Kohlmann, a no-nonsense operator who has been involved in the commissions since December 2005, will certainly not make the trial systems work any easier, especially as his chosen successor, Army Col. Stephen Henley, has shown more patience with defense attorneys than his predecessor (as the Miami Herald described it), and was, at the time of his appointment, the only judge to have ruled that a major part of the prosecutions evidence in one case  that of Mohamed Jawad  was inadmissible, because it had been extracted through the use of torture.

Jawads trial is scheduled to begin on January 5, 2009, but the day after Henleys appointment to the trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his alleged co-conspirators, he struck another blow to the prosecution in Jawads case by ruling that a second confession, made in U.S. custody the day after his Afghan confession, was also inadmissible, partly because, as the Associated Press described it, the U.S. interrogator used techniques to maintain the shock and fearful state associated with his arrest by Afghan police, including blindfolding him and placing a hood over his head. As Henley explained in his ruling,

The military commission concludes the effect of the death threats which produced the accused’s first confession to the Afghan police had not dissipated by the second confession to the U.S. In other words, the subsequent confession was itself the product of the preceding death threats.

Elsewhere in the commissions, developments in two other cases also failed to advance the trial systems legitimacy. In the case of Ibrahim al-Qosi, a Sudanese prisoner arraigned on November 19, the major claim against him  that he was responsible for al-Qaedas payroll in Khartoum, before Osama bin Laden and his entourage moved back to Afghanistan in 1996  has been dropped by the government, and all that remains are claims that he worked at an al-Qaeda compound from 1996 to 1998, that he fought as an al-Qaeda mortar man near Kabul from 1998 to 2001, and that he sometimes worked as a driver and bodyguard for bin Laden.

Moreover, al-Qosis civilian lawyer, Lawrence Martin, has a take on his clients role, which, for the government, must sound uncomfortably similar to that of Salim Hamdan. A Yemeni, and one of seven drivers for bin Laden, Hamdan has just been repatriated to serve out the last month of the meager sentence he received in August, after his military jury threw out the conspiracy charge against him, accepting that he knew nothing about the workings of al-Qaeda. At al-Qosis arraignment, Martin declared, Mr. al-Qosi, far from being a war criminal, was a cook, adding, He was not even a cook for bin Laden, but a cook for a compound where bin Laden was sometimes a visitor.

The other arraignment on November 19  that of Mohammed Hashim, another Afghan prisoner  was even less justifiable. Hashim was charged in June with spying for al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and conducting a rocket attack on U.S. forces, even though he was, at best, a minor Afghan insurgent. As in the cases of two other Afghans (in addition to Mohamed Jawad), it is difficult to work out how the administration construes these charges as war crimes. His case is complicated by the fact that his publicly available testimony  which is sprinkled with implausible references to his knowledge of the 9/11 attacks (via a member of the Northern Alliance, the implacable enemies of both al-Qaeda and the Taliban), his supposed relationship with Osama bin Laden and purported links between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein  suggests that he either has mental health problems, or has dreamt up the biggest lies possible to secure more favorable treatment.

Despite all these dubious developments, the most worrying sign that the commissions continue to operate in a parallel reality also came on November 19, when Col. Lawrence Morris, the chief prosecutor, announced that charges against Mohammed al-Qahtani, which were dropped without explanation in May, were to be filed again, and that charges against five other prisoners, which were dropped last month, would also be filed again in the near future.

The case of Mohammed al-Qahtani is one of the most shocking in the whole of Guantánamos long and ignoble history. Regarded as the proposed 20th hijacker for the 9/11 attacks, until he was turned away by immigration officials in Orlando, Florida, al-Qahtani was apparently being questioned by the FBI with some success (through the old-school techniques favored by Dan Coleman), when the Pentagon, in the fall of 2002, grew impatient with the FBIs results.

After securing approval from Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld for a range of enhanced interrogations techniques, al-Qahtani was interrogated for 20 hours a day over a 50-day period in late 2002 and early 2003, as Time magazine revealed in an interrogation log (PDF) made available in 2005. The techniques used  beyond the persistent sleep deprivation  included extreme sexual humiliation and forced grooming (shaving his hair and beard), and he was also threatened by dogs, strip-searched and made to stand naked, and made to bark like a dog and growl at pictures of terrorists. On one occasion he was subjected to a fake rendition, in which he was tranquilized, flown off the island, revived, flown back to Guantánamo, and told that he was in a country that allowed torture.

In addition, as I explained in my book The Guantánamo Files, The sessions were so intense that the interrogators worried that the cumulative lack of sleep and constant interrogation posed a risk to his health. Medical staff checked his health frequently  sometimes as often as three times a day  and on one occasion, in early December, the punishing routine was suspended for a day when, as a result of refusing to drink, he became seriously dehydrated and his heart rate dropped to 35 beats a minute. While a doctor came to see him in the booth, however, loud music was played to prevent him from sleeping.

Until Col. Morris made his announcement, it had been widely presumed that the charges against al-Qahtani had been dropped because  unlike the interrogations in the secret CIA prisons in which Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other high-value detainees were held, which can be excluded from their trials  the details of al-Qahtanis interrogations are not only publicly available, but were declared to be degrading and abusive by a Pentagon inquiry in 2005 (PDF).

However, in the parallel world of the military commissions, where the Bush administrations attempts to redefine torture are clearly still embraced with enthusiasm, none of this seems to matter. Announcing his intention to charge al-Qahtani again, Col. Morris declared, as the New York Times explained, that prosecutors had decided there was independent and reliable evidence that Mr. Qahtani had been plotting with the Sept. 11 hijackers.

Col. Morris also declared his intention to file new charges against the five prisoners whose charges were dropped in October, which is almost as bewildering. When the charges against Noor Uthman Muhammed, Ghassan al-Sharbi, Jabran al-Qahtani, Sufyian Barhoumi and Binyam Mohamed were dropped, it was widely assumed that this was because their prosecutor, Lt. Col. Vandeveld, who had just testified for the defense in Jawads case after turning against the government, had more revelations about the machinations of the prosecutors that would undermine their cases. This may well be true, especially in relation to Binyam Mohamed, a British resident who was sent to Morocco in 2002 so that proxy torturers could spend 18 months extracting a false confession from him regarding his role in a non-existent dirty bomb plot.

Mohamed is currently involved in legal wrangling over evidence of his rendition and torture in courts on both sides of the Atlantic, and it is, therefore, yet another sign of the commissions detachment from reality that Col. Morris is planning to file new charges against him. What it demonstrates above all, however, as with the case of Mohammed al-Qahtani, is that Barack Obama will need to act swiftly and decisively after January 20 if he is to demonstrate that, under his administration, the use of torture  and of confessions obtained through torture  will no longer be tolerated.

by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis

The three Muslims prisoners who killed themselves this weekend in George Bush’s tropical gulag at Guantanamo renewed world attention on this despicable violation of human rights and American values. It would be rewarding seeing some of the neo-fascists who cooked up the Iraq War sent to cool their heels there, including the idiot San Diego Congressman who claimed prisoners were very lucky to be there since ""they never had such good food in their lives…they even get chicken."" But the prize for idiocy and stupidity goes to Rear Ad. Harry Harris who dismissed the suicides — a frightful sin in Islam — as being ""an act of war against us."" Right you are, Harry, never trust any of those sneaky Muslims!"" Ever wonder how Germans could cheerfully justify their WWII concentration camps? Just as Admiral Harry and the Pentagon.

Just when we thought things could not get worse abroad, along comes ret. Captain and Senator John McCain who is urging the US to send more troops to Iraq. Obviously, he learned nothing from Vietnam — this from the man who would be president.

This week, court proceedings in Canada will begin for 17 young Muslims arrested last week and charged with a dazzling series of plots and crimes, including, it seems, blowing up Parliament in Ottawa, kidnapping and beheading the prime minister, and bombing major public buildings in downtown Toronto. These nefarious plots were all hatched in the wide open on the internet, where police and spooks were watching. Rather than ""Canada’s 9/11,"" as it has been billed by the hysterical press, it all sounds like a bunch of amateurish, would-be Muslim Rambos who got carried away in on-line chat rooms with fantasy jive-talk, and were likely egged on by a police agent provocateur to order ammonium nitrate to make a bomb. The whole thing reeks to high heaven and was likely a piece of political theater designed to show know-nothing US Congressional Republicans, who have been screaming that Canada is a nest of al-Qaida terrorists, that concrete action is being taken. More to follow, stay tuned. In the remote 1950’s, the big scare was ""Reds Under Our Beds!"" Today, it’s ""Muslims Under Our Matresses!""

~ William Shakespeare, King Henry V

Those who defend warfare tend to see it only as an abstraction, a game pitting strategists from opposing collectives against one another in furtherance of contrived objectives. The ugly details of orchestrated butchery and torture are to be suppressed, lest persons of humane sensitivities become upset and demand a cessation of the game. But facts have ways of insinuating themselves into the most carefully devised schemes, causing the sordid nature of warfare to move from the abstract to the concrete. When this occurs — as it did in the My Lai massacre or, more recently, at Abu Ghraib — the political establishment is quick to look for scapegoats or explanations that do not implicate war itself. To the state, the professed ends of any given war are both irrelevant and fungible: it is the war system that requires protection.

One thing I found annoying during the Vietnam War years was the hostility directed by some anti-war activists to individual soldiers. I was opposed to that war — as I am to all wars — but I thought there was something cowardly about those who focused their anger on the soldiers rather than upon the politicians and the political establishment that manipulated the atrocities of warfare. Clearly, many war critics did direct their attentions to the system itself, but too many chose to concentrate their animosities upon the veterans rather than the architects of such villainy.

One sees this same moral cowardice in those Republican politicians who are calling for the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld over his flippant remarks to a soldier in Iraq, who complained about a lack of adequate equipment for their protection. In the face of increasing hostility to the war from both American civilians and soldiers, three Republicans — Trent Lott, Susan Collins, and Chuck Hagel — decided it was time to offer up Rumsfeld as a token sacrifice, rather than proposing the impeachment of President Bush for his pattern of lies, forgeries, and other deceptions that fomented the war. That Lott and Hagel — who voted ""guilty"" in Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial for lying about his relations with Monica Lewinsky — could don moral blinders for the more sinister lies of George Bush, reflects the cravenness of people who take a stand on ""principle"" only when it is safe to do so. Such people are akin to the ""animal rights"" advocates who berate Beverly Hills matrons for wearing fur coats, instead of confronting ""Hells Angels"" motorcyclists for wearing leather jackets.

The ""pecking order"" of an institution works in both an ""up"" and ""down"" direction. A sergeant will be sacrificed for the good of a general, a general for the benefit of a secretary of defense, and the latter for the sake of a president. If the initial level of scapegoating is not sufficient to end the criticism, one proceeds upward to successive levels in the hierarchy until it is perceived that the wrong has been rectified.

My words should not be misinterpreted as a suggestion that the soldiers of any war are not responsible for their acts. Neither am I ignoring the fact that many American soldiers have engaged in unpardonable atrocities against unarmed civilians, whether in Vietnam or Iraq. Each of us is responsible for the consequences of our actions for one simple reason: we are individually in control of our energies. A soldier who participates in the systematic killing of others is accountable for what his behavior has produced because he is the one who acted.

That said, however, I am far less interested in browbeating teenagers who, whether as conscripts or volunteers, decide to partake in the excitement of war. For millennia, politically-structured societies have conditioned their young men to look upon war as a glorious and noble undertaking; an expression of heroic sentiments; a source of meaning to life that allows you to ""be all you can be.""

Such attitudes are so deeply engrained in the culture that relatively few parents have seen fit to question their sons’ expected role in the war system. I recall fathers, during the Vietnam War years, expressing shame that their sons chose to depart for Canada rather than accept their ""obligation"" to be conscripted into the war machine. In the feminist-inspired insistence that women not be deprived of their ""equal"" right to be blown to pieces in some foreign land, daughters will also become incorporated into this state-serving mindset. That parents can accept such twisted thinking, and can love the state more than they do their own children, must rank near the top of the list for moral degeneracy!

Politically-structured societies wallow in lies and, in so doing, tear apart the fabric of decent social behavior. War, by its very nature, is sociopathic, as are those who plan for and execute the systematic slaughter of millions of persons. The idea of a ""just"" or ""moral"" war is so palpably absurd as to make even its suggestion a basis for questioning the sanity of its advocates. War makes ""heroic"" and ""honorable"" that which, if done privately, would render one a despicable criminal. We rightly condemn the serial killer who murders ten or twelve victims, while rewarding those who plot the political murders of hundreds of thousands with high political office or the Nobel Peace Prize!

War dehumanizes people — soldiers and civilians alike — and, for this reason, I have never understood the willingness of parents to allow their children to become part of such a dispirited, hostile, life-destroying system. I can understand how a teenager — whose limited life experiences are not sufficient to see what is implicit in warfare — might fall for the heroic imagery that gets reinforced in computer games. I do not understand this child’s parents — with many more years of awareness — not protecting him or her from this force that devastates the lives even of its survivors.

Why are so many war veterans — particularly those who saw deadly combat — unwilling to relate, even to their families, what they went through in wartime? Why do they not openly brag of their exploits, as do older men in recalling the athletic accomplishments of their youth? And why, knowing of the brutalizing nature of the war system, do parents who would not allow their sons to join an urban street-gang, take pride in their children being given over to the likes of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice, and neocon schemers, to be exploited and disposed of as best suits their arrogant temperaments?

It has been encouraging to observe, in recent months, the emergence of an apparent awareness among many American soldiers of the insanity of the war system, particularly as it has been playing out in Iraq. Soldiers have refused to obey orders that would send them on life-threatening missions; others have spoken out about the lack of adequate armor and protective equipment; still others have questioned the national purpose and/or morality of their participation in the killing of innocent people, particularly children. A number of soldiers have brought a lawsuit challenging the continuation of their service beyond the original commitment. Not surprising, National Guard officials announced that enlistments have fallen well below anticipated levels.

The issue of ineffective armament has become a focal point for the disaffection of so many soldiers, who complain of having to scour dumpsites in search of old armor plate with which to refurbish their combat vehicles. It is open to question whether the government’s indifference to the plight of these soldiers was best reflected in Rumsfeld’s aforementioned disdainful response to questioning, or in the Army’s court-martialing — and imprisonment — of six reservists for removing scrap metal and bullet-resistant glass from abandoned vehicles in order to augment their own. Rush Limbaugh — who has fashioned a lucrative career out of missing the point on just about every issue — saw fit to criticize the soldier’s inquiry of Rumsfeld not on the merits of the question, but on the ground that a member of the media had given him the question to ask! In such an atmosphere of rampant disregard for the well-being of the troops, I half-expected Rumsfeld to drag out the old ""duck-and-cover"" strategy by which American school-children — in the early Cold War — were advised to protect themselves in the event of a nuclear attack!

Perhaps the most interesting news story involves a Pentagon report that more than 5,500 Army or Marine Corps servicemen have chosen to desert rather than go to Iraq. Like their Vietnam War counterparts who avoided the draft, a number have gone to Canada. I suspect that Limbaugh and the FoxNews war-whoopers will attribute these mass-desertions to ""cowardice"" on the part of the soldiers involved. But if they took the time to read or listen to these men — instead of dismissing their interests — they would discover otherwise.

One young man, Pfc. Dan Felushko, began his military training shortly after 9/11, and was prepared to fight in Afghanistan. But when he discovered there was no connection between the 9/11 attacks and Saddam Hussein, he questioned his participation in a war he believed to be wrong. He then fled to Canada. ""[N]obody should make me sign away my ability to choose between right and wrong,"" he said, declaring the contract he had signed with the Marines to be ""a devil’s contract.""

A recent high school graduate, Brandon Hughey, joined the Army believing that the war against Iraq ""was necessary if they did have these weapons, and they could end up in our cities and threaten our safety."" He was prepared to die, he said, ""to make America safe."" But when the truth about Iraq’s alleged ""threat"" became known, ""[i]t made me angry, because I felt our lives were being thrown away as soldiers."" Echoing the sentiments of the Nuremburg principles, Hughey stated: ""[p]eople should have a right to say u2018I’m not fighting in that war. That’s an illegal war. . . . I’m not going.’"" He, too, left for Canada, adding ""I have to say that my image of my country always being the good guy, and always fighting for just causes, has been shattered.""

Patriotic types — who see no further than beyond the fringes of their flags — have always been quick to condemn those who adhere to their deepest principles. Like the members of a crazed lynch mob, they fail to see dissenters as the protectors of the values that make a society decent and productive. It has been America’s loss, and Canada’s gain, that men who insist upon the inviolability of their principles have been driven from the country. There is no more important time in the life of an individual or a nation than wartime for men and women to follow the bumper-sticker advice to ""question authority.""

The life-sustaining value to insubordination is most clearly revealed in the face of death. As Samuel Johnson stated, ""when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully."" It is unfortunate that most of us wait until our lives are threatened to energize our consciousness, rather than seeing the dangers implicit in the prior behavior of our revered systems.

An example of how the questioning of authority saved a person’s life was reported to me a few weeks ago. I was speaking with a woman whose friend was working in a WTC tower when one of the planes hit. She immediately headed for the doors and stairways to get out, but was told by her supervisors and colleagues to ""stay where you are,"" that everything was going to be all right. This woman responded: ""are you crazy? Can’t you see what is happening, here?"" Disobeying her bosses, she fled the building to safety. Her coworkers who stayed behind all died when the building collapsed.

I would like to meet this woman, as well as the many young men who, over the years, have chosen expatriation as the price for living a principled life. Perhaps in their eyes I will see the reflection of the values that led my ancestors to leave their European homelands for the opportunity to live as free and responsible human beings owing their lives to no earthly powers.

The American political establishment — whose interests transcend Republican and Democratic party lines — seems as intent on pursuing its violent ambitions for world domination as did ancient Rome, prior to its collapse. The consequences of such an undertaking will be rendered all the more troublesome by the unwillingness of most Americans to ""just say no!"" to the narcotic of state power. Still, there is some hope for the future when a remnant of humanity realizes that their physical and spiritual survival are to be found in being masters of their own lives.

Perhaps, in the example of the woman at the WTC, the rest of us may discover that our lives depend not on fighting authority, but on walking away from the crumbling structures in which we are expected to remain.

462115,"Amendment IV, the Bill Of Rights of the US Constitution:

“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath of affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”

Tyranny comes on gentle cat’s paws. The fiery Spirit of Freedom must wither away within a once free people before it can be “transcended” by the opportunistic demands for “Security.” All tyrannical regimes begin their encroachments upon the liberties of the people in darkest secrecy and one small step at a time. Free people will not be stampeded into forsaking their precious freedoms, but they can be lured and coaxed and lied into drifting one fatal step at a time into the iron cage of tyranny, especially when they are terrorized in times of warfare or other calamities. But after many years of growing accustomed to the new definitions of ancient laws, the lies about “protecting freedom” by eliminating it, and the other pains of the iron cage, the secret tyrants become more open in taking greater leaps into “The New Freedoms” and “The New Security Measures” which hide the iron cage from the more ignorant. This is the fateful moment for any people. If they do not immediately recoil in vast outrage against the more blatant usurpations, they are lost and begin the fatal plunge into despotism now hidden only by the incessant propaganda campaigns from Big Brother about the Evil Ones threatening to take over the world and seeking to destroy their way of life.

This was true in the time of Peisistratus in Ancient Greece, in Rome in the century of the tortured death of the “res publica” (The Spirit of the Republic) and the rise of the Caesars, and in the modern seductions of the peoples of Russia and Italy and Germany into their iron cages by the communists and the fascists and the fascist Nazis.

We Americans have been lured and lied and terrorized into periods of totally secret tyranny many times, beginning in the Civil War, and ever more rapidly and fatally in each war since then. The pattern is very obvious.

Presidents secretly usurp powers to fight wars. After the wars the people discover the tyrannical usurpations and try to root them out, but each bout of tyranny leaves their Spirit of Freedom and their other defenses against tyranny weaker. Some of the tyrannical measures become redefined as “necessary” for “national security in the modern world” and are left in place and quasi-legalized by fictitious additions of legislation to the Constitution which are themselves hidden acts of tyranny (since The Constitution to which our ancestors agreed allows only Amendments to change it, a fact denied by the tyrannical usurpers of The Constitution). We have been drifting ever faster into an utterly immense totalitarian police state which is the exact opposite of everything The Constitution was enacted to prevent (though no one at that time could even imagine the immense secret police powers the U.S. government now asserts over us and the entire world). We drift by a ratchet-up pattern: two steps into tyranny, one back and one pseudo-legalized; two steps into tyranny, one back and…on and on ever faster we rush into the iron cage as our new tyrants wrapped in the pseudo-Constitution launch new wars that create new terrors which they assert demand new tyrannical measures for national security.

We have now arrived at our fateful encounter with the bald face of total and blatant tyranny disguised only by the absurd lies about “the necessities of National Security.” We old Americans lived through the tyrannical wars of Truman, Eisenhower, JFK, LBJ, Nixon, Reagan, Bush I, Clinton and now Bush II, none of which were authorized by Congressional Declarations of War, the only way a war can be legitimized by The Constitution. (Ford and Carter were licking the wounds of the awful defeat of the U.S. in Vietnam, not launching great new “Wars of Liberation to make the world safe for Democracy.”) We have seen over and over again after many years of total secrecy that the U.S. secret police armies have grown ever more rapidly and usurped ever more powers. We have discovered to our dismay that we have been lied to over and over again to lure us into disastrous and ruinous wars used to justify ever more tyrannous usurpations. Each discovery led us to break out in vast outrage, as we did in the 1970’s after discovering the vast secret tyrannies of the FBI, CIA, DOD Special Ops, DIA, and all the other secret police and military armies. We even forced Nixon to resign in utter disgrace over some of his most extreme and clownish tyrannies known as “Watergate,” though almost all the vast tyrannies were perpetrated by the FBI, CIA, SS, DEA, and other secret police, not the tiny group of ex-secret police in the White House known as The Plumbers. Our outrage and demands led to new laws and cutbacks…but not to any significant dismantling of the secret police state in America. The CIA immediately launched a worldwide, secret program of “going off book” to hide even from the Senate overseers which continues to this day.

Bush I started the blatant attacks and annihilations of other states to put in place regimes which would “play ball” with him behind a Veil of Democracy. The earlier piecemeal and temporary invasions of Latin American countries over a whole century were transcended by the secret, total Air, Land, Sea invasion and annihilation of the Noriega Regime in Panama. Clinton annihilated the forces of Serbia and brought the people to the point of total starvation and death by disease by destroying their infrastructure. He continued this policy started by Bush I in Iraq. The U.S. secret overthrow of governments in the Muslim World which began under Truman in Iran and the occupation of Arab lands, especially Saudi Arabia, led to the attacks by Arab guerillas on 9/11. Bush II, Cheney and Rumsfeld (from the Nixon tyranny), and all of those who had been secretly developing a plan of permanent global empire for the U.S. in Rumsfeld’s DOD, immediately started invading and annihilating Arab nations to put in place the usual puppet regimes wrapped in an absurd veil of pseudo-democracy. Most of the American people, even most of the older ones who have seen all of this before, went along and totally supported it.

The growing defeat of the U.S. in Iraq has led to the same revulsion against the war we saw in Vietnam. Finally, people started coming out of the secret recesses of government to bear secret testimony to the vast war crimes of torture and murder and lies, lies, lies…

We are finally at the point at which some insiders are beginning to bear witness to the vast secret tyrannies always created by the government in these wars. Americans are not yet aware that the NSA, FBI, CIA, SS, DEA, ONR, DIA, and all the secret police have vastly expanded their secret spying on Americans by using the secret intelligence court to get rubber-stamped warrants to spy on any Americans they want to spy on. This is the tyrannical system created over recent decades, in total violation of the entire spirit and all letters of The Constitution, to give a thin veil of legitimacy to this tyranny which only the ignorant can believe. It is still hidden but is perfectly obvious to anyone watching closely. But the newest forms of Bush acts of tyranny  scofflaw redefining of war crimes and torture and much else by the Justice Department appointees of Bush, vast torture systems, war crimes, CIA murders by rockets from the heavens, sniper murders worldwide, and now NSA spying on Americans inside America are popping into public view like the giant tips of utterly immense icebergs of tyranny.

The response around the world has been more outrage against The Evil Empire, as America is increasingly called. Famous seekers of peace and justice like Nelson Mandela have been denouncing The American Terror. Now even the new Nobel Laureate in literature from Britain has denounced American tyrannies and terror before the entire world, but was almost totally censored by the Media in America.

But the response in America has been muted outrage by liberal journalists, ear-splitting support from the Bush Media, a vast Media Propaganda Campaign by the Bush people to “justify” these measures by claiming that the President as “Commander In Chief” has Constitutional powers to do all of this and more (as Cheney has put it blatantly), and much yawning in boredom by the American people concerned mainly about their SUV’s and new status symbols. The government and the Big Media have exploded in a massive campaign of Big Lies claiming American victory in Iraq is just around the corner, the U.S. is building a shining democracy in Iraq, the President has Constitutional powers to do anything he wants to do to defend American security, and on and on.

Bush and his Party have blatantly violated the clear, specific, and explicit laws of the Constitution as well as its entire spirit from the beginning when the Party members on the Supreme Court overturned the explicit laws on how a disputed election for President is to be resolved in the Congress. He now blatantly violates the once sacred Amendment IV of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution and blatantly asserts he has all the Constitutional authority to do that and all the rest and, by obvious implication, anything he decides to do.

This is not the Secret Tyranny I have lived through my entire life in America (since birth in Miami, Florida, January 14, 1937). This is Blatant Tyranny hidden only by the thinnest veil of Big Lies and obfuscation that only the very ignorant believe. We are literally staring in the face of the Neo-Fascist Tyranny in America (the giant police state ruling over giant corporations and other concentrations of power hidden only by a veil of empty democratic forms and dead rhetoric about freedom).

Bush II has proudly and defiantly thrown the gauntlet of Despotic Tyranny into our faces in this vast Media Propaganda Campaign this week. He is utterly convinced that the American people will stare into that face of Tyranny and applaud its dictates and spying and mass murders and tortures.

I fear he is right and I am certain this is a great turning point for us Americans, a moment of fateful and fearful commitment. If he is not now driven from office in utter disgrace by massive outrage at his blatant Tyranny, but instead is allowed to continue building his blatant Despotism, then the gravely weakened Spirit of Freedom will die in America, we will live on in the ruins of the empty forms of Constitutional Democracy, and the iron cage of the totalitarian secret police state will close ever more painfully and fiercely around us.

CongestEeze is another great product for helping with congestion and cough. Sinus Blaster is another customer favorite – this stuff tastes bad, but it works fast and helps relieve sinus and respiratory congestion.

Oregano oil kills lots of viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungus. It is really strong stuff – especially the kind that is at least 70 percent carvacrol.

If you are deficient in zinc or vitamin A, you will need to supplement these to get your immune system to do its job. Zinc deficiency is common in anyone who is stressed – a good sign of zinc deficiency is white dots on fingernails. Vitamin A is deficiency is not as easy to find. Beta-carotene is not true vitamin A – people with blood sugar problems or thyroid problems cannot convert beta-carotene to vitamin A and will be deficient. Cod liver oil is a great source of natural vitamin A.

We are also inundated with chemicals that are bodies cannot break down and eliminate.

227172,"Recently by Peter Schiff: The Dollar’s Lucky Streak

Advocates of government stimulus are running victory laps on recent developments that appear to vindicate their strategy. In particular, Paul Krugman compares the sluggish growth in Europe to the somewhat-less-sluggish growth in the US to prove that stimulus was more effective than austerity. Other economists are using government inflation measures to defend Fed Chairman Bernanke’s easy-money policy. The only problem is, they’re calling the race before the finish line is even in sight.

As usual, Paul Krugman overlooks basic economics (which, despite his Nobel Prize, is a science about which Mr. Krugman really knows very little). The reason stimulus is so politically popular is that it appears to work in the short-term. However, appearances can often be deceiving, as they are right now in the US. Stimulus merely numbs the pain of economic contraction, as the underlying trauma gets worse. Austerity might slow an economy down, but at least the wounds are able to heal. America has chosen the former and Europe the latter, albeit not quite as large a dose as needed. The fact that in the short-run Europe is suffering more than the US does not vindicate Washington’s approach. On the contrary, this is exactly what is to be expected.

What we’re seeing is like a race where each runner has a broken ankle. One has a coach who tells him to pace himself and not worry so much about winning this one, while the other coach gives his runner a shot of painkillers and tells him to give it all he’s got. Of course, early in the race, the doped-up runner is going to be flying down the track like nothing’s wrong, while the other runner might be limping at half his normal speed. However, when the drugs wear off, the sprinter is liable to collapse from pain, leaving the better-coached runner to limp across the finish line.

The true test is not the immediate effects of stimulus or austerity, but the long-term results. For that reason, Krugman’s conclusions are meaningless. The apparent success of stimulus simply results from spending more borrowed money on government programs and consumption. But don’t we all agree now that this is exactly what caused the financial crisis in the first place?

As far as inflation is concerned, a vindication of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is equally premature. First of all, it’s not that Quantitative Easing will lead to inflation; it’s that QE is inflation. Secondly, there is a lag between QE and rising consumer prices, so the jury is still out as to how high consumer prices will ultimately rise as a result of current and past Fed policy mistakes.

But even more fundamentally, it is absurd to look solely at government price measures, which are built to understate inflation, and conclude that QE has not already produced an elevated cost-of-living. For example, the 2.4% rise in the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Index in 2011 is more of an indictment of the accuracy of the index than a vindication of Bernanke. In fact, of all the ways the government purports to measure inflation, the PCE is perhaps the most meaningless, as it relies on built-in mechanisms like goods substitution to hide a lower standard of living. As an example of how this works, imagine you are used to eating farm-fresh butter but have to switch to cheaper but also less-healthy margarine from a factory; the PCE would say you are no worse off. That’s exactly why the Fed chooses to use this uncommon metric.

Mark Gertler, an economics professor at New York University, argues that even the Consumer Price Index, which rose at a more vigorous 3.2% in 2011, proves Bernanke’s critics wrong. According to Gertler, the CPI has risen at an average annual rate of 2.4% thus far under Bernanke’s tenure, significantly less than the 3.1% average under Alan Greenspan, and the 6.3% under Paul Volcker. However, Gertler overlooks two key points. First, the methodology used to calculate the CPI was much different during the Volcker era. If we still calculated the CPI the way we did then, the numbers would be much higher for both Greenspan and Bernanke. Second, given the huge economic contraction that has taken place under Bernanke, consumer prices should have fallen — significantly. The fact that they rose anyway indicates tremendous inflation.

Of course, the Fed’s ability to stimulate the economy with inflation only works as long as bondholders remain ignorant of its plan. For now, the seemingly hopeful news reports are giving the Fed cover to keep stimulating. As long as the market remains convinced there is no inflation, the Fed can continue to create it. However, once the effects are so pronounced that even the PCE can no longer hide them, the Fed will be in a real bind.

Think of our two runners again. Even after the race is over, the fellow who chose to dope up likely injured himself even further. He might have even ended his career. So, the early dash and the cheer of the crowd in that one race was clearly not worth the many years of misery he would incur in the future.

Regardless of what the triumphant Keynesians would have you believe, my analysis continues to be that the current combination of monetary and fiscal stimulus is driving us toward disaster.

How do property owners deal with mob violence? If defenders face prosecution for defending their property, and the police and national guard fire tear gas canisters and rubber bullets, which do not slow down the looters, then both personal safety and private property are left without meaningful support.

The rioters set fires, as they always do. Loot and burn for justice! I remember the rioters’ cries in Watts in 1965: “Burn, baby, burn!” The law-abiding citizens were at the mercy of rioters.

The looters and rioters in Ferguson have sent a message: the state is impotent when it comes to protecting life and property. Yet these two protections are basic to the theoretical justification for the state’s possession of a lawful monopoly of violence. The state of Missouri visibly shares this with looters. “Sorry; there is nothing much we can do.” The looters knew this, and they acted accordingly.

There is a fundamental law of economics: “At a higher price, less is demanded.” But modern Americans have been verbally assaulted for so long by the bullies in ghettos and their accomplices in the media that law enforcement agencies are today unwilling to hike the price on violence.

In the 1992 Watts II riots — the Rodney King riots — Korean store owners got guns. They stood their ground. They had no problem.

you haven't heard, the Phoenix metropolitan area is running low

on gas. Long lines of drivers with short tempers wind from the few

stations with the precious fluid. The media sends out small armies

of reporters and cameramen to further annoy those stuck in queues

said to last up to two hours. As usual the media inflames rather

than informs. They have turned a temporary shortage into a u2018crisis'

through their persistent caterwauling that agitated the driving

public to fill their cars, SUVs, and other vehicles to the brim

whenever possible. The media manipulated fear and caused a minor

panic, proving that as a propagandist, even the lowest form of journalist

can incite the mob.

Recently,

the web site of the local newspaper, The Arizona Republic,

showed an irate man yelling at station employees because the price

of a gallon of gas was $$3.99. He believed the gas price should be

lower. For him, and the rest of us, that price would be $$0.00 a

gallon. That's human nature.

The

station owner would love to sell it at $$1,000 or more a gallon.

That's human nature. Business prudence informing the market has

established the rates for a gallon, as of August 20, from $$1.99

to $$2.49. Given the circumstances this is not unreasonable.

They'll

never admit it, but those envious feelings are quite universal in

enterprise because greed drives transactions and is kept at bay

only by the market. The simple law of supply and demand is as set

in human transaction as the law of gravity is in physics. Virtue

often acts on greed to mitigate it, but in our secular society virtuous

elements are quickly disappearing because government has stepped

in and promised everyone it would punish the greedy and protect

the victims… if only the populace ceded more liberty for the chimera

of an all-encompassing u2018security' and u2018protection.'

The

truth is: the democratic mob wants something for nothing because

it believes it's entitled to it. Demagogues inflame the mob. Gas

line executives are duplicitous, station owners greedy, poor computers

victims, while the government will ride to the rescue.

The

Hillary-esque governess of Arizona, Janet Napolitano, a lawyer,

turned bureaucrat, turned politician, presented this view in a recent

news conference. She probably has never run a business in her life.

This socialista said in a recent press conference, ""Arizona

drivers deserve to get gas when they go to gas stations. That’s

not an unreasonable expectation."" We deserve gas? We merit

gas because of some inherent right? She speaks like a true socialist

who wants to inflame one group against another for the financial

benefit of lawyers who feed on this kind of meat in the various

courts in the nation and for the extension of government power in

the social and economic realms.

She,

the dull-witted media, and usual suspects of socialists from both

parties in the legislature believe the right course in this alleged

u2018crisis' is to go after u2018price gougers.'

""We

need laws on u2018price gouging,' the governess growled. Later she added,

“… I’m angry that the private sector, which is supposed to be

in charge of running gasoline into the Valley, doesn’t have its

act together to deal with a critical situation, so now the public

sector has to step in.""

When

she, or any politician says, ""the public sector,"" she

means government: more laws, more regulations, more bureaucrats,

more taxes or u2018fees.' While they try to soothe the mob's savage

breast with calls to punish u2018gougers,' politicians quickly rise

up to take more and more power, knowing the mindless believers in

democracy will cheer the ominous move.

What

is price gouging? Nobody knows, but one thing is certain: it's another

way for government bureaucrats to kick in the front doors of small

businesses and dip their vile hands into the tills of these generally

powerless people.

The

punitive redistributionist idea of anti-gouging laws inhibits business

and magnifies government; especially the policing agencies that

tend to become immune to elimination. These laws will require another

layer of government to sit atop the businessman's enterprise influencing

whatever he does by instilling fear in him. He will probably realize

over time that it's better for him to sell out or just close shop

than to continue as a legally-bound slave to a nest of bureaucrats

who have the authority to make his life miserable and to strip him

of his livelihood.

The

idea that bureaucrats can alleviate any ill real or imagined, such

as u2018price gouging,' is the political equivalent of faith healing

by quacks. The gullible pay the admission price, swoon at the charlatan's

tricks, and fall prey to the deception. The quack, though, gives

a better show and usually disappears over time; the former are with

us forever like allergies in springtime.

Yet,

the question of what is u2018price gouging' has not been answered. Check

out some u2018price gouging' laws from around the country and you will

notice one constant. It is the metaphysical element of u2018unconscionable.'

Though lawyers may squabble over this term and give it some distorted

meaning, it has no meaning to real transactions.

I

go to the gas station and wait in line. The large sign out front

tells me the price of a gallon of gas is $$10.00 a gallon. Still,

I wait and fill up my car's tank. The seller of the goods made me

an offer that I AGREED was fair at this time because I NEEDED the

product.

I'm

relatively happy that I have gas and temporarily have eliminated

the worry of running out.

Down

the road I see an owner, who apparently went insane, charging only

$$1.00 a gallon. My reaction? I kick myself for not taking a greater

risk, but realize that at least I have gas to get to the bar, the

ballpark, my girlfriend's home, and later to pick up my wife at

work. If I hadn't filled up on $$10 a gallon gas, I wouldn't be able

to pick up the wife!

However,

if I'm part of the mob crying out for vengeance I call the attorney

general and in my meekest, most pitiful voice cry, ""I've been

gouged! I DEMAND justice!""

Or

if I'm really inflamed by the unseasonable heat I go fetch a bat,

return to the owner, and beat him or his goods with it. Then I shout

at the TV cameras as I'm hauled away, ""Power to the people!

Vengeance is mine saith the mob!""

Both

scenarios, preferably the latter, in our victim hungry society makes

for easy news, unfettering the alleged journalist to do the real

work of hair combing, trouser crease straightening, calling friends,

stock quote checking, or the myriad of chores filling the days of

reporters in these End Times.

The

true nature of life in the world is transaction, every day, day

in day out, hour in hour out. In economic transactions, it is solely

based on two people-buyer and seller. It's not pretty, mostly not

involving sex. Broadcast of most transactions would send the most

ardent couch potato into a deep sleep if shown on the evening news.

u2018Crisis' sells; u2018shortage' sells; u2018price gouging' sells; but the

daily lives of most Americans do not sell advertising or newspapers.

But

the fact remains, whether or not the media and politicians like

it, if I don't like your price, I go elsewhere. If I can't go elsewhere,

I may accommodate my needs in a reasonable and rational way. Nobody

holds a gun to my head to pay an unfair price. The decision is solely

mine.

Most

people are like me, waiting for gas, willing, though not happy,

to pay the price to keep us off buses.

The

neighborhood gas station near my home had long lines on Monday,

August 18. By midafternoon the gas was gone. A station employee

told me, ""No gas till Friday."" Then yesterday I heard

that a shipment would be in for Thursday. I woke up at 4:00 AM,

drove to the station, filled my tank… no waiting. I went home drove

my other car to the station, filled the tank, again no waiting.

The price was $$2.39. On Monday the station's gas price was $$1.89,

or fifty cents more per gallon. I paid the price without kicking

the pimply-faced teen to unconsciousness or death. There were few

other drivers also filling up, yet with this largesse of petroleum

product none of us was smiling.

We

grimly faced the real world as the rational men we're supposed to

be. We might not like it, but we like it even less to be slaves

to the State.

On

Wednesday, I spoke with an employee of the same station. She said

that on Tuesday, the day following the lines, she had no deposits

for the bank. There were few customers coming in to buy sodas, chips,

ice, and other items usually purchased with the gas. My son was

one of the few customers on Wednesday. While the hysterics shout

about u2018price gouging,' few pay attention to the real costs the owner

must bear. With an erratic supply of gasoline, and the threat of

little more for the rest of the month, the owner must make the economic

decisions that impact his employees. Lay offs? Closure? Cut back

on hours? Will he win back any of his loyal customers? Will his

supplier squeeze him out of business during this shortage? Will

he be able to meet his own mortgage or pay on his other debts? These

factors weigh on the pricing decision. He did not enter business

to lose his shirt. Yet a cloud of mosquitoes alights on his shoulder

to watch every move.

Will

the Arizona Attorney General incited by governess Napolitano legally

lynch our neighborly station owner? Probably not. But the media

will sniff out some business owner, ridicule him in public, and

perhaps even destroy his business because his prices were u2018unconscionable,'

yet there were enough people who wanted and needed his product enough

to pay the price. They drove in, filled up, and left. They could

have driven on and waited. That's the free decision we still can

make in our market economy.

Will

we be able to make those decisions tomorrow? All bets are off when

government smells an opportunity to metastasize.

Pretty much every feature of the human body can be found, in some form or another, on other species. Opposable thumbs? Great for building and using tools, but apes have them, too. Even the giant panda has an opposable sesamoid bone that works like a thumb. Bipedalism? Helped us avoid direct mid-afternoon sun and carry objects while moving around the environment (among other possible benefits), but plenty of other creatures walk upright, like birds and Bigfoot. The human foot? Okay, our feet are quite unique, but every other -ped has feet (just different types), and they all work well for getting around. So, what is it that makes us so different from other animals (because it’s got to be something)?

What truly sets us apart from the rest of the animal kingdom is the human brain. Other animals may have brains big and complex enough to help them procure food, shelter, and water while processing and acting on basic sensorial inputs from the environment (“avoid obstacle” or “this smells like food” or “I am thirsty, where’s the water?”), but they do not share the human brain’s capacity for self-reflection and symbolic thought. It is the fleshy thinking mass of fatty furrows and gelatinous valleys sitting atop our spine that gave and gives us art, literature, architecture, agriculture, nuclear power, syntax, philosophy, advertising, society, this laptop on which I type this post, and the smart phone on which you read it. In short, our brains make us human. Without them, we wouldn’t be us.

I don’t know about you, but I enjoy being a human. I like contemplating my own existence, being entertained for hours by strange scribblings on layered sheets of dried and pressed wood pulp, and playing Ultimate Frisbee, and if I’m going to continue to enjoy those things, I need to protect my brain and keep it healthy. And if I want to enjoy myself on this planet and experience all it has to offer until I drop dead, I’m going to need as much brain function as possible (since, you know, the brain handles all that experimenting stuff) as I age. Luckily, fasting appears to offer three main protective and therapeutic benefits to the brain:

Fasting boosts neuronal autophagy.

I’ve cited this study before, but I’ll do it again because it’s central to the theme of today’s post: “short-term fasting induces profound neuronal autophagy.” Autophagy, or “self-eating,” is the process by which cells recycle waste material, downregulate wasteful processes, and repair themselves. Brain health is highly dependent on neuronal autophagy. In fact, a recent paper shows that deletion of an “essential autophagy gene” in the hypothalamic neurons of fetal mice resulted in metabolic derangement (more body fat, poor glucose tolerance) and impaired neuronal development. Another study shows that disruption of neuronal autophagy induces neurodegeneration. Simply put, without the process of autophagy, brains neither develop properly nor function the way they should.

Fasting increases levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

BDNF is a protein that interacts with neurons in the hippocampus, cortex, and basal forebrain (the parts of the brain that regulate memory, learning, and higher cognitive function — uniquely human stuff). It helps existing neurons survive while spurring the growth of new neurons (neurogenesis) and the development of synapses (lines of communication between neurons). Low levels of BDNF are linked to Alzheimer’s, and supplementary BDNF prevents neuronal death, memory loss, and cognitive impairment in an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease.

Fasting increases production of ketones.

Ketone bodies like hydroxybutyrate are famously neuroprotective, and fasting often induces ketosis.

Increased autophagy and BDNF and ketones from fasting sounds awesome, but do they manifest as actual benefits to neurological health? Let’s see what the research says.

No discussion of fasting and neurological health research is complete (or can even be initiated) without including Mark Mattson. Mattson, chief neuroscientist at the National Institute on Aging, has been releasing paper after paper on the neurological effects of intermittent fasting for the past dozen years, and he’s amassed an impressive body of work that suggests IF can induce neurogenesis and protect against brain injury and disease. In the following sections, I’ll discuss the evidence — from Mattson and other researchers — for the beneficial effects of fasting on neurological health across a spectrum of conditions.

Stroke.

The most common type of strokes are ischemic strokes (composing about 88% of all strokes) – cerebrovascular events in which a blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by a clot. Without blood, the brain can’t get oxygen or nutrients, and (often permanent) brain damage can occur. In an animal model of ischemic stroke, fasting upregulated BDNF and other neuroprotective proteins, reduced mortality and inflammation, and increased cognitive health and function. However, it’s worth noting that fasting was most effective against stroke in young animals, who enjoyed a four-fold increase in neuroprotective and neurogenerative BDNF. Middle aged mice saw a two-fold increase in BDNF, while older mice saw no increase. Post-stroke cognitive function had a similar relationship to age and feeding status; young and middle-aged fasted mice retained far more than old mice and fed mice. Fasted mice displayed lower levels of inflammatory cytokines, but this effect was also modulated by age. Overall, fasting increased neuroprotective proteins and decreased inflammatory cytokines in young and middle-aged mice, thereby reducing the brain damage incurred by stroke.

A historian by training, Woods is at his best when he debunks the great myths of the Great Depression. The Great Depression was not caused by the Hoover administration’s laissez-faire economic policies. To the contrary, Hoover’s “unprecedented interventions took the 1929 downturn and made it into the Great Depression.” This was then prolonged by FDR’s New Deal. Woods also discusses in depth the topic of money, covering clearly and succinctly the origin and nature of money, the gold standard, the money supply, inflation, deflation, the Federal Reserve, and how governments throughout history have monopolized the production and eventual destruction of the value of money. Woods gives his perspective on some cures to restore the economy to health: let firms go bankrupt, abolish Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, stop the bailouts, cut government spending, end government manipulation of and control over money, and put the actions of the Fed on the table for review — the institution “responsible for more economic instability than any other.” The message of Meltdown is clear: Government intervention in the economy is always part of the problem, but never part of the solution.

You may wonder why detoxification is so important. A few toxins here and there are not the issue. It is the accumulation of them over time because they tend to store in our fatty tissue because the body cannot eliminate them without some help. The fatty tissue we are talking about is not just that roll around the middle – it also a form of fat known as phospholipids that are found in significant quantities in our brain and nerves. This accumulation of toxins over time can cause serious degenerative problems.

Culligan WSH-C125 Wall... Best Price: $$10.19 Buy New $$24.50 (as of 07:15 EST - Details) How can you tell if you need to detoxify? I think if you are living in this day and age and eat conventional American food, you need to detoxify. The symptoms and signs of toxicity include fatigue, lack of energy, headaches, high blood pressure, allergies and sensitivities, excessive mucus production, sinus problems, and bronchitis. They can also include mood changes, joint aches, arthritis, autoimmune issues, skin problems such as eczema and psoriasis, forgetfulness and foggy thinking along with just not feeling good. If you have any of these symptoms, it may be time to clean up.

Many people ask where the toxins come from. They are everywhere – not to be paranoid or anything, but think about it. Much of our food is conventionally grown, meaning that they use chemical pesticides and fertilizers. To top that off, if they are processed in any way, they are treated with chemical additives to preserve texture, taste and shelf life. Our animals are also raised on conventionally grown crops and are fed hormones and sometimes highly processed food that is completely unnatural to their systems. These animals have the same trouble we do in eliminating unnatural chemicals – they store them in fatty tissues. The toxins you get from conventional meat may be the same ones that end up in your brain, prostate and breasts.

Transfats are another major source of toxins in the body. Transfats are unnaturally saturated fats that include shortening and margarine and are found in baked goods, snack foods, and fried foods. These transfats are used by the body for any kind of fatty tissue. Now again, we are not talking about the roll around the middle. There is a cellular membrane for each cell in the body that is made up of fat. If transfats are all that is available, then that is what the body uses. Cell membranes made from transfats are brittle and stiff and basically cause deterioration of the body at a cellular level – this is not good – it is a major source of problems associated with aging. It is also a huge issue with skin conditions. Most skin cancers have some relation to these transfats.

We also forget about the absorbability of our skin. Whatever we put on our skin goes into our bloodstream without being processed by our liver first. Many of our cosmetics and lotions have horrible chemicals in them and we don’t even think twice about the toxicity of them. Think about even Vaseline – also known as petroleum jelly. Yuck! Or baby oil – also petroleum based. How about nice substitutes made from olive oil and beeswax, coconut oil or sweet almond oil?

What is fiat money? It comes from “fiat,” which means a formal authorization or proposition or a decree. Synonyms are these: edict, order, command, commandment, injunction, proclamation, mandate, dictum, diktat. It is an arbitrary order.

The phrase “fiat lux” comes from Genesis 1:2: “Let there be light.”

Fiat money is the money issued by a self-proclaimed divine state. It rests on the premise of divine right: no higher appeal. It is the court of final appeal. In short, it is divine.

A free market money system is an operational system to which people can appeal to because it is not statist money. People use gold coins or silver coins to buy what they want. Or they use legal claims to such coins. The state is not in the “money business.”

No nation-state ever allows this. Every nation-state wants to be the highest court of appeal, especially in monetary affairs. Every nation-state claims legal sovereignty over money.

Any gold standard in which civil government is the defining agency is a pseudo-gold standard. It is a counterfeit. When you think “government-guaranteed gold standard,” think “counterfeit.”

WHEN MONEY DIES

In times of great crisis, money dies. The things that money could buy in normal times are not available at any price close to that which prevailed in normal times.

The Bible’s most famous example was the famine in Egypt under Joseph’s administration. We read that the money failed (Gen. 47:15). But there was another case.

And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass’s head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of doves’ dung for five pieces of silver (II Kings 6:25).

So revelatory are prices of the underlying social conditions that Elisha prophesied the end of a siege by forecasting a dramatic fall in prices: “Then Elisha said. Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, Tomorrow about this time shall a measure of tine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria” (II Ki. 7:1). Before it ended, silver did not count for much. Or put differently, they had to count out a lot of silver to buy anything worth owning. What was worth owning was food.

Normal pricing reveals normal times. When prices today are close to what they were yesterday, we can be confident that society tomorrow will be pretty much what it IS today unless something totally unforeseen happens. Rarely does it happen.

Money prices are indicators of broad social trends. Gold reached its highest price, denominated in U.S. dollars, the week before Gettysburg. On July 3. 1863, Lee’s army was defeated. On July 4, Vicksburg fell to Grant’s forces. The dollar price of gold fell the following business day and did not reach these heights for a century. The world believed that the Union would win the war, no matter what the South’s politicians and generals said in public.

What was the South’s leadership to say? “Well, that does it. It’s all over but the shouting. The North’s shouting. We might as well surrender now. Why continue this bloodbath? The Yankee dollar is up. Gold is down. Gold says we’re beaten. We might as well face it.” Had any politician said this, he would not have served out his term. Yet this was exactly what the South’s leaders should have said. They continued the bloodbath, yet the outcome was what the price of gold had projected.

All of this is to say that the price of gold, back in the days when governments tied their currencies to it, was a better indicator of social conditions than the speeches of politicians.

No matter what politicians want people to believe, if they preach good times while the price of gold is rising, the public would be wise to discount the politicians words. Free men make evaluations of the state of the world, and the price of gold reflects their judgment. So do interest rates. They can be wrong in their forecasts, but their forecasts are best reflected in these two market prices.

THE FOCUS OF ATTENTION

Why should gold be the focus of attention, the ultimate indicator? One reason is because it usually has been. When gold is not widely used as currency, silver has served the same function. These two precious metals are the most familiar indicators of underlying economic trends. People have learned after millennia that the purchasing power of gold and silver also reveals a great deal about social stability. When the price of either or both keeps rising, the world is alerted to nations underlying crisis. When the prices of basic commodities rise faster than the price of gold and silver, that society is becoming desperate.

Ludwig von Mises defined money as the most marketable commodity. For most of the last century, beginning in the early months of World War I, gold was legally severed from currencies. National fiat currencies have served as money. Also, bank deposits serving in lieu of paper money have become money. These deposits have multiplied. Today, economists are not sure exactly what constitutes money or how to measure it. There are numerous competing measures. Gold and silver rarely serve as money. But Mises’ definition remains accurate: money is the most marketable commodity. You can buy what you want: (1) immediately, (2) without offering a discount, and (3) without advertising. In this sense, money is said to be liquid. It is the supreme measure of liquidity. Inside a national border, gold and silver are no longer as liquid as what a solvent national government calls money. We must pay a commission to buy a gold coin or a silver coin. In this sense, gold and silver are not money. They are not the most marketable commodities.

This raises an interesting question: ls our era an anomaly? Are we living in a monetary new world order? Is this situation likely to persist? Or will we see a return of gold and silver as the most marketable commodities?

If men are at long last trustworthy, if politicians tell the truth, if central bankers can be trusted not to inflate whenever there is a recession, and if things continue to operate smoothly, then the modern world will have escaped the unsentimental constraints of gold. Gold will not again become money, except as an accounting device for settling international payments among central banks.

Yet this raises another question: Why do central banks stubbornly refuse to abandon the “barbarous relic,” as John Maynard Keynes derisively called it? If gold is not good for us little people to use as money, why is it good for central bankers to use in order to settle their accounts? If gold is just another commodity, why don’t central banks sell all of it that is stored in their vaults and invest the money in U.S. Treasury bills or some other nation’s interest-paying debt? What do they know that the public doesn’t know, and gold-hating economists don’t know?

There is an answer: central bankers do not trust other central bankers. They do not trust the reliability of civil governments. They know that when push comes to shove in the business cycle, other central bankers will crank up the printing presses. When this happens, they all want to be in gold. So should the rest of us. To keep their credit worthiness in a crisis, they have to own gold. So do the rest of us.

373551,"Every nation celebrates its founding day. Ours is the Fourth of July.

Canadians will not be celebrating the Fourth of July. This may have something to do with the fact that in December 1775, the United States of America, which did not actually exist yet, sent two invading armies into Quebec, which was French Canada, in the hope that they could persuade the French to secede. George Washington thought this was a good idea. It made perfect sense politically, because the American Revolution grew out of the taxes imposed by the British government to pay for the debts it had incurred during the French and Indian War, which had led to the surrender of Quebec to the British by the French government in 1763. That war was started by George Washington in 1754 at the Battle of Jumonville Glen.

The invasion was a failure. It was led by Benedict Arnold. Anyway, half of it was. His half was a strategic disaster.

Americans regard Benedict Arnold as a traitor. So do Canadians. Americans see him as a traitor because he switched sides. So do Canadians.

This is why the Fourth of July is not a holiday in Canada. It is merely July 4.

The Fourth of July was all about war and secession. It is all about avoiding tyranny at the hands of the British. You know. The way Canada suffered.

FALL-BACK CITIZENSHIP

If you have ever thought that there might come a day when you would leave the United States permanently, because of the loss of liberty here, have you given any thought to what country you would flee to?

For most American would-be expatriates, the list is short. First, most Americans want to go to some country where English is the primary language. Second, the ones who have given more thought to these matters want to live in a country in which there is a strong common-law position. Third, they want to live in a country where there is considerable education. Fourth, they want to live in a country that has economic opportunities.

They do not normally think of the Isle of Man.

Most of them think of Canada. They might go to Australia or New Zealand, but those nations are far away. A move to Canada would seem to be a lot less disruptive.

When Americans think of Canada, they think of the welfare state. That is because of the Canadian system of medicine. But with Obamacare looming, there seems to be no particular reason for choosing the United States rather than Canada as your place of primary medical care. Certainly, the distinctions between the two systems are growing vague.

Some taxes are higher in Canada; some taxes are lower. Canadians have this enormous advantage: if they live outside of the geographical confines of Canada, and they earn their income from outside Canada, they pay the Canadian government no income tax on this money. If they live in the Bahamas, they pay no income taxes.

The weather is cold in most of Canada, but you could always live in Vancouver, British Columbia. I used to live right across the border from Canada in northwest Washington State. The weather was great. Back then, real estate was relatively inexpensive on both sides of the border. Those were the good old days. In terms of climate, the border area of British Columbia is terrific. You do not get frozen in the winter, and you do not get broiled in the summer. Humidity is low.

734308,"Don’t trust banks to protect the money you’ve deposited? You’re hardly alone.

From a legal standpoint, the money you deposit in a bank no longer belongs to you. Instead, the bank owns it. You are merely just another one of their unsecured creditors. What’s more, in the event of future bank failures, the US government has now signed an international agreement confirming that it will not pay off depositors. Instead, it will force them to submit to a “bail-in” regime, like bank depositors in Cyprus experienced in 2013.

The bail-in scenario, on top of the lowest interest rates in 5,000 years, has led many bank depositors to make the entirely rational decision to withdraw their savings from banks. They’re taking the cash and storing it, often in a home safe. Indeed, sales of home safes are soaring worldwide.

Physical Gold & Silver in your IRA. Get the Facts.

This behavior deeply disturbs the powers that be. In response, they’ve imposed stricter and stricter controls on cash. I wrote about those controls a year and a half ago, and since then, it’s only gotten worse.

In the US, one strategy the government uses to discourage people from holding cash is a civil forfeiture. Under this Alice-in-Wonderland legal process, cops can seize your cash – or anything else you own – if they believe that it’s somehow connected to a crime… any crime. You don’t need to be convicted, accused, or even arrested for a crime to lose everything you own. SentrySafe Fire and Wa... Best Price: $$47.09 Buy New $$67.27 (as of 06:55 EST - Details)

Consider the case of Emiliano Gomez Gonzolez. During a traffic stop, Nebraska state troopers asked Gonzolez for permission to search his vehicle. During the search, the troopers found bundles of currency totaling $$124,700. Based on a dog sniffing narcotics residue on the cash, police seized all the money. This is hardly “proof” that the cash is the proceeds of illegal drug sales; more than 90% of US bills actually contain traces of cocaine.

Gonzolez contested the forfeiture in court. Prosecutors neither convicted nor accused Gonzolez or any of the other owners of the seized cash of any crime. Nor did the police find any drugs, drug paraphernalia, or drug records connected to the cash. Despite these facts, a federal appeals court upheld the confiscation of every dollar found in the vehicle.

Gonzolez was an exception because he fought the seizure of his cash. Most defendants don’t because the burden of proof is reversed in a civil forfeiture case. In a criminal proceeding, you have the right to be presumed innocent until a jury finds you guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.” If police seize your property in a civil forfeiture, it’s “presumed guilty.” It’s up to you to prove that it’s not associated with a crime. That’s a tall order and a big reason why 80% of forfeiture cases go uncontested.

The procedural rules governing forfeiture cases are also very complex. Only a handful of attorneys are familiar with them, and they charge accordingly for this knowledge. The last time I checked, I couldn’t find an attorney willing to help a client reclaim wrongfully seized property from police for a retainer under $$20,000. If you’re poor, like most victims of civil forfeiture, there’s no way you’ll be able to come up with the money to contest the seizure.

The biggest reason cops love civil forfeiture is that the seizing agency generally gets to use the seized property for its own purposes. It’s literally “policing for profit.” While each state has its own rules for what cops can buy with the money they confiscate, pretty much anything goes:

Milwaukee County sheriff’s invested $$25,000 in forfeited monies for “customer service training” from the Disney Institute.

Police in Bal Harbour, Florida, with an estimated 2014 population of 2,633, spent $$23,000 flying first class to Chicago, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles. On arrival, they drove in style in deluxe vehicles such as a Cadillac SRX and a Lincoln Town Car. The police department later spent $$7,000 on a banquet and $$21,000 on an “anti-drug beach bash.” AmazonBasics Security ... Buy New $$39.97 (as of 08:35 EST - Details )

Romulus, Michigan’s police chief used forfeited assets to buy a $$75,000 tanning salon for his wife. He spent another $$40,000 on marijuana, alcohol, and prostitutes.

A Texas district attorney spent $$267,449 in forfeited assets on travel expenses, including numerous junkets to casinos.

Another Texas district attorney treated his office and their spouses to Hawaii for a “law conference.” He paid for it with $$27,000 in asset forfeiture proceeds.

The sheriff of Camden County, Georgia, used $$90,000 of forfeited assets to buy a Dodge Viper for the county’s Drug Awareness and Resistance Education (DARE) program. He also paid prison inmates $$35,000 to build a “very nice party house” for himself.

Admittedly, a few of these purchases broke even the very lax rules for the permissible use of seized assets. For instance, in 2014, the former police chief of Romulus, Michigan, was sent to prison. He and five other officers allegedly embezzled more than $$100,000.

But it’s not just state and local governments that are getting in on all the fun. Federal law has authorized civil forfeiture since the dawn of the Republic more than two centuries ago. And it’s become quite profitable. The Department of Justice alone seized more than $$4.5 billion in 2014. It’s just one of many federal agencies with the authority to confiscate property under federal civil forfeiture laws.

That should come as no surprise. In 1989, the Supreme Court actually ruled the federal government has a legitimate financial interest to maximize forfeiture revenues. Since then, federal agencies have developed highly sophisticated techniques to do just that.

Trademark Home Diction... Buy New $$13.49 (as of 04:05 EST - Details) Take the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), for instance. Earlier this year, an investigation revealed that the DEA routinely carries out “data mining” of Americans’ travel information to build profiles of individuals who might be carrying large sums of cash. Using a nationwide network of travel industry informants, the DEA gives special attention to individuals who meet secret “drug courier” profiles, such as buying one-way tickets or purchasing their tickets with cash. Amtrak and airline employees who pass information on to the DEA are eligible for generous commissions if the tip leads to a seizure.

Over the last decade, the agency has seized at least $$209 million in cash from 5,200 passengers. In the vast majority of cases, the passengers weren’t arrested; they were given a receipt for the seized cash and sent on their way. For instance, of 1,600 DEA forfeitures in Los Angeles in the last 10 years, only one was in connection with a criminal investigation.

Are you outraged? You should be – and it’s probably about to get worse. President-elect Donald Trump has proposed a “Restoring Community Safety Act” that he claims will reduce “surging” crime in America’s cities. But the fact is that violent crime nationwide has actually been falling for the last 25 years. Given the love affair police at all levels of government have for civil forfeiture, it’s inconceivable that a Trump anti-crime bill won’t further unleash the forfeiture squads in America.

But there’s no law – yet – that says you can’t move a portion of your assets outside the US to countries that don’t have civil forfeiture laws (most don’t). Even if you don’t fit the “profile” for a civil forfeiture – and you probably do, because it’s so broad – you should seriously consider international diversification. A Plan B, if you will.

Today couldn’t be soon enough to begin putting it in place.

274663,"I have maintained in a number of articles over the past several years that no Christian — whether he terms himself a conservative, an evangelical, a fundamentalist, or a Bible-believer — has any business in the U.S. military, including the National Guard and the chaplaincy. Although the same goes for anyone else who names the name of Christ, I have always emphasized these particular Christian groups because of the unholy relationship that exists between them and the military. But what about American Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus? Would it be okay if they joined the military? And what about the members of the various cults and sects that abound in the United States? Is the military a good place for them? And let’s not forget about atheists, agnostics, infidels, witches, Satanists, and the irreligious. Should they be discouraged from joining the military as well? Should anyone join the military? Here are seven reasons why I think that no one, regardless of his religion or lack of it, should join today’s military. 1. Joining the military may cost you your limbs, your mind, or even your life. There is no end in sight to the Iraq war. Over 3,800 U.S. soldiers have been killed in Iraq. Many thousands more have been wounded. Hundreds of these have had limbs amputated. An increasing number of soldiers are committing suicide. Untold numbers suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Some soldiers will spend the rest of their lives unable to work or drive a car. Others will live out their days as physical and/or emotional basket cases. What makes you think that you or one of your loved ones will not be sent to Iraq or will emerge unscathed in body and mind? Don’t trust the recruiter who tells you that you won’t be sent to Iraq. They are getting so desperate for cannon fodder that they are blatantly lying to potential recruits. 2. Joining the military may have an adverse effect on your family. The breakup of marriages and relationships because of soldiers being deployed to Iraq and elsewhere is epidemic. Multiple duty tours and increased deployment terms are the death knell for stable families. It is devastating to a young child to be deprived of his father for months at a time. It is a national disgrace that we send single mothers in the National Guard off to war who must then leave their small children in the care of friends or relatives. Yes, I know they joined the military of their own free will, but it still shouldn’t be done. What makes you think that the military will never send you away from your family for an extended period of time? You know that the possibility exists, so why gamble with your family? And then, as if being away from your family wasn’t bad enough on you and them, some soldiers come home with such physical and/or mental problems that they are unable to return to civilian life. Debt, doctors, and divorce lawyers soon consume their finances. It is U.S. military families that are the unseen victims of the war in Iraq. 3. Joining the military does not mean that you will be defending the country. The purpose of the U.S. military should be to defend the United States. Period. Yet, one of the greatest myths ever invented is that the current U.S. military somehow defends our freedoms. First of all, our freedoms are not in danger of being taken away by foreign countries; if they are taken away it will be by our own government. It is not a country making war on us that we need to fear, it is our government making war on the Bill of Rights. And second, how is stationing troops in 150 different regions of the world on hundreds of U.S. military bases defending our freedoms? It is not the purpose of the U.S. military to change regimes, secure the borders of other countries, or spread democracy at gunpoint. The Department of Defense should first and foremost be the Department of Homeland Security. 4. Joining the military means that you will be helping to carry out an evil, reckless, and interventionist U.S. foreign policy. For many, many years now, U.S. foreign policy has resulted in the destabilization and overthrow of governments, the assassination of leaders, the destruction of industry and infrastructure, the backing of military coups, death squads, and drug traffickers, imperialism under the guise of humanitarianism, support for corrupt and tyrannical governments, interference in the elections of other countries, taking sides or intervening in civil wars, engaging in provocative naval actions under the guise of protecting freedom of navigation, thousands of dubious covert actions, the dismissal of civilian casualties as collateral damage, the United States being the arms dealer to the world, and the United States bribing and bullying itself around the world as the world’s policeman, fireman, social worker, and busybody. 5. Joining the military means that you will be expected to unconditionally follow orders. There will be no questioning of the purpose or morality of an order. You will often times not be in a position to know whether an order is in fact dubious or immoral. You will be expected to, without reservation, drop that bomb, fire that weapon, launch that missile, and throw that grenade, as well as kill people and destroy their property. Do you question whether that prisoner should be transported to some secret CIA prison to undergo “enhanced interrogation techniques”? Too bad. Do you question whether the United States should have troops in 150 different places around the globe? Sorry. Do you question whether the United States should launch a preemptive strike? Banish the thought. Do you question whether the United States should effect a regime change? Keep your mouth shut. But wouldn’t military effectiveness unravel if the troops didn’t obey orders? Let’s hope so. Every act of American military intervention was made possible because the troops blindly followed the orders of their superiors. If they had refused to do anything that was not related to actually defending the country, then there would not have been any overseas deployments, land mines buried, bombs dropped, preemptive strikes, or missiles launched. The result of this would have been not only less anti-American sentiment, but fewer terrorists, fewer dead foreign civilians, and fewer dead American soldiers. 6. Joining the military means that you will be pressured to make a god out of the military. Am I exaggerating? Here is a note I recently received from a veteran: Mr. Vance, I, perhaps, have some insights why soldiers or Christian soldiers do not refuse to fight. I enlisted in the Marines when I was 17. I went to boot camp 2 months after graduating from a Jesuit high school in 88. I served until 94. In that time I graduated from boot camp as Series Honorman, was meritoriously promoted twice, was platoon high shooter a few times, and volunteered for as much advance and rear party (so I could stay in the field) duties I could. At the time, I was not a Christian and worshipped the USMC. Boot camp was an interesting experience. They instill ones duty to first the Marines (before I went to combat, I made sure I had a good picture of me standing proudly in front of the Marine Colors) then your comrades. At the end of boot camp we would have done anything for the drill instructors and our comrades. There was a saying, ours is not to reason why, but to do and die. There are few people that have the where-with-all to go against this. Plus, the intellectual foundation required for resistance (which, even though I went to a Jesuit prep school, I didn’t have) is constantly attacked. The honor of our former Marines and duty to current Marines must be upheld. The attitude, when in these situations, is that you must make “them” objects. Otherwise you might hesitate and it could get yourself or your comrades killed. This attitude pretty much trumps everything else. Luckily, I got out, found Antiwar.com and then LewRockwell.com. Best Regards. SM Idolatry is certainly something that any non-religious person should be averse to. 7. Joining the military means that you may be put into a position where you will have to kill or be killed. What guarantee do you have that you will always be in a non-combat role? You are responsible for the “enemy” soldiers you kill as they defend their homeland against U.S. aggression. It may soothe your conscience if you attempt to justify your actions by maintaining it is self-defense, but it is hardly self-defense when you travel thousands of miles away to engage in an unnecessary and unjust war. You are responsible for the civilians you kill. Dismissing them as collateral damage doesn’t change the fact that you killed someone who was no threat to you or your country. You are responsible for every soldier and civilian you kill: not Bush, not Cheney, not Rumsfeld, not Gates, not your commanding officers, and not Wolfowitz, Feith, Hadley, Perle, Abrams, Tenet, Powell, Rice, and the other architects of the Iraq War. Bush and company will not be firing a single shot. You will be expected to do their dirty work and live with it the rest of your life. “Thou shalt not kill” is not just a tenet of the Judeo-Christian tradition; it is part of the moral code of every civilization, pagan or religious. Should anyone join the military? Certainly not today’s military. And until a major change in U.S. foreign policy occurs, not tomorrow’s military either. So be all you can be: Just don’t be it in the U.S. military.

Phoenix, AZThe Doomsday people are saying that we are about to have a Constitutional crisis and a showdown with the Obama Administration and the turncoats within Homeland Security. Are they really just paranoid and over-reacting?

There are those that proclaim this can never happen. They are in the ranks of supporters of Barack Obama. At one time the National Socialist Party also had wide support and admiration of most of the civilized world. That Partys leader was made our own Time magazines, Man of the Year. Some twelve years and 50 million lives later his supporters figured out he was a colossal mistake.

What does our future hold? Will like some have said there will be foreign troops from a Communist nation helping a rogue despot get Americans under control? I dont think any of us are really clairvoyant and can say for sure. Civil war is a reality at one time or another in every nation on earth and whats past is prologue.

The frightening signs are there. We have a President that has nullified the Bill of Rights and now has all the powers of Stalin or Hitler should he care to use them. This nation has never been more divided in any of our lifetimes. When was there ever a leader that did not abuse absolute power?

Our President has encouraged a class war with the Occupy movement. That movement lacks a cohesive direction or any discipline and may not impress anyone with their nebulous presence. With any luck we can simply turn out more criminals from our Congress and the Whitehouse with ballots.

In the meantime Homeland security has ordered some 450,000,000 rounds of small arms ammunition for use here at home. Just what do they have in mind?

But what if things went bad, and we face home invasions by government, with evacuation, concentration camp detentions or worse? Then wed have little choice if we wanted to live in freedom but to resist.

224853,"Recently by Gary North: The Most World’s Important Unanswered Historical Question: ‘WhatChanged in1800?’

“I seen my opportunities, and I took ’em.” ~ George Washington Plunkett (of Tammany Hall)

Oh, boy! A scandal among the rich  the very, very rich  and famous. Warren Buffett’s would-be replacement got his hand caught in the cookie jar. He is no longer in the running in the Buffett-replacement sweepstakes.

It seems that the fellow was on the fast track, along with three others, to replace Buffett. Buffett did not announce, “You’re fired!” He is not trying to replace Donald Trump on “The Apprentice.” He merely said the man has resigned. He did all this in a low-key way, unlike Mr. Trump’s style. Mr. Trump goes for the ratings. Mr. Buffett is a low-key fellow  kindly old Uncle Warren from Omaha, a man known for clever one-liners. “Your fired” is not clever.

As far as I can see, both Trump and Buffett know how to work the media, each with his own personal style. Whether their private lives match their carefully managed public personas, I neither know nor care.

What I do care about is the possibility that Congress will do something really destructive. That threat exists at all times, but especially when a scandal hits the media.

GAMING THE SYSTEM

It turns out that Buffett’s subordinate bought about $$10 million worth of shares in some firm that the rest of us had never heard of, but whose customers are loyal to it. Then the guy pitched Buffett on buying it for Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett took the advice, the stock went up 30%, and the subordinate sold his shares for a tidy profit: maybe $$3 million. Nice work if you can get it, and if you get it, tell me how.

The guy is dumb. Really, truly dumb. How do rich hot-shots survive when they are really, truly dumb? But they do.

This guy was not even street smart  not Easy Street smart, anyway. Here he was on the fast-track to stardom, backing up an 80-year-old geezer with an 87-year-old partner. The clock is ticking on both of them. All he had to do was outperform the other three hopefuls. He would then have become Omaha Sage II. He did not make it.

For about three million bucks before paying short-term capital gains taxes, the guy risked losing his shot. Hot-shots are not supposed to do this.

Why? Did he think he would not get caught? This is Buffett. This is the man who took Goldman Sachs to the cleaners in its time of need. Dumb. Really, truly dumb.

Buffett sent a letter to the media. He said that the hot-shot had resigned. In fact, he had resigned twice before, the letter said. Buffett assured the media, “Neither Dave nor I feel his purchases of Lubrizol were in any way illegal.” He also said that the hot-shot’s letter had said that his resignation had nothing to do with the share purchases. Wink, wink.

Buffett also assured everyone that he had known nothing about any of this. He also said that he had made the purchase on the man’s recommendation. He had been considering buying another firm’s shares.

In short, “You’re on your own, hot-shot. You deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I’m just an innocent bystander.”

The problem is, the poor schnook probably will deal with the SEC, which frowns on insider trading. If you doubt me, ask Martha Stewart.

I think he will beat the rap. He bought the shares before Berkshire Hathaway did. Buffett was not even considering buying the shares. So, legally, it was not insider trading. But even if it were, it would still be a bum rap.

INSIDER TRADING

The SEC prohibits insider trading. Insider trading is defined as making a profit based on information that is not available to all the owners of publicly traded shares. The inside trader buys or sells in advance of a public announcement regarding information that will affect the price of the shares. The assumption underlying this definition is simple: Accurate information should be treated as if it were a free resource. Everyone with ownership, no matter how small, in a publicly traded firm must have access to the same information at the same time, if this information can measurably affect the price of the shares.

This assumption is nuts. I mean it is off-the-wall ridiculous. It assumes that a business, which operates in terms of privately purchased and privately monitored information, must share this information with the public as soon as it becomes available. Can you imagine running any organization this way? Does any civil government operate this way? Of course not. But the regulators insist that publicly traded firms must not allow any shareholder with inside information to profit personally from this information until they all can.

From the point of view of management, this official corporate prohibition is good policy. It is close to impossible to enforce, but it is good PR. The policy lets investors operate in terms of an assumption, however naive: senior managers will not profit personally at the expense of share owners. But this should not be a matter of civil legislation. It is a matter to be policed by the owners of the company.

If the owners think that senior management is ripping them off, they can sell the shares. This should be obvious. It is not obvious to politicians.

If outside investors think that senior management has made itself vulnerable to outraged shareholders, they can offer to buy the shares from these existing share owners. They can take control of the firm, toss out the senior managers, and replace them with managers who abide by the corporate rule against insider trading.

So, what do we see? We see the SEC impose rules against outside buyers who try to do just this. The SEC forces these “predator” investors to report on what they are planning if they plan to buy a controlling interest in the firm. This gives the targeted managers time to mount a defensive campaign. It raises the cost of any take-over. Existing senior managers like this.

The SEC imposes the terms of trade as its lawyers see fit. Congress authorizes this agency to enforce what does not need any enforcing. Congress thinks SEC lawyers are more alert of practices that are bad for investors than investors are.

Economists usually assume that the people with the greatest self-interest to monitor what senior managers do are investors. Investors are the people with “skin”  their own money  in the game. Investors, not SEC lawyers, are the people who should vote to elect the board members who set the rules, approve internal policies, and hire agents to enforce the rules. Investors can sell the shares if they think the rules are being violated at their expense.

Do we really want to reduce sharp practices that inflict needless losses on investors? Then we should let investors decide how to police the firms whose shares they own.

Do most of the investors not care? Then why should the government care?

Do most of the investors think that setting up such rules and enforcement arrangements is not worth the money? Then why should Congress care?

Congress passed a law against insider training. Fine, says senior management. But to be fair, senior management insists, the government needs to pass a similar law to restrict predatory speculators from buying control. Congress complies. Not only is this law seen as fair, it increases Control by the government.

Who wins? Existing corporate management. By consenting to rules against insider trading by individual members of senior management, they all get protection from corporate raiders who might swoop in and buy up control.

THE MOB AND ITS GOONS

If you think America’s corporate management is paying protection money to Congress, you do not understand economic cause and effect. Corporate management is the Mob. It operates in terms of a system in which Congress serves as the enforcer, along with the SEC. Congress is not cleaning up the financial system, ethically speaking. The financial system is cleaning up by means of Congress.

There is a tendency for American males to think of life as an extension of the Corleone family. They think in terms of the slogans that either Brando or Pacino announced as principles of rational administration.

The Godfather series is closer to the truth of the government-business partnership than college textbooks are. The politicians are on the take. They are compromised. They act as though they are in charge, but they aren’t. Brando or Pacino called the shots, not the Senator who got caught in the brothel.

It was not the big banks that rescued the Treasury in 2008. It was the Treasury and the Federal Reserve System  an official agency of the Federal government  that rescued the big banks. Today’s million-dollar big bank bonuses are not sent to Congressmen. They are sent to the survivors of the bailout by Congress. The voters saw this coming in October 2008. Congress didn’t care.

When the Mob in a gangster movie sends out low-salary goons to collect protection money from store owners, we get the correct picture. Think of Congress as the goons. Senior management is the Mob.

When we watch “The Untouchables,” we think of Eliot Ness as the enemy of the Mob. He was, too, if by Mob we mean private interlopers making a killing (in both senses) during Prohibition. Ness arrested Al Capone on income tax charges. That tells us something.

Ever since 1791, when Alexander Hamilton got the Federal government to take over state debts, which his cronies had bought for pennies, and then when he got the Federal government to authorize a monopoly for a privately owned central bank, the Bank of the United States, the real Mob has been plucking the feathers of the public.

The goons are Congress and the enforcers in the executive branch. The victims are taxpayers and investors who think the goons represent them. The Mob is the corporate system that consents to a law against insider trading in order to gain protection from investors: new investors who are ready to buy shares at a good price from existing investors, so they can replace existing senior management.

ACCURATE INFORMATION IS NOT FREE

Let us return to the assumptions undergirding laws against insider trading. Accurate information should be treated as if it were a free resource. Everyone with ownership, no matter how small, in a publicly traded firm must have access to the same information at the same time, if this information can measurably affect the price of the shares.

Anything with a price is not a free good. It is a scarce good. That is the meaning of scarcity: “greater demand than supply at zero price.” There are few goods that are more valuable than accurate information.

In one of the most profound economics books ever published, Thomas Sowell demonstrated in 400 pages that knowledge is not a free good. Knowledge and Decisions (1980) is one of those rare books that you can re-read every few years and find new insights or old ones that you forgot.

Sowell began a profound question: “How does an ignorant world perform intricate functions requiring enormous knowledge?” Basically, the book is an extension of F. A. Hayek’s insights regarding the free market as an arrangement by which the most valuable knowledge that individuals possess is applied to the billions of problems that society faces each day. Hayek’s 1945 article is one of the most important articles ever written  in economics or any other social science. Congress ignores it at our peril.

Hayek spoke of the free market as a discovery process, and so it is. Sowell wrote about the production of a specific form of knowledge: knowledge that guides people’s decisions. It is not free.

The book is a detailed discussion of the implications of knowledge as a scarce resource. Sowell returns again and again to this theme: when civil government passes laws that assume that knowledge is either a free resource or ought to be, the result is inefficiency and a loss of liberty. He demonstrates his position with insightful analyses of how resources are misallocated because politicians treat knowledge as a free good. The section of the forcible restriction on competition (pp. 195-202) hones in on regulatory agencies.

He skipped the Securities and Exchange Commission  a pity, but not a great loss. It is not a great loss, because the SEC is covered magnificently by legal theorist, self-taught economist, and educational entrepreneur, Henry Manne [MANee]. He has launched several law and economics departments. But he made his academic reputation with his book, Insider Trading and the Stock Market (1966).

In that book, Manne showed that share pricing is affected only briefly by insider trading. Most information about a firm comes in a steady and seemingly random stream of news. As to how random this stream really is has become a matter of academic debate. If it is really random, how did Buffett get to be a multibillionaire? But for most investors most of the time, share price changes are random. So, any profit resulting from insider information is brief, and the same is true of losses.

As far as the general public is affected, insider trading is irrelevant. As far as the gains or losses to shareholders, only those few investors who buy or sell their shares on the day of the big move are winners or losers.

Manne hammered on this theme: share price movements precede the release of new information to the media. Inside information always gets out. In short, “buy on the rumor. Sell on the news.” This is true because inside information cannot be contained at a price that any free society should dare to impose.

Laws against insider trading create a black market for the distribution of this valuable information. The economic losses from the legislated restriction of insider trading were not considered in the decisions of Congress or the lawyers who wrote the administrative rules of the SEC.

The book is a masterpiece. It is long out of print. Manne told me that he once was told by one of the publishing company’s executives that the man planned to torpedo the book’s sales, so outraged was he over its defense of the free market.

CONCLUSION

I would like to think of the story of the schnook who forfeited his shot as the gold ring as one of those amusing stories that occasionally brighten our day, for stories of rich men who fall flat on their faces do greatly amuse us. It is nice to know that rich people are as subject to bad judgment as the rest of us are.

The schnook now insists that he had no idea that Buffett would act on his recommendation.

Does he expect us to believe this? If so, he is dumb. Really, truly dumb.

What bothers me is the possible aftermath of a story like this. It plays to the crowd. It is based on a falsehood, namely, that something the man did hurt anyone except short-term traders of shares of the most legendary buy-and-hold company in history.

I can see why Buffett would be upset. This guy made him look bad. He trusted a schemer  twice. The schemer betrayed his trust.

Why anyone else should care is beyond me.

Colt, a cornerstone name in both firearms and American history, is considering leaving their home state of Connecticut after almost two centuries of record thanks to the push by Governor Dannel Malloy to ban the AR-15.

For 177 years Colt has manufactured guns for the armies of the U.S. and its people, from the Single Action Army to the LE6920, the consumer version of the M4 carbine, the main service rifle of most of the military.

Following the Sandy Hook Elementary killing spree in Newtown, Connecticut, Malloy is singling out “assault weapons” and is fighting to get them banned as part of a much larger anti-gun package.

“I think there’s more than enough Democratic support. My hope is that we could do this on a bipartisan basis, but if we can’t do it on bipartisan basis, that we should get [a gun ban] done,” said Malloy.

He continued, “I’m anxious to see the legislature do it. But doing it right is more important than doing it quickly, so if I have to wait until the first week of June to get a good package, then that’s okay, too.”

That being said, Malloy does not want to lose the gun industry, either.

“The governor has been clear for some time that while he does not want manufacturers to leave the state, we need to move ahead with common sense gun violence prevention legislation that will improve public safety,” said Malloy spokesman Andrew Doba to Josh Miller of Fox News.

Malloy wants the tax revenue and employees  670 working directly for Colt  just not the guns.

But if such legislation passes and Colt stays in-state, the company’s reputation will take a potentially fatal blow. Colt CEO Dennis Veilleux is well-aware of the long memories of gun owners.

In 2000, after striking an agreement with the Clinton administration, a nation-wide Smith & Wesson boycott crippled the company, which later sold for pennies on the dollar after Smith was forced to close several manufacturing facilities following a massive drop in sales.

“Our customers are unusually brand-loyal,” said Veilleux in an op-ed published in the Hartford Courant. “In many cases, they personally identify with the firearm brand they choose. Although our Connecticut heritage has historically enhanced our brand, that will change overnight if we ban the modern sporting rifle.

734181,"We frequently hear people say they have nothing to hide—-so surrendering privacy and constitutional rights to the Surveillance State may not be such a big deal if it helps catch a terrorist or two. But with each passing day in the RussiaGate drama we are learning that this superficial exoneration is dangerously beside the point.

We are referring here to the unrelenting witch hunt that has been unleashed by Imperial Washington against the legitimately elected President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. This campaign of lies, leaks and Russophobia is the handiwork of Obama’s top national security advisors, who blatantly misused Washington’s surveillance apparatus to discredit Trump and to effectively nullify America’s democratic process.

That is, constitutional protections and liberties were systematically breached, but not simply to intimidate, hush or lock up citizens one by one as per the standard totalitarian modus operandi. Instead, what has happened is that the entire public debate has been hijacked by the shadowy forces of the Deep State and their partisan and media collaborators.

Time to buy old US gold coins

The enabling culprits are Obama’s last CIA director, John Brennan, his national security advisor Susan Rice and UN Ambassador Samantha Power. There is now mounting evidence that it was they who illegally “unmasked” NSA intercepts from Trump Tower; they who confected the Russian meddling narrative from behind the protective moat of classified intelligence; and they who orchestrated a systematic campaign of leaks and phony intelligence reports during the presidential transition—-all designed to delegitimize Trump before he even took the oath of office. Trumped! A Nation on t... David A. Stockman Best Price: $$12.99 Buy New $$44.99 (as of 06:10 EST - Details)

So all three of them should be locked­up—-that’s for sure. But the more urgent solution would be to unlock and make public all the innuendo, surmises, assessments, half-truths and boilerplate intelligence chatter on which the entire false narrative about Russian meddling and collusion is based.

Stated differently, without the nation’s massive intelligence apparatus and absurd system of secrecy and classified information to hide behind, the RussiaGate witch hunt would have never gotten off the ground.

In truth, as we will essay below, there is no there, there. So what this new chapter in McCarthyite hysteria actually demonstrates is that the Imperial City’s far-flung, 17-agency, $$75 billion Intelligence Behemoth is a plenary threat not just to individual liberty, but to the very constitutional democracy on which the latter depends.

To appreciate the severity of the threat, it is necessary to recognize that the post-9/11 Deep State has lowered a double whammy on our system. That is, it unconstitutionally collects the entirety of all internet based communications of America’s 325 million citizen, while at the same time it has effectively disenfranchised 98% of the 535 members of the House and Senate who have been elected to represent them.

Accordingly, behind the Surveillance State’s vast wall of secrecy and so-called “classified” information, there operates a Dark Government that is unaccountable to the public and largely unconstrained by normal constitutional limits, which the Patriot Act and secret FISA courts have more or less suspended.

In the realm of this Dark Government, the heart of American democracy—-the US Congress—has been completely usurped. Almost everything behind the secrecy wall is off limits to the rank and file. Only a handful of intelligence committee members and the House and Senate leadership gets sworn into the classified intelligence.

Yet just consider the hideous asymmetry of this arrangement. The so-called “Gang of Eight,” comprising the heads of the intelligence oversight committees and their respective party leadership, gets orally briefed in a secure “vault”, where they can’t take notes or carry-out any documents.

Moreover, this select handful of legislators consists of the incessantly mobilized and frazzled potentates of Capitol Hill who are always knee-deep in a thousand other distractions—-including a heavy quotient of politicking, fund-raising, and campaign trail excursions.

On the inside of the Surveillance State wall, by contrast, there are 600,000 employees or contractors with “top secret” security clearances alone; and more than 4 million total operatives who spend night and days feasting on the $$75 billion Intelligence Community (IC) budget and carrying out projects and missions designed to justify their existence and keep the budgetary gravy train flowing.

For example, in the National Security Agency (NSA) there is a subsidiary entity called TAO (Targeted Access Operations) with a budget of several billions and more than 1,000 employees. The latter predominately consist of high-powered civilian and military hackers, computer geeks, intelligence analysts, targeting specialists, computer hardware and software designers and electrical engineers—-whose job it is to do exactly what Russia is being accused of.

Namely, to hack and electronically infiltrate the communications and operations of nearly every government on the planet, and most especially those of IC designated enemies and adversaries such as Russia and Iran.Indeed, TAOs motto says it all: The Great Deformation:... David A. Stockman Best Price: $$4.32 Buy New $$15.58 (as of 05:35 EST - Details)

“Your data is our data, your equipment is our equipment ­ anytime, any place, by any legal means.”

In any given 24-hour day, the TAO hacks and deposits more disinformation and malware into its targeted foreign networks than all the low level Russian probes that were intercepted by NSA during the entire Presidential campaign.

In other words, Washington is the mother of all hackers and cyber-warfare operations, and what Russia and other nations do is only a small potatoes version of the same. Yet the overwhelming share of these digital cloak and dagger operation by all sides is a huge waste of national resources; and most especially it is of no value at all to the safety of the American people.

That because Russia, China and Iran—-the principal targets of the IC’s massive surveillance and cyber warfare activities—are no threats whatsoever to America’s security.

Iran has zero military capacity to attack the American homeland, and the claim that it is the leading sponsor of terrorism is pure bunkum. That hoary claim has been concocted by the Washington neocons and the Netanyahu political machine—both of which need demonized enemies in order to nurture the public fears on which their power is based.

Likewise, Russia has one 40-year old smoke-belching aircraft carry and a fleet of rowboats—–neither of which are capable of launching an assault on the New Jersey shores. True, it does have about 1,00o nuclear warheads; but where is the evidence that cool-hand Vlad is contemplating national suicide by using them against the US or Europe?

The purported Chinese threat is even more ludicrous. Notwithstanding the fertile imaginations of the Deep State fear-mongers who believe the South China Sea is actually an American Lake, the Red Suzerains of Beijing know fully well that without the continuous custom of Wal-Mart and Amazon warehouses, the Red Ponzi would collapse in a heartbeat. And that they would be hung by angry mobs from the CCTV (China Central Television) Tower shortly thereafter.

In fact, we don’t need the $$75 billion Surveillance State to deal with the Taliban, the jihadist warlords of Somalia or any of the warring Sunni vs. Shiite (Houthis) parties of Yemen, either. They do not threaten America’s security in the slightest.

Nor did the government of Khadafy in Libya after he turned in his nukes. Likewise, the Assad regime has never, ever threatened to harm America—-despite the non-stop vilification from Washington.

At most, Washington needs modest local and theatre level capacity to monitor the fading remnants of the Islamic State—-a temporary scourge in the mostly the impoverished Sunni villages of the Upper Euphrates, which would not even exist in the first place had it not been fostered and armed with the weapons the US Army left behind in the fiasco of Iraq.

So consider the contrafactual. In the absence of a vast Warfare State apparatus and associated Surveillance State wall of secrecy what would RussiaGate amount to?

The answer is straight-forward: It was nothing more than a politically motivated plot orchestrated by former CIA director Brennan to undermine the Presidential campaign of a rambunctious outsider. That is, the Donald was unschooled in the groupthink of the Imperial City and had enough common sense to realize that Putin is not our enemy, that NATO is obsolete, that regime change has been a fiasco and that foreign policy should be based on homeland security first, not the perpetuation of an American Empire abroad. The Triumph of Politic... David Stockman Best Price: $$3.40 Buy New $$56.63 (as of 06:00 EST - Details)

Those inchoate impulses were the Donald’s original sin, and it was unverified and self-serving “intelligence” from the Latvian security service—-of all things—- that provided the pretext for Brennan to launch the Deep State’s own version of jihad against Trump.

What this dubious intelligence did was to finger Vlad Putin himself and that was crucial. It permitted Brennan to puff-up the evidence of run-of-the-mill cyber intrusions by the Russian security services—-or even unconnected Russian hackers and profiteers— into a sweeping but phony narrative about an attack on American democracy with Putin at the very center.

As Scott Ritter—- the weapons expert who blew the whistle on the IC’s trumped up claims about Saddam’s WMDs—-succinctly explained in a recent article, Brennan proceeded to turn a dubious molehill into a vertiable mountain:

According to reporting from the Washington Post, sometime during this period, CIA Director John Brennan gained access to a sensitive intelligence report from a foreign intelligence service. This service claimed to have technically penetrated the inner circle of Russian leadership to the extent that it could give voice to the words of Russian President Vladimir Putin as he articulated Russia’s objectives regarding the 2016 U.S. Presidential election — to defeat Hillary Clinton and help elect Donald Trump, her Republican opponent. This intelligence was briefed to President Barack Obama and a handful of his closest advisors in early August, with strict instructions that it not be further disseminated.

The explosive nature of this intelligence report, both in terms of its sourcing and content, served to drive the investigation of Russian meddling in the American electoral process by the U.S. intelligence community. The problem, however, was that it wasn’t the U.S. intelligence community, per se, undertaking this investigation, but rather (according to the Washington Post) a task force composed of “several dozen analysts from the CIA, NSA and FBI,” hand­picked by the CIA director and set up at the CIA Headquarters who “functioned as a sealed compartment, its work hidden from the rest of the intelligence community.”

The result was a closed­circle of analysts who operated in complete isolation from the rest of the U.S. intelligence community. The premise of their work — that Vladimir Putin personally directed Russian meddling in the U.S. Presidential election to tip the balance in favor of Donald Trump — was never questioned in any meaningful fashion, despite its sourcing to a single intelligence report from a foreign service.

President Obama ordered the U.S. intelligence community to undertake a comprehensive review of Russian electoral meddling. As a result, intelligence analysts began to reexamine old intelligence reports based upon the premise of Putin’s direct involvement, allowing a deeply disturbing picture to be created of a comprehensive Russian campaign to undermine the American electoral process.

Here’s the thing. Vlad didn’t do it. The only interference in the electoral process that he has been associated with is with respect to what Imperial Washington did next door while he was basking in glory at the Sochi Olympics in February 2014.

To wit, the violent coup on the streets of Kiev was organized by agents and organs of the US government; overthrew a constitutionally elected President who had decided to make an economic and security deal with Russia rather than Europe and NATO in keeping with Ukraine’s economic propinquity to the former and its 700- years of history as an integral part of Greater Russia; and which imposed a new government, hand-picked by the Obama State Department, which was dominated by Ukrainian nationalists and neo-Nazis who were demonstrably hostile to the Russian speaking populations of Crimea and the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.

Stated differently, Imperial Washington is the world champion meddler in other peoples’ politics and elections. Since the CIA sponsored coup against the Mosaddegh government in Iran in 1953, it has sponsored more than eighty incidents ranging from election bag money to military coups.

By contrast, the putative Russian attack on American democracy consists of three specific accusations—all of which are readily refutable.

In the first place, Podesta’s password was “password” and could have been hacked by any fat guy, or not, on any computer plugged into the worldwide web anywhere.

Moreover, Julian Assange of Wikileaks, who makes a living disclosing the truth, not propagating lies as does the IC, says it did not come from Russian state agents; and that it was in fact leaked, not hacked, by disgruntled Democrat insiders.

In any event, if it had actually been hacked by either Russian agents or the proverbial fat guy, there would be a digital imprint stored in NSA’s vast server farms. The fact that it hasn’t leaked amidst all the rest of the anti-Russian innuendo and intelligence hearsay proves beyond much doubt that no such record exists and no such Russian intrusion ever happened.

As for the DNC emails, the smoking gun there still smolders in plain sight. The FBI apparently never even took custody of the DNC computer—–farming out the job to an outfit named Crowdstrike. Alas, the latter is a DNC contractor and wannabe silicon valley IPO run by some fanatical Russian ex-pats looking for fame and fortune. It’s no wonder they didn’t want the FBI second guessing their conclusions.

Finally, there is the Latvian “intelligence” morsel about Putin’s personal direction of the election meddling campaign. If the Donald had any common sense he would declassify said report forthwith.

But never mind. It surely doesn’t exist anyway—-or it too would have leaked long ago.

And that’s all she wrote. The rest is pure spin leaked by Trump’s enemies in the Deep State and canonized by its collaborators in the main stream media.

Unfortunately, the Donald doesn’t seem to recognize that he is actually President. If he did, he would have the Justice Department launch a prosecution against the faithless officials—-Brennan, Rice and Power—-who concocted the whole RussiaGate defamation in the first place.

219127,"Lew Rockwell has created a Homeschooling Archive with a collection of informative articles on this fast-growing trend. If you are a parent with a pre-schooler and are torn between public school and homeschooling, the articles in this new archive could help you decide. Also, this article on problems in public schools in Beaufort, South Carolina might be beneficial.

Although Beaufort is a relatively small town, it is not immune to the PC craziness sweeping the nation. This is especially true of Beaufort County public schools. What I’m going to relate is true but it might be difficult to believe. However, if you consider the radical changes occurring in public schools during in the last few decades, it will not only seem believable but inevitable. The phenomenon generally described as Political Correctness has infected public schools where young students, in their formative years, provide captive minds for instructors to test their latest social experiments.

In the 1980s a new educational philosophy was developed: ""Outcome-based education."" Briefly, OBE calls for centralized control of educational standards as opposed to local control. A central authority establishes outcomes for not only ""academic"" standards but, equally important, ""affective"" (emotional) standards. Although academic standards alone served us well from the beginning of civilized society until the 1980s, they do not satisfy the cultural elites. Reading, writing and arithmetic must now share the stage with behavior modification. Schools are conditioning students to comport themselves in the manner that best accommodates a multicultural society.

The OBE commissars justify the need for ""affective"" learning with the argument that ""children need to be carefully socialized in multiracial and ethnically diverse institutions in order to provide a basis for an orderly, yet tolerant society."" However, OBE’s ""tolerant society"" claim is called into question by comments made at an OBE training seminar where the instructor characterized fundamentalist Baptists as ""ignorant, dangerous religious extremists, prone to abuse children."" Once again, as we have seen with other PC initiatives, OBE’s tolerance only goes one way. Their way.

Although many schools, including those in Beaufort, have not implemented outcome-based education, their educational philosophy is, none-the-less, quite similar. Social modification is as important as scholastic instruction. Egalitarianism and, of course, ""sensitivity,"" drive this new social conditioning, and various untested techniques are now being tried out.

Some Beaufort schools experimented with cooperative learning groups. Classes were divided into small groups of roughly five students each. For each group, the teacher tried to create a mix of diverse students as regards skills, gender and ethnicity. The group was graded as a whole rather than individually. Some children complained to their parents that they could not move on to new material until everyone in the group was ready. They had to wait for slower learners to catch up.

Another PC experiment literally enraged parents of young boys. Their sons were required to come to school dressed as girls in order to help the boys empathize with the ""inequities"" girls face. Some of these parents stood firm against the school’s directive and refused to comply.

This final example of what is happening in Beaufort schools is one that I consider the most appalling. This episode concerns a clever and spunky little girl, Tracey Merrill (not her real name) who will soon have her seventh birthday. Tracey is a Brownie in the Girl Scouts and exceptionally bright for her age, so much so that she skipped a grade when she first entered school.

Like any young child, Tracey eagerly anticipated her birthday and her parents were almost as excited as she. A special birthday party was planned based on a theme chosen by Tracey: Hawaii. Tracy wanted her birthday party patterned after an Hawaiian Luau. At first, she toyed with the idea of inviting both boys and girls. But, after explaining to her mother that ""Girls act differently around boys,"" Tracey decided that her party would be strictly a ""girl thing."" The list of invitees was trimmed to eleven of her girlfriends at school.

The little girl and her mother designed special RSVP invitations featuring an Hawaiian motif. Grass hula skirts were obtained for the girls and an excited Tracey set about making leis using artificial flower petals strung together with dental floss. Her Dad agreed to videotape the birthday party.

As the special day drew nearer, Tracey’s teacher accidentally overheard two girls discussing a party. After interrogating them and learning about the birthday party, the teacher immediately placed a call to Tracey’s mother. The teacher explained that it is against school rules to invite only selected members of a class to social events because those excluded may feel slighted and have hurt feelings. Even worse, those not invited may feel that there are even more sinister reasons for their being excluded. The school required that if a parent plans a social event for their child, the entire class must be invited.

The frustrated parents, not wanting to cause problems for their daughter at school, reluctantly agreed to send additional invitations to the rest of the class. The number of possible attendees increased to 25. Particulars of the birthday party also had to be altered. Hula skirts and leis were discarded. And, with increased expense to the parents, the party was changed to a cookout for 25 with as much of an Hawaiian flavor as possible.

Tracey was confused over the compulsory changes to her birthday party plans. She also felt a little guilty as though she had done something wrong. But, of course, she had not. Simply stated, the public school Bolsheviks placed collective interests above individual interests, in this case the birthday wishes of a little girl.

This incident is another minor milestone in our journey to what might be called a Grave New World. By all indications, this new world will be characterized by excessive government controls and regulations; few personal choices, and an absence of spontaneity.

It’s almost two years since the invasion of Iraq and the world has not been able to hear from any of the members of Saddam Hussein’s regime, because of course they are all under lock and key, waiting to go on trial for hiding weapons of mass destruction they did not have and for colluding with Al Qaeda, which they did not do. I’ve often wondered what happened to Muhammad al-Douri (as I have spelled his surname). I had been in daily touch with him by e-mail and cellphone when he was Iraq’s Ambassador to the United Nations in the last days before the March 2003 invasion, but lost touch with him when he left quickly for Europe on the day Baghdad fell.

We’d originally met through his predecessor at the UN, Nizar Hamdoon, who I’d known since I began looking into the allegations of Iraq’s misdeeds in 1997. Hamdoon passed away last year, of cancer, and I’d been assured by the Iraqi U.N. Mission that al-Douri was okay. It was nice, though, to see this interview on the Al Jazeera English website this week. I would have missed it in my daily scan, but spotted his frowning visage. He’s really a most pleasant fellow, a rather distinguished lawyer who joined the diplomatic corps to represent Iraq at the Human Rights Convention in Geneva. In case you wonder, I agree completely with him in this interview, that the recent elections are meaningless because they were arranged along sectarian, not nationalist lines. President Bush should read this. He would learn a thing or two.

Z is for zinc which is an essential trace mineral. Zinc is the twenty fifth most abundant element in the earths crust. It is water soluble and tends to be leached easily from our soils and from our food. Zinc deficiencies are fairly common since much zinc is refined and processed out of grains and other foods.

Zinc is needed to make more than 100 different enzymes that control essential processes throughout the body. Zinc is also involved in more bodily functions than any other mineral. Zinc is important for normal growth and development, body tissue maintenance, sexual function, immune response, and detoxification of chemicals and metabolic irritants.

Zinc speeds up wound healing. It is commonly used before and after surgery to speed recovery time and reduce postoperative complications such as wound infections. Zinc is also useful in treating skin problems such as boils, bedsores, dermatitis and acne.

Zinc has also been shown to support immune function. Zinc increases T lymphocyte production and enhances other white blood cell functions. Studies have verified that zinc is helpful in reducing the incidence and severity of colds and flues. Zinc lozenges can provide dramatic relief in some cases of sore throat.

Zinc deficiency is sometimes related to BPH, or benign prostate hypertrophy via its relationship with cadmium. Cadmium competes with zinc for absorption and it is actually cadmium toxicity that is linked to BPH. Zinc supplementation helps balance the cadmium-zinc ratio and helps prevent BPH.

Many health disorders are associated with zinc deficiency. These include acne, cataracts, epilepsy, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, depression, diabetes, chronic infections, infertility, learning disabilities and environmental sensitivity. Loss of taste, brittleness of nails and white spots on nails are all symptoms of zinc deficiency.

Zinc is found in most animal foods such as meat, eggs and milk. Oysters are particularly high in zinc. It is also abundant in whole grains and nuts. Pumpkin seeds are high in zinc as is ginger.

The zinc that is contained in whole grains is in the germ and bran which are refined out in making white flour. Zinc is also lost in canning and cooking as it is water soluble. Water was once a good source of zinc when galvanized water pipes were used. Now copper pipes are used which not only removes a source of zinc, but adds copper which competes with zinc and sometimes displaces it.

The RDA for zinc in adults is 15 mg., yet the average diet contains only about 10 mg. of zinc. For general maintenance, the average need is around 15-30 mg. per day, with 30-60 mg. needed to correct deficiencies. For long term use, it is better to take zinc in combination with other minerals so that other imbalances do not occur.

Mr. Warren Buffett has retired. He has given away or plans to give away most of his multi-billion dollar fortune. Mr. Buffett, meet Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard. Why not make a healthy contribution to the Ludwig von Mises Institute?

""It is the mission of the Mises Institute to restore a high place for theory in economics and the social sciences, encourage a revival of critical historical research, and draw attention to neglected traditions in Western philosophy. In this cause, the Mises Institute works to advance the Austrian School of economics and the Misesian tradition, and, in application, defends the market economy, private property, sound money, and peaceful international relations, while opposing government intervention as economically and socially destructive.""

Remarked upon by both von Mises and Rothbard is the quite unbelievable but not at all unusual fact that some of the most important capitalists deny the efficacy and justice of free markets. Mr. Buffett is among them. I have singled him out only because it is part of his genius to simplify matters and speak of them clearly. We are not in doubt as to his views. The lessons we have to learn by analyzing views such as his go well beyond what he as an individual thinks and believes.

We have much to learn from Warren Buffett as investment genius and as business manager. But he and others have much to learn from Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard and those following in their footsteps who are advancing the Austrian School of economics.

In accumulating his wealth, Mr. Buffett has followed the saying ""Shoemaker, stick to thy last."" He has stuck to investing in and managing businesses he knows about, while avoiding all others. He has resolutely stuck to his investment rules. He has patiently waited until the market has pitched balls that he can hit out of the park. He personifies focus, the opposite of conglomeration.

When he ventures out of his area of expertise, he often falls flat on his face. He needs to meet Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard. He needs exposure to the Misesian tradition. He does not understand that government intervention is economically and socially destructive.

The Ludwig von Mises Institute should offer Mr. Buffett a place at Mises University. The intellectual sparks would fly! Mr. Buffett’s views on related matters of economic, social, and political policies have already come in for analysis and criticism in the LRC pages. Mr. Buffett favors the estate tax. Lew Rockwell explains to Mr. Buffett and all of us that repealing the estate tax will generate more wealth and more charitable giving. Repeal makes it easier for new people, supported by inherited family wealth, to compete with the rich and super-rich.

Mr. Buffett is guilty over his wealth. He thinks he doesn’t merit it and hasn’t earned it. He thinks his talents came by birth and that he doesn’t deserve them. He’s an egalitarian who has publicly endorsed the Rawlsian veil of ignorance. St. Paul has written: ""Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonor?"" Mr. Buffett is said to be agnostic. He does not endorse such ideas. But even if Mr. Buffett were a Christian, does he know what he was born with and what he developed? Can he or any of us distinguish? Isn’t each one of us enfolded in a complex process of choice and external human and providential influences that is beyond our comprehension? And leaving aside all such considerations that raise doubt about the propriety of guilt and egalitarian ideas, there are no moral or practical grounds for Mr. Buffett to endorse government as the remedy. Government is an agency of violence; and government agents can’t possibly know enough to reallocate human merits and demerits. And besides being disruptive and creating strife, political processes are anything but fair.

Greg Bacon brings us the information that Mr. Buffett favors the progressive income tax, on the ground that the market system produces inequitable results. Mr. Buffett’s businesses have brought major benefits to consumers. He has invested large sums of money at times (like 1974) when others were fearful and assessed high risks. Although both kinds of activities have brought him large returns, maybe the uncertainties and risks were really high. He bought at low prices when conditions were bad and looked like they would stay bad. Mr. Buffett didn’t think so. He doesn’t think he was taking a chance. He held a long view. It encompassed eventual recovery. But he could have been wrong. He won a bet. He won a series of bets, but he does not look at it that way. He thinks he got a free lunch, that Mr. Market inequitably gave him a free lunch.

I don’t doubt that Mr. Buffett’s unique talents and mind have earned him some rent, but does that mean that everyone who does well in a market is earning rents? Mr. Buffett does not understand that the progressive income tax discourages entrepreneurial actions and risk-taking such as his. It acts as if market rewards are unearned rents that are unfair, as if they were compensation for nothing. And does the government of all things know what is rent and what is not? Does it know enough to manipulate tax rates for whole classes of people in such a way as not to undermine the economic incentives to produce wealth? Mr. Buffett navely thinks that the State is some kind of beneficent and all-knowing institution. He does not seem to grasp that politicians and interest groups are out for power and the dollar and willingly destroy wealth to get them.

Mr. Buffett’s company (Berkshire) writes catastrophe insurance. It often writes policies that other companies won’t touch. As long as no catastrophes occur, the company keeps the premiums and makes lots of money. When a catastrophe strikes, the company loses a great deal of money. In November of 2001, Mr. Buffett wrote a very revealing article on ""An FDIC for Insurers."" He revealed that his profits are not always a free lunch: ""I did something very dumb: allowed Berkshire to provide insurance coverage for a huge catastrophe loss without its getting a premium for doing so. The risk we unthinkingly assumed was a loss from terrorism."" Berkshire’s loss from Sept.11 was $$2.3 billion, he estimated. He pointed out that a nuclear device would have been much worse. ""Given that kind of horrendous, but not impossible, nuclear scenario, insured losses could have been $$1 trillion, an amount that exceeds the net worth of all property-casualty insurers worldwide.""

Insurers can get off the hook by inserting clauses that exempt them from paying off for losses due to nuclear events, much in the same way that homeowners’ policies do not cover earthquake damages. Nuclear catastrophe may simply be too uncertain, too widespread, and too damaging an event to be suitable for a company insurance policy.

Buffett went on to say that to insure such a loss required an entity greater than existed in the private sector: ""Only the U.S. government fits the bill."" Congress did pass the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, extended and amended in 2005. While called insurance, it is not. The insurance companies now have unwilling partners, namely, the taxpayers. The insurance industry writes the policies insuring against terrorism losses. These losses are capped at a relatively low level. If the losses exceed that level, then taxpayers pay. Under this scheme, insurers can write policies profitable to them knowing that all losses beyond a certain amount will be shifted to taxpayers.

In true insurance, the pool of voluntary rate-payers shares a risk. Those who happen to be unfortunate are compensated by the premiums willingly paid into a pool by those who are fortunate enough not to have been hit. The government scheme has no such pool. Instead, the losers rob American taxpayers in general. If such losses could be $$1 trillion, as Buffett suggests, the amount paid by each household would be $$10,000! From this standpoint, attempting to insure against a nuclear terrorism event is absolutely pointless and counter-productive. If a large part of Los Angeles were destroyed, it is senseless to make every household in America pay a huge sum to compensate the survivors (if households could even pay such sums.) This would depress economic activity throughout the country and would not allocate resources to their most urgent rebuilding, survivor, and productive needs. It would be better to follow the normal course of allowing markets to transfer resources to where they are needed.

The argument that Buffett made for the government intervention was that cities are public goods and that their benefits are spread over the entire country so that their costs also should be similarly spread: ""For example, the terrorism risk per dollar of insured value may be 10 or more times for iconic or critical properties in New York City what it is for properties in less-populated areas. But great cities are central to our society. We don’t want them to wither under the burden of hugely disadvantageous insurance costs. Indeed, it’s in America’s interest for them to thrive. Citizens of our leading cities almost certainly bear above-normal physical risks in the war being waged upon us by terrorists. We should not impose crippling economic costs on them as well.""

This argument was fully accepted by legislators. For example, one news report wrote: ""The legislation helps assure that economic activity in U.S. cities can go on uninterrupted, said Rep. Barney Frank, Massachusetts Democrat. u2018The alternative is to let the terrorists put a terrorist tax on building large buildings in our large cities and we should not allow that.’""

Buffett went on to paint a dire picture: ""At the moment, leaving aside insurance policies soon due to run out, millions of business owners, individuals, landlords and lenders bear the economic risk of terrorist attacks. Insurers won’t step up to assume the risk — we were previously dumb, but we’ve learned. It isn’t right, though, that these risk-laden millions should have to shoulder this burden themselves: That would be self-insurance, and the economic distortions it would cause would stagger our society. Who would ever build a skyscraper in a major city or lend against it?""

Mr. Buffett and Mr. Frank both badly need to attend Mises University in order to jumpstart their economic education. Neither one understands that their views are completely faulty. In lieu of their finding their way to Auburn, Alabama, a few comments are in order concerning their benighted thinking.

In the absence of any insurance against terrorism or a nuclear catastrophe, life can and will go on in cities exposed to these events. Let us think about an analogous case. If it were discovered that Omaha (where Berkshire is housed) sits atop a fault and is subject to uninsurable earthquake risk, what would happen? There would be a loss of value. Wealth would diminish. No amount of insurance can diminish such a loss. Insurance can only transfer wealth from those in an insurance pool who have been lucky. No amount of government forced wealth transfer can prevent the loss of value. It occurs the moment that the earthquake risk is discovered.

Meanwhile, Omaha would go on. It pays to continue using the capital stock insofar as possible and/or adapt it. The value of property in parts of Omaha exposed to possible damage would decline. The extent of the decline would depend on how individuals perceive factors such as location, chances of an earthquake, timing of a possible earthquake, and estimates of damages. If the event were thought to be 10—20 years into the future, the value impacts would be greatly diminished because of present-value mathematics; a large portion of the value of many assets hinges on their net cash flows in the immediate and near future. Events in the distant future have much lower present worth.

The more risk-averse portions of the population might leave the city. Less risk-averse persons might move in. People who place a high value on living in Omaha might stay. Others might leave. The city would go on.

Some people would take measures to mitigate the possible damages to existing structures. This depends on their cost/benefit calculations. People who built new structures would make them more earthquake-proof.

The more that people regard a nuclear or an earthquake event as imminent and serious, the more drastic will be the adjustments they make. They might indeed not decide to build a new skyscraper. They might instead decide to build elsewhere. This would obviously be a good thing! It makes no sense to build in dangerous regions. Diversification of location is a good idea if some areas are safer than others. Dispersal of resources is a sound idea under such circumstances. Under the Buffett/Frank scheme, first we encourage and subsidize people to stay in dangerous areas while taxing those who don’t. Second, society concentrates its resources in those dangerous areas. Third, Buffett and Frank assume that the status quo ante is the best situation. But clearly the terrorism and/or nuclear risk has changed that. The best situation, which only individuals can discover for themselves anyway, may now entail spreading homes and businesses over broader and more defensible regions. Fourth, what right does the government have anyway to interfere in such matters as where we live? And what right does it have to steal from some in order to indemnify others? Many people choose not to live in vulnerable and unsafe cities. They prefer safer towns. Why penalize them? Why compensate and subsidize those who choose to live in cities?

It is truly amazing that such an intelligent figure as Buffett can make so many stupid arguments. But he himself knows this! He himself has written about this! He has observed that very smart people often invest badly because they fall prey to greed, envy, fear, boredom, extraneous factors, and emotions. He says that, in a word, they do not act rationally, or that their ego gets in their way. They need to insulate themselves from all of this to invest well. When it comes to politics, Buffett and others — he is far from being alone — allow extraneous and emotional factors to disrupt their thought.

Buffett argues that cities are central and we don’t want them to wither under high insurance costs. In saying this, he fails to understand that the costs are sunk. The cities are where they are and as they are for many reasons, including government laws. If they have suffered losses due to terrorism or nuclear risks, and we really do not know much about these, they were brought on by the actions of our own State. If we inoculate the cities against nuclear risks, if it were even possible, that simply affirms the State’s existing foreign policies. Why not change the foreign policies that have enhanced and continue to enhance the probability of more attacks on U.S. soil?

Buffett argues that we all get benefits (or positive externalities) from our cities. That is what he means by ""It’s in America’s interest for them to thrive."" He can’t identify America’s interest. Americans identify their own interests. Mr. Buffett is not sovereign over the interests of 300 million Americans, and neither are 535 members of Congress although they act as if they are. Even if Americans want thriving cities, it does not logically follow that the proper way to get them is through a government-coerced scheme.

Americans should thrive where and how they wish to thrive. If they choose cities or abandon them, that is their business. And if, in the process of choosing cities or not, they produce external benefits or costs, it is up to them to adjust accordingly.

Americans have already adjusted to the external benefits and costs of cities. They have already taken them into account prior to 9/11 in an infinite number of choices. Mr. Buffett simply wants to preserve the status quo, and for that emotional attachment there is no rationale.

Mr. Buffett thinks it is not right that people living in risk-prone areas should shoulder those risks. He thinks that the market system produces gains for people like him, and he thinks they are not proper gains. He is consistent in his thought. He also thinks that people living in the cities now have been hit with losses they should not have to bear. But if ex ante individual freedom of choice, including freedom to locate, is not right, why is it not right? What reason does any one of us have to distrust what millions of others choose to do as they make their economic choices? We have no good reason if we see them as sovereign human beings who are running their own lives. What justification do we have for interfering with some so as to benefit others? We have no good reason unless we wish to play God or unless we distrust individuals. If individual freedom is not right, then what is? Is ex post egalitarianism right? Who is to be the omniscient earthly God that dispenses the social justice that Mr. Buffett yearns for? He has nominated the State. He has chosen elitism over freedom.

Mr. Buffett says of us ""We should not impose crippling economic costs on them [city-dwellers] as well."" No, we should not; and we have not. Such costs as there are have arisen from terrorists who have beefs with the actions of the U.S. in distant and foreign lands. But why does Mr. Buffett make this statement? In what context? Mr. Buffett wants to shelter his insurance operations and those of other companies from some very large risks. He expresses this desire while making statements about public benefit. This is a matter of public record. It would be easy to infer cupidity, but I see no need for that. I charge him with economic, social, and political ignorance and naïveté. He thinks that if the government does not promise to pay for damages stemming from nuclear catastrophes, then we face staggering economic distortions. But what good is such a promise? If all we did was get such a promise and if a nuclear catastrophe then occurred in New York, it could cripple the entire financial structure of the world. If we did nothing but rest assured on a government promise that cannot be fulfilled if such an event occurred, we would make ourselves even more vulnerable to attack. Such promises underwrite counterproductive location decisions and subsidize not adapting to the threats. They create distortions.

The State operates a slew of phony ""insurance"" schemes. The promised payments (liabilities) of all of them combined are gargantuan. They cannot all be met or paid. Americans are living in a dream world based on paper promises. Someone as shrewd as Warren Buffett should understand this. His mis-education is symptomatic of a widespread problem. I do believe he would benefit from Mises University.

Left to its own devices, undistorted by government inducements, the private sector and private choices can reduce the prospective damages from terrorist and nuclear attacks. Companies will disperse and harden facilities. They will back up computer, information, and financial systems. They will purchase private protection forces. Individuals will locate to safer places. Free individuals in free markets will resolve or alleviate any and all risks in appropriate ways that even geniuses like Warren Buffett cannot conceive of.

372178,"Just when you thought genetically modified mosquitoes and mutated dinner entrees were the extent of biotech’s hunger to manipulate the genetic coding of the planet, scientists have now unleashed a plan to launch thousands of ‘frankenfly’ style insects into the wild in order to combat pests.

And just like we saw with the release of genetically modified mosquitoes, the altered insects are actually being pushed as a ‘green alternative’ to the use of chemicals. You see, British scientists claim that mutating the genetic code of the insects is actually a way of substituting for the use of chemical pesticides. Chemical pesticides used to lower the population of olive flies in Britain. The reality here, however, is that you are taking something damaging like chemical pesticides and replacing it with something far worse.

It’s like trading in your aging car for a bicycle, except in this case the bicycle also happens to include side effects like ‘may alter the genetic structure of the entire insect population’.

According to the Daily Mail, which dubs these insects as ‘frankenflies’ (and rightfully so), the frankenflies are meant to radically reduce the current generation of olive flies:

“The trial would involve releasing genetically modified male olive flies which would mate with the wild females with the result that all the female offspring would die at the larvae or maggot stage.”

I miss the days of smoke-filled rooms when crooked pols chose corrupt presidential candidates who were approximately sane. Today we have a sort of presidential bus-station lottery. We choose as ruler any beer-hall putz who can shake hands and grin his way successfully through New Hampshire. This, plus the deep rot of the American political framework, is allowing the rapid conversion of the United States into something previous Americans would hardly recognize.

“Ricky, Ricky he’s our man. If he can’t do it, nobody can. Goooooooooooo Plesiosaurs!”

Permit me a foray of a paragraph into psychojournalism. It fascinates me to know that George Bush was a male cheerleader at Andover. Yes, it could have been worse. He might have been a table-dancer. But most of us who were in high school when he was recognize that you either came to watch football, or you came to watch the girl cheerleaders. There was something odd about a boy who wanted to be one.

We are ruled by a male cheerleader who favors torture. I wonder what things twist in the inner fog.

Given a president who seems chiefly concerned to display his indomitable manhood, the question arises: What restraints keep him from absolute control of a formidably armed nation of three hundred million? The Constitution, noblest of fables, was designed to do just this. But absent the will to enforce them, checks and balances do not exist, and laws, principles, and constitutions mean nothing. If no one says no, the president simply behaves as he wants. The genius of the strange little man in the White House has been to recognize this, to divine the weakness of the American political order.

When he wanted to attack Iraq, he simply lied, and lied again, and shifted his ground and lied again. It worked. When he didn’t want to follow the Geneva Conventions in his treatment of captured Iraqis, he just declared his prisoners of war not to be prisoners of war. Torture? He just did it and faced down the country and the world. Disregard of civil rights? Spying? He just did as he chose.

Here is the great discovery of the little man who doesn’t read. America is not the land of the free, nor of the brave, nor of the politically sentient. Nor is it a country of laws or of principles. It is a country of those who just do as they want. A president can do anything he chooses. Who will tell him no? Nobody has.

Today there is speculation as to whether he will make war, perhaps nuclear war, on Iran. The universal assumption seems to be that if he wants to, he will just do it. The legislature, already having given up its authority to declare war, seems to regard the military as the private guard of the president. Is it not interesting that one dim, pugnacious, ignorant little man can bring on nuclear war all by himself?

When Mr. Bush gets caught lying or breaking the law, he shows no embarrassment, contrition, or sense of having done anything wrong. He seems to have no conception of right and wrong, of principle. He is not accustomed to being told no, and accepts no constraints on his power. All that matters to him is that he get his way. He gets it.

Where will this lead? Obviously, to vastly increased police powers. But I wonder. If, down the pike, Bush announced that to protect us from terrorism he would have to postpone the presidential elections and remain in officewhat would happen? Suppose he came up with a bit of supportive theater. If just before the elections something blew up, and were attributed not to the CIA but to Terrace, what then? The Reichstag has burned before. The public, the congress, the judiciary are so very, very easily manipulated. All it takes is the will to do it.

And that the little man has.

A tribal rite in the column racket is the discovery of darkness in the hearts of presidents, or witlessness, and we discover away industriously. I have done my share. I thought Clinton a bright, libidinous lout, Jimmy Carter a moralizing cipher, Reagan a sort of Grandfather Barbie and, by contrast, Eisenhower a wise man hiding behind remarkable syntax. None was evil, or mad. Bush is something new in presidential politics, genuinely dangerous and genuinely out of control. The time is ripe for him. America no longer has the institutional defenses to say ""no.""

What would happen if a president just refused to go? To remove him, someone would have to act. Who? Little would be necessary to stop a coup, granted. A couple of helicopters of Marines landing across the street from the White House would be enough. The various federal police bully civilians well (ask Steve Hatfill), but would find fighting real men another thing. But who in the military would have the courage to do it?

Would the public do anything? I doubt it. The Born Agains would support him, the suburban Christians suck their thumbs and wait, blacks ignore the matter, conservatives see it as necessary to stop Tersm, and most people would watch football on television. The necessary strength is not in the country. The timbers are rotten.

A popular uprising I cannot imagine. Who would rise? Overweight people with Volvos do not become urban guerrillas. Again, conservatives, who tend to be armed, rank among the most ardent supporters of Mr. Bush. In any event, how does one rise? Would upset semi-heterosexual professors at Cornell hold a Take Back the Night march? Oh joy. After three days the vigilists would become bored. Back to the television set.

The Supreme Court certainly would, and could, do nothing. The court consists of insular antiquities who so far have shown no disposition to stand up to Bush. The termites have hollowed the judicial woodpile.

Congress? It does what is paid to do, by anyone. What could it do? Some might say that it could shut off funding. With the threat of imprisonment at its collective head? It would huff, fumble, and hold committee hearings. But a coup would have to be squelched immediately or not at all.

My impression is that much of the public wants authoritarian rule, or would be perfectly content with it if it even noticed its arrival. No, I can’t prove it. But what do most people care about beyond television on screens that grow ever larger, beyond porn, beer, and the competitive purchase of grander SUVs? I ask this not as a lifelong curmudgeon being tiresome (though doubtless I am both) but seriously. Who in a sprawling TV-besotted country cares about the Constitution? A comfortable police state is after all comfortable.

I do not predict that the reigning curiosity will stage a coup (which should it occur would not be a coup but an emergency measure, necessary to protect us from Terrace). I do say that what is happening today is unlike anything that has happened before, and that people do not always see what is coming. If you read books from the Germany of the 1930s, you will find that people were uneasy, divided, unsure of things, but had no idea just what the squatty little man with the voice had in mind for them. He just did it. The unimaginable does sometime occur. We notice only afterward.

213860,"Recently by Walter E. Williams: Should the Rich Be Condemned?

Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, in his New York Times column titled “Free to Die” (9/15/2011), pointed out that back in 1980, his late fellow Nobel laureate Milton Friedman lent his voice to the nation’s shift to the political right in his famous 10-part TV series, Free To Choose. Nowadays, Krugman says, “‘free to choose’ has become ‘free to die.'” He was referring to a GOP presidential debate in which Rep. Ron Paul was asked what should be done if a 30-year-old man who chose not to purchase health insurance found himself in need of six months of intensive care. Paul correctly, but politically incorrectly, replied, “That’s what freedom is all about — taking your own risks.” CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer pressed his question further, asking whether “society should just let him die.” The crowd erupted with cheers and shouts of “Yeah!”, which led Krugman to conclude that “American politics is fundamentally about different moral visions.” Professor Krugman is absolutely right; our nation is faced with a conflict of moral visions. Let’s look at it.

If a person without health insurance finds himself in need of costly medical care, let’s investigate just how might that care be provided. There are not too many of us who’d suggest that we get the money from the tooth fairy or Santa Claus. That being the case, if a medically indigent person receives medical treatment, it must be provided by people. There are several possible methods to deliver the services. One way is for people to make voluntary contributions or for medical practitioners to simply treat medically indigent patients at no charge. I find both methods praiseworthy, laudable and, above all, moral.

Another way to provide those services is for Congress to use its power to forcibly use one person to serve the purposes of another. That is, under the pain of punishment, Congress could mandate that medical practitioners treat medically indigent patients at no charge. I’d personally find such a method of providing medical services offensive and immoral, simply because I find the forcible use of one person to serve the purposes of another, what amounts to slavery, in violation of all that is decent.

I am proud to say that I think most of my fellow Americans would be repulsed at the suggestion of forcibly using medical practitioners to serve the purposes of people in need of hospital care. But I’m afraid that most Americans are not against the principle of the forcible use of one person to serve the purposes of another under the pain of punishment. They just don’t have much stomach to witness it. You say, “Williams, explain yourself.”

Say that citizen John pays his share of the constitutionally mandated functions of the federal government. He recognizes that nothing in our Constitution gives Congress the authority to forcibly use one person to serve the purposes of another or take the earnings of one American and give them to another American, whether it be for medical services, business bailouts, handouts to farmers or handouts in the form of foreign aid. Suppose John refuses to allow what he earns to be taken and given to another. My guess is that Krugman and, sadly, most other Americans would sanction government punishment, imprisonment or initiation of violence against John. They share Professor Krugman’s moral vision that one person has a right to live at the expense of another, but they just don’t have the gall to call it that.

I share James Madison’s vision, articulated when Congress appropriated $$15,000 to assist some French refugees in 1794. Madison stood on the floor of the House to object, saying, “I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of their constituents,” adding later that “charity is no part of the legislative duty of the government.” This vision of morality, I’m afraid, is repulsive to most Americans.

376442,"Humanity stands about halfway between gorillas and gods. The great question that looms over us, is this: “Which will we incorporate into our lives? Gorilla things or God things?”

The choice is ours. Yes, various choices are thrust upon us all our lives, accompanied with various levels of intimidation and threat, but at some point, all of us find ourselves able to choose freely. And it is then that we go in one direction or the other. We are able to change directions of course, but every time we choose, we move a step in one direction or the other.

What We Are

Please understand that I am not endorsing any specific theories here – religious, scientific, or otherwise. I’m merely describing the situation in which humanity finds itself. We are halfway between gorillas and gods: The worst things we do are gorilla-like, and the best things we do are god-like. Either direction is open to us.

Strange as it may seem, we are a lot like apes. Our bodies are built in the same ways, our body chemistry is nearly identical, and the worst aspects of human nature are essentially the same as the worst aspects of primate behavior.

We are also a lot like gods. We transcend entropy; we create. We can touch the soul in others, and the best aspects of human nature are essentially the same as the best characteristics attributed to the gods.

This is not what we can be; this is what we are. What we become in the future depends on whether we choose gorilla things or god things, here and now.

What Are Gorilla and God Things?

Gorilla things are those which operate on a dominant/submissive model. Hierarchy (high-level individuals controlling lower-level individuals) is the blueprint of the gorilla world. Dominant gorillas seek status and the power to control others. The submissive apes seek to pass along their pain to the apes below them (females, juveniles, etc.) and to avoid punishment. They are servile toward the dominants and cruel toward those they are able to dominate. Females trade sex for favors.

God things operate on a creative model. Blessing is the blueprint of the god world: distributing love, honesty, courage, kindness, blessing, awe, gratitude, and respect into the world and to other humans.

So, who runs the world? It's a question that people have struggled with since people began to struggle. It's certainly a question with many interpretations, and incites answers of many varied perspectives.

Often, it is relegated to the realm of u201Cconspiracy theory,u201D in that, those who discuss this question or propose answers to it, are purveyors of a conspiratorial view of the world. However, it is my intention to discard the labels, which seek to disprove a position without actually proving anything to the contrary. One of these labels — u201Cconspiracy theoristu201D — does just that: it's very application to a particular perspective or viewpoint has the intention of u201Cdisproving without proof;u201D all that is needed is to simply apply the label.

What I intend to do is analyse the social structure of the transnational ruling class, the international elite, who together run the world. This is not a conspiratorial opinion piece, but is an examination of the socially constructed elite class of people; what is the nature of power, how does it get used, and who holds it?

A Historical Understanding of Power

In answering the question u201CWho Runs the World?u201D we must understand what positions within society hold the most power, and thus, the answer becomes clear. If we simply understand this as heads of state, the answer will be flawed and inaccurate. We must examine the globe as a whole, and the power structures of the global political economy.

The greatest position of power within the global capitalist system lies in the authority of money-creation: the central banking system. The central banking system, originating in 1694 in England, consists of an international network of central banks that are privately owned by wealthy shareholders and are granted governmental authority to print and issue a nation's currency, and set interest rates, collecting revenue and making profit through the interest charged. Central banks give loans to both governments and industries, controlling both simultaneously. The ultimate centre of power in the central banking system is at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), in Basle, Switzerland; which is the central bank to the world's central banks, and is also a private bank owned by the world's central banks.

As Georgetown University history professor Carroll Quigley wrote:

[T]he powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks which were themselves private corporations.1

The central banks, and thus the central banking system as a whole, is a privately owned system in which the major shareholders are powerful international banking houses. These international banking houses emerged in tandem with the evolution of the central banking system. The central banking system first emerged in London, and expanded across Europe with time. With that expansion, the European banking houses also rose and expanded across the continent.

The French Revolution resulted with Napoleon coming to power, who granted the French bankers a central bank of France, which they privately controlled.2 It was also out of the French Revolution that one of the major banking houses of the world emerged, the Rothschilds. Emerging out of a European Jewish ghetto, the Rothschilds quickly rose to the forefront in banking, and established banking houses in London, Paris, Frankfurt, Vienna and Naples, allowing them to profit off of all sides in the Napoleonic wars.3

As Carroll Quigley wrote in his monumental Tragedy and Hope, u201CThe merchant bankers of London had already at hand in 1810-1850 the Stock Exchange, the Bank of England, and the London money market,u201D and that:

In time they brought into their financial network the provincial banking centres, organised as commercial banks and savings banks, as well as insurance companies, to form all of these into a single financial system on an international scale which manipulated the quantity and flow of money so that they were able to influence, if not control, governments on one side and industries on the other.4

At the same time, in the United States, we saw the emergence of a powerful group of bankers and industrialists, such as the Morgans, Astors, Vanderbilts, Rockefellers, and Carnegies, and they created massive industrial monopolies and oligopolies throughout the 19th century.5 These banking interests were very close to and allied with the powerful European banking houses.

The European, and particularly the British elites of the time, were beginning to organise their power in an effort to properly exert their influence internationally. At this time, European empires were engaging in the Scramble for Africa, in which nearly the entire continent of Africa, save Ethiopia, was colonised and carved up by European nations. One notable imperialist was Cecil Rhodes who made his fortune from diamond and gold mining in Africa with financial support from the Rothschilds,6 and u201Cat that time [had] the biggest concentration of financial capital in the world.u201D7

Cecil Rhodes was also known for his radical views regarding America, particularly in that he would u201Ctalk with total seriousness of u2018the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of the British Empire'.u201D8 Rhodes saw himself not simply as a moneymaker, but primarily as an u201Cempire builder.u201D

As Carroll Quigley explained, in 1891 three British elites met with the intent to create a secret society. The three men were Cecil Rhodes, William T. Stead, a prominent journalist of the day, and Reginald Baliol Brett, a u201Cfriend and confidant of Queen Victoria, and later to be the most influential adviser of King Edward VII and King George V.u201D Within this secret society, u201Creal power was to be exercised by the leader, and a u2018Junta of Three.' The leader was to be Rhodes, and the Junta was to be Stead, Brett, and Alfred Milner.u201D9

The purpose of this secret society, which was later headed by Alfred Milner, was: u201CThe extension of British rule throughout the world, the perfecting of a system of emigration from the United Kingdom and of colonisation by British subjects of all lands wherein the means of livelihood are attainable by energy, labour, and enterprise… [with] the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of a British Empire.u201D [Emphasis added]10 Essentially, it outlined a British-led cosmopolitical world order, one global system of governance under British hegemony. Among key players within this group were the Rothschilds and other banking interests.11

After the 1907 banking panic in the US, instigated by JP Morgan, pressure was placed upon the American political establishment to create a u201Cstableu201D banking system. In 1910, a secret meeting of financiers was held on Jekyll Island, where they planned for the u201Ccreation of a National Reserve Association with fifteen major regions, controlled by a board of commercial bankers but empowered by the federal government to act like a central bank — creating money and lending reserves to private banks.u201D12

It was largely Paul M. Warburg, a Wall Street investment banker, who u201Chad come up with a design for a single central bank [in 1910]. He called it the United Reserve Bank. From this and his later service on the first Federal Reserve Board, Warburg has, with some justice, been called the father of the System.u201D13 President Woodrow Wilson followed the plan almost exactly as outlined by the Wall Street financiers, and added to it the creation of a Federal Reserve Board in Washington, which the President would appoint.14

Thus, true power in the world order was held by international banking houses, which privately owned the global central banking system, allowing them to control the credit of nations, and finance and control governments and industry.

However, though the economic system was firmly in their control, allowing them to establish influence over finance, they needed to shape elite ideology accordingly. In effect, what was required was to socially construct a ruling class, internationally, which would serve their interests. To do this, these bankers set out to undertake a project of establishing think tanks to organise elites from politics, economics, academia, media, and the military into a generally cohesive and controllable ideology.

Constructing a Ruling Class: Rise of the Think Tanks

During World War I, a group of American scholars were tasked with briefing u201CWoodrow Wilson about options for the postwar world once the Kaiser and imperial Germany fell to defeat.u201D This group was called, u201CThe Inquiry.u201D The group advised Wilson mostly through his trusted aide, Col. Edward M. House, who was Wilson's u201Cunofficial envoy to Europe during the period between the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and the intervention by the United States in 1917,u201D and was the prime driving force in the Wilson administration behind the establishment of the Federal Reserve System.15

u201CThe Inquiryu201D laid the foundations for the creation of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the most powerful think tank in the US and, u201CThe scholars of the Inquiry helped draw the borders of post World War I central Europe.u201D On May 30, 1919, a group of scholars and diplomats from Britain and the US met at the Hotel Majestic, where they u201Cproposed a permanent Anglo-American Institute of International Affairs, with one branch in London, the other in New York.u201D When the scholars returned from Paris, they were met with open arms by New York lawyers and financiers, and together they formed the Council on Foreign Relations in 1921. The u201CBritish diplomats returning from Paris had made great headway in founding their Royal Institute of International Affairs.u201D The Anglo-American Institute envisioned in Paris, with two branches and combined membership was not feasible, so both the British and American branches retained national membership, however, they would cooperate closely with one another.16 They were referred to, and still are, as u201CSister Institutes.u201D17

The Milner Group, the secret society formed by Cecil Rhodes, u201Cdominated the British delegation to the Peace Conference of 1919; it had a great deal to do with the formation and management of the League of Nations and of the system of mandates; it founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs in 1919 and still controls it.u201D18

There were other groups founded in many countries representing the same interests of the secret Milner Group, and they came to be known as the Round Table Groups, preeminent among them were the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States, and parallel groups were set up in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India.19

These were, in effect, the first international think tanks, which remain today, and are in their respective nations, among the top, if not the most prominent think tanks.

In 2008, a major study was done by the University of Philadelphia's International Relations Program — the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program — which sought to analyse and examine the most powerful and influential think tanks in the world. While it is a useful resource to understanding the influence of think tanks, there is a flaw in its analysis. It failed to take into account the international origins of the Round Table Group think tanks, particularly the Council on Foreign Relations in the United States; Chatham House or the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London; the Canadian Institute of International Affairs, now renamed the Canadian International Council; and their respective sister organisations in India, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. Further nations have since added to this group of related think tanks, including Germany, and a recently established European Council on Foreign Relations. The report, while putting focus on the international nature of think tanks, analysed these ones as separate institutions without being related or affiliated. This has, in effect, skewed the results of the study. However, it is still useful to examine.

The top think tanks in the United States include the Council on Foreign Relations, (which was put at number 2, however, should be placed at the number 1 spot), the Brookings Institution, (which was inaccurately given the position of number one), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, RAND Corporation, Heritage Foundation, Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the American Enterprise Institute, among others.

The top think tanks in the world, outside of the United States, are Chatham House (sitting at number one), the International Institute for Strategic Studies in the UK, the German Council on Foreign Relations, the French Institute of International Relations, the Adam Smith Institute in the UK, the Fraser Institute in Canada, the European Council on Foreign Relations, the International Crisis Group in Belgium, and the Canadian Institute of International Affairs.20

In 1954, the Bilderberg Group was founded in the Netherlands. Every year since then the group holds a secretive meeting, drawing roughly 130 of the political-financial-military-academic-media elites from North America and Western Europe as u201Can informal network of influential people who could consult each other privately and confidentially.u201D21

Regular participants include the CEOs or Chairmen of some of the largest corporations in the world, oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum, and Total SA, as well as various European monarchs, international bankers such as David Rockefeller, major politicians, presidents, prime ministers, and central bankers of the world.22 The Bilderberg Group acts as a u201Csecretive global think-tank,u201D with an original intent u201Cto link governments and economies in Europe and North America amid the Cold War.u201D23

In 1970, David Rockefeller became Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, while also being Chairman and CEO of Chase Manhattan. In 1970, an academic who joined the Council on Foreign Relations in 1965 wrote a book called Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technetronic Era. The author, Zbigniew Brzezinski, called for the formation of u201CA Community of the Developed Nations,u201D consisting of Western Europe, the United States and Japan. Brzezinski wrote about how u201Cthe traditional sovereignty of nation states is becoming increasingly unglued as transnational forces such as multinational corporations, banks, and international organisations play a larger and larger role in shaping global politics.u201D

So, in 1972, David Rockefeller and Brzezinski u201Cpresented the idea of a trilateral grouping at the annual Bilderberg meeting.u201D In July of 1972, seventeen powerful people met at David Rockefeller's estate in New York to plan for the creation of another grouping. Also at the meeting was Brzezinski, McGeorge Bundy, the President of the Ford Foundation, (brother of William Bundy, editor of Foreign Affairs) and Bayless Manning, President of the Council on Foreign Relations.24 In 1973, these people formed the Trilateral Commission, which acted as a sister organisation to Bilderberg, linking the elites of Western Europe, North America, and Japan into a transnational ruling class.

These think tanks have effectively socially constructed an ideologically cohesive ruling class in each nation and fostered the expansion of international ideological alignment among national elites, allowing for the development of a transnational ruling class sharing a dominant ideology.

These same interests, controlled by the international banking houses, had to socially construct society itself. To do this, they created a massive network of tax-exempt foundations and non-profit organisations, which shaped civil society according to their designs. Among the most prominent of these are the Carnegie Corporation, the Ford Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation.

The u201CFoundationsu201D of Civil Society

These foundations shaped civil society by financing research projects and initiatives into major social projects, creating both a dominant world-view for the elite classes, as well as managing the other classes.

These foundations, since their establishment, played a large part in the funding and organising of the eugenics movement, which helped facilitate this racist, elitist ideology to having enormous growth and influence, ultimately culminating in the Nazi Holocaust. From then, the word u201Ceugenicsu201D had to be dropped from the ideology and philanthropy of elites, and was replaced with new forms of eugenics policies and concepts. Among them, genetics, population control and environmentalism.

These foundations also funded seemingly progressive and alternative media sources in an effort to control the opposition, and manage the resistance to their world order, essentially making it ineffective and misguided.

The Rockefeller Foundation was established in 1912, and immediately began giving money to eugenics research organisations.25 Eugenics was a pseudo-scientific and social science movement that emerged in the late 19th century, and gained significant traction in the first half of the 20th century. One of the founding ideologues of eugenics, Sir Francis Galton, an anthropologist and cousin to Charles Darwin, wrote that eugenics u201Cis the study of all agencies under social control which can improve or impair the racial quality of future generations.u201D26 Ultimately, it was about the u201Csoundu201D breeding of people and maintaining u201Cpurityu201D and u201Csuperiorityu201D of the blood. It was an inherently racist ideology, which saw all non-white racial categories of people as inherently and naturally inferior, and sought to ground these racist theories in u201Cscience.u201D

The vast wealth and fortunes of the major industrialists and bankers in the United States flowed heavily into the eugenics organisations, promoting and expanding this racist and elitist ideology. Money from the Harriman railroad fortune, with millions given by the Rockefeller and Carnegie family fortunes were subsequently u201Cdevoted to sterilisation of several hundred thousands of American u2018defectives' annually, as a matter of eugenics.u201D27

In the United States, 27 states passed eugenics based sterilisation laws of the u201Cunfit,u201D which ultimately led to the sterilisation of over 60,000 people. Throughout the 1920s and 30s, the Carnegie and especially the Rockefeller Foundation, funded eugenics research in Germany, directly financing the Nazi scientists who perpetrated some of the greatest crimes of the Holocaust.28

Following the Holocaust, the word u201Ceugenicsu201D was highly discredited. Thus, these elites who wanted to continue with the implementation of their racist and elitist ideology desperately needed a new name for it. In 1939, the Eugenics Records Office became known as the Genetics Record Office.29 However, tens of thousands of Americans continued to be sterilised throughout the 40s, 50s and 60s, the majority of which were women.30

Edwin Black analysed how the pseudoscience of eugenics transformed into what we know as the science of genetics. In a 1943 edition of Eugenical News, an article titled u201CEugenics After the War,u201D cited Charles Davenport, a major founder of eugenics, in his vision of u201Ca new mankind of biological castes with master races in control and slave races serving them.u201D31

A 1946 article in Eugenical News stated that, u201CPopulation, genetics, [and] psychology, are the three sciences to which the eugenicist must look for the factual material on which to build an acceptable philosophy of eugenics and to develop and defend practical eugenics proposals.u201D As Black explained, u201Cthe incremental effort to transform eugenics into human genetics forged an entire worldwide infrastructure,u201D with the founding of the Institute for Human Genetics in Copenhagen in 1938, led by Tage Kemp, a Rockefeller Foundation eugenicist, and was financed with money from the Rockefeller Foundation.32

Today, much of civil society and major social projects are a product of these foundations, and align with various new forms of eugenics. The areas of population control and environmentalism are closely aligned and span a broad range of intellectual avenues. The major population control organisations emerged with funding from these various foundations, particularly the Rockefeller foundations and philanthropies.

These organisations, such as the Rockefeller and Ford foundations, funded major civil society movements, such as the Civil Rights movement, in an effort to u201Ccreate a wedge between social movement activists and their unpaid grassroots constituents, thereby facilitating professionalisation and institutionalisation within the movement,u201D ultimately facilitating a u201Cnarrowing and taming of the potential for broad dissent,u201D with an aim of limiting goals to u201Cameliorative rather than radical change.u201D33

Two major organisations in the development of the environmental movement were the Conservation Foundation and Resources for the Future, which were founded and funded with money from the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, and helped u201Claunch an explicitly pro-corporate approach to resource conservation.u201D34 Even the World Wildlife Fund was founded in the early 1960s by the former president of the British Eugenics Society, and its first President was Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, a founding member of the Bilderberg Group.

While the environmental movement positions people as the major problem for the earth, relating humanity to a cancer, population control becomes a significant factor in proposing environmental solutions.

In May of 2009, a secret meeting of billionaire philanthropists took place in which they sought to coordinate how to u201Caddressu201D the world's environmental, social, and industrial threats. Each billionaire at the meeting was given 15 minutes to discuss their u201Cpreferredu201D cause, and then they deliberated to create an u201Cumbrellau201D cause to harness all their interests. The end result was that the umbrella cause for which the billionaires would aim to u201Cgive tou201D was population control, which u201Cwould be tackled as a potentially disastrous environmental, social and industrial threat.u201D Among those present at the meeting were David Rockefeller, Jr., George Soros, Warren Buffet, Michael Bloomberg, Ted Turner, Bill Gates, and even Oprah Winfrey.35

Conclusion

At the top of the list of those who run the world, we have the major international banking houses, which control the global central banking system. From there, these dynastic banking families created an international network of think tanks, which socialised the ruling elites of each nation and the international community as a whole, into a cohesive transnational elite class. The foundations they established helped shape civil society both nationally and internationally, playing a major part in the funding — and thus coordinating and co-opting — of major social-political movements.

An excellent example of one member of the top of the hierarchy of the global elite is David Rockefeller, patriarch of the Rockefeller family. Long serving as Chairman and CEO of Chase Manhattan bank, he revolutionised the notion of building a truly global bank. He was also Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, a founding member of Bilderberg and the Trilateral Commission, heavily involved in the family philanthropies, and sits atop a vast number of boards and foundations. Even Alan Greenspan, in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, said that David Rockefeller and the CFR have, u201Cin many respects, formulated the foreign policy of this country.u201D36

In another speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, then World Bank President James Wolfesohn, said in 2005, in honour of David Rockefeller's 90th birthday, that, u201Cthe person who had perhaps the greatest influence on my life professionally in this country, and I'm very happy to say personally there afterwards, is David Rockefeller.u201D He then said, u201CIn fact, it's fair to say that there has been no other single family influence greater than the Rockefeller's in the whole issue of globalisation and in the whole issue of addressing the questions which, in some ways, are still before us today. And for that David, we're deeply grateful to you and for your own contribution in carrying these forward in the way that you did.u201D37

David Rockefeller, himself, wrote, u201CFor more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicised incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterising my family and me as u2018internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure — one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.u201D38

454449,"It is amazing how many different ways the same thing can be said, creating totally different impressions. For example, when President Barack Obama says that defeating ISIS is going to take a long time, how is that different from saying that he is going to do very little, very slowly? It is saying the same thing in different words.

Defenders of the administration’s policies may cite how many aerial sorties have been flown by American planes against ISIS. There have been thousands of these sorties, which sounds very impressive. But what is less impressive — and more indicative — is that, in most of those sorties, the planes have not fired a single shot or dropped a single bomb.

Why? Because the rules of engagement are so restrictive that in most circumstances there is little that the pilot is allowed to do, unless circumstances are just right, which they seldom are in any war. Wealth, Poverty and Po... Thomas Sowell Best Price: $$7.49 Buy New $$19.43 (as of 05:45 EST - Details)

Moreover, the thousands of sorties being flown are still a small fraction of the number of sorties flown in the same amount of time during the Iraq war, when American leaders were serious about getting the war won.

Politics produces lots of words that can mean very different things, if you stop and think about them. But politicians depend on the fact that many people don’t bother to stop and think about them.

We often hear that various problems within the black community are “a legacy of slavery.” That phrase is in widespread use among people who believe in the kinds of welfare state programs that began to dominate government policies in the 1960s.

Blaming social problems today on “a legacy of slavery” is another way of saying, “Don’t blame our welfare state policies for things that got worse after those policies took over. Blame what happened in earlier centuries.”

Nobody would accept that kind of cop-out, if it were expressed that way. But that is why it is expressed differently, as a “legacy of slavery.”

If we were being serious, instead of being political, we could look at the facts. Were the kinds of problems we are concerned about in black communities today as bad during the first century after slavery or in the first generation after the vastly expanded welfare state? Intellectuals and Race Thomas Sowell Best Price: $$11.59 Buy New $$16.93 (as of 05:45 EST - Details)

What about children being raised with no father in the home? As of 1960, nearly a century after slavery ended, 22 percent of black children were being raised in single-parent families.

Thirty years later, 67 percent of all black children were being raised in single-parent families.

What about violence? As of 1960, homicide rates among non-white males had gone down by 22 percent during the preceding decade. But, during the decade of the 1960s, that trend suddenly reversed, and the homicide rate shot up by 76 percent. The welfare state vision was often part of a larger, non-judgmental social vision that was lenient on criminals and hard on the police.

Few people today know that marriage rates and rates of labor force participation were once higher among blacks than among whites — all of this during the first century after slavery. In later years, a reversal occurred, largely in the wake of the welfare state expansions that began in the 1960s.

Another fashionable phrase that evades any need for evidence is “disparate impact” — a legal phrase accepted in the Supreme Court of the United States, despite being downright silly when you stop and think about it.

Whenever there is some standard for being hired, promoted or admitted to a college, some groups may meet that standard more so than others. One way of expressing that is to say that more of the people from group X meet the standard than do people from group Y. But politically correct people express the same thing by saying that the standard has a “disparate impact” on group Y. Once it is expressed this way, it is the standard that is suspect — and whoever set that standard has to prove a negative, namely that he is not guilty of discrimination against group Y. Often nobody can prove anything, so the accused loses — or else settles out of court.

Stupid? No. It takes very clever people to make something like that sound plausible. But it also requires people who don’t bother to stop and think, who enable them to get away with it.

""A neutral mode of taxation is conceivable that would not divert the operation of the market from the lines in which it would develop in the absence of any taxation.""

~ Ludwig von Mises, Human Action (1949)

Economists have long believed that government’s tax and expenditure policy either is, or can readily be made to be, neutral to the market. Free-market economists have advocated such neutrality of government, and even economists favoring redistributive actions by government have believed that the service activities and the redistributive activities of government can easily be distinguished, at least in concept. The purpose of this paper is to examine the nature and implications of fiscally neutral government; the paper argues that all government activities necessarily divert incomes, resources, and assets from the market, and therefore that the quest for a neutral tax or expenditure policy is an impossible one and the concept a myth.

Structure of the Free Market:Consumers and Incomes

To evaluate the idea of a neutral government, we must first define what neutrality to the market may be. Any firm or institution is neutral to the market when it functions as part of the market. That is, both General Motors and Mom and Pop’s Candy Store are part of the market, and insofar as their activities remain within the market, they are neutral to it. [1]

We may analyze market institutions according to the following categories: (a) what and how much they produce, and (b) how much and from where the institution receives monetary funds. For every institution produces goods or services and receives money.

There are two types of market institutions. One is the business firm. The firm is guided by its expectations of monetary income from customers in payment for its products. The firm receives funds from two sources: (b1) customer expenditures, and (b2) entrepreneurial investments. Entrepreneurial investments are monies invested in the firm to purchase or hire factors of production to make goods and services to be sold to customers. The investments are savings spent in anticipation of greater returns from selling products to customers. Although the conspicuous resource and production decisions in the market are made by capitalist-entrepreneurs (by the owners of the firm and its capital assets) these decisions are made in accordance with their expectations of monetary income from customers. In short, businessmen are guided by the quest for monetary profits and the wish to avoid monetary losses, and their forecasting and anticipations must turn out to be good enough to reap profits from their production decisions. The intake of investment funds into the firm, then, is subordinate to the expected profit to be made from sales to customers.

Business firms and the structure of capital assets in the economy, as Austrian school economists have shown, are not a homogeneous lump: Production is a structure of stages, a latticework that moves from the most ""roundabout"" processes of production — the stages of production most remote from the consumers — down to nearer processes, and finally down to the production and sale of goods and services to the ultimate consumers. [2] The ham sandwich at the local coffee shop begins with the mining of ore for tools and machines and the growing of grain to feed hogs, and continues in stage after stage down through the wholesale and retail stages, until it arrives in the maw of the final buyer, the consumer. Thus, for our purposes, we can short-circuit the structure and refer to the consumer as the basic source of the income of business firms; ultimately, it is consumer demand that provides profits or losses to business firms and either vindicates or not prior production decisions by investors.

Investments that bring money into the firm in anticipation of consumer demand, (b2), consist of two parts. The basic investment (b2a) is investment by the owner or owners of the firm in the form of personal savings, partnerships, or investment in corporate stock. Auxiliary investment (b2b) are loans to the owners of the firm by other capitalists, either in the form of short-term credit or long-term debentures. The willingness of the firm’s owners to pay a fixed-interest return to lenders is, of course, a function of their anticipated profit in selling the product to the consumers. Willingness to pay interest will always be less than or equal to the anticipated profit rate; and in the long-run general-equilibrium world of changeless certainty — a world that has never and can never come into existence — the rate of return would be equal throughout the market economy. In that world, the rate of profit in every firm would be equal to the rate of interest on loans. [3]

For market firms, therefore, there is no mystery about the determination of their production decisions and income. The former are determined by firms’ anticipation of consumer demand, and the latter by the reality of that demand. Hence, firms receive their income, in the final analysis, from serving consumers. The more efficiently and ably the firms anticipate and serve consumer demand, the greater their profits; the less ably, the less their profits and the more they suffer losses.

Finally, the owners of the factors of production — land, labor, and capital goods — receive their income in advance of production from the investor-owners of the firm. The more ably and productively a factor or factors are believed to serve consumer demand, the greater the demand for those factors by the owners, and the higher their income. Since capital goods themselves form part of the structure of production, ultimately factor incomes consist of the income from the exertion of labor energy (wages, salaries), the use of land (land rents), and the transfer of money (a present good) in exchange for anticipated future income (a future good) — that will yield interest (or long-run profit) for time preference, and entrepreneurial profits or losses. All these factor incomes then, are tied to the efficient service of anticipated consumer demand. [4]

Incomes to factors and entrepreneurs on the market, therefore, are tied inextricably to the effective satisfaction of consumer demand, a satisfaction that depends on the successful forecasting of the market conditions that will exist when and after the goods or services are produced. Income to the firm and to factors from consumers is linked inextricably to the satisfaction the consumers derive. In a deep sense, therefore, income to producers on the market reflects benefits to consumers.

The crucial point is that when consumers spend, they benefit, because the expenditures are voluntary. The consumers buy product X because they decide that, for whatever reason, it would benefit them to buy that product rather than use the money on some other product or save or add to their cash balances. They give up money for product X because they expect to prefer that product to whatever they could have done with the money elsewhere; their preference reflects a judgment of relative benefit from that, as compared to another, purchase. In my own terms, spending choices by consumers demonstrate their preference for one, as compared to another, way of using their money. [5]

And that is not all. The profit-and-loss tests of the market, the rewarding of effective producers and forecasters and the punishing of ineffective ones, ensures that the overall ability at any time of entrepreneurs to forecast and satisfy consumer demands will be high. Good forecasters will be rewarded with higher profits and incomes; poor forecasters will suffer losses and finally leave the business. So that the market tendency is toward a high level of fit between anticipation and reality, and for a minimum of erroneous investment. Producer income, therefore, reflects consumer benefit even more closely than we might at first realize. [6]

The second type of market institution — after the business firm — is the voluntary nonprofit membership organization: the bridge club, lodge, ideological organization, or charitable agency. Here, too, income and benefit are cognate. Income is no longer divided between investors and consumers. All income is obtained from members, either in the form of regular dues or systematic or occasional donations. The purpose of the organization is not to earn a monetary profit, but to pursue various purposes desired by the income-paying members. In a sense, then, the members are the ""consumers,"" except that they consume the services of the organization not by purchasing a product but by helping the organization pursue its goals. The member-donors are at the same time the consumers and the investors, the consumers and the makers of the production decisions. [7] The organization will employ as much of its resources as the member-consumer-donors desire to contribute to the pursuit of their goals.

Membership organizations, while clearly part of the market, are necessarily limited in their scope, for they do not follow the division of labor necessary for most market production. In virtually all other cases of production, the producers and the consumers are not one and the same: The producers of steel bars do not, Heaven forfend, use up those selfsame bars in their own consumption. They sell the bars for money and exchange the money for other goods that they would like to consume. In the case of membership organizations, however, the member-investors are the consumers of the service.

Even where the explicit goals of the organization are to help non-donors, this rule — that the consumers guiding production decisions are the donors — still applies. Suppose, for example, the organization is a charity giving alms to the poor. In a sense, the purpose is to benefit the poor, but the actual consumers here, the guides to production decisions, are the donors, not the recipients of charity. The charity serves the purposes of the donors, and these purposes are in turn to help the poor. But it is the donors who are consuming, the donors who are demonstrating their preference for sacrificing a lesser benefit (the use of their money elsewhere) for a greater (giving money to the charity to help the poor). It is the donors whose production decisions guide the actions of the charity.

In this case, presumably, the donors themselves will be guided, in their turn, by how effective the organization is in ministering to the poor. But the ways of judging this effectiveness lack the precision of monetary purchase, or profit and loss. They depend on subjective interpretation by the donors, an interpretation that is necessarily subject to a great deal of error. Donors, in the same way, are the consumers regardless of the purpose of the nonprofit organization, whether it is chess playing, medical research, or ideological agitation. In all these cases, precise profit-and-loss tests of effectiveness are lacking; in all these cases, too, donors voluntarily pursue their activity, preferring it to other uses of their resources. [8]

Nonprofit organizations also purchase and hire factors of production. To a large extent, these organizations compete with business firms for factors; to that extent, they must pay the factors at least the discounted marginal product they can earn elsewhere. To some extent, however, the factors may be specific to these organizations; to that extent their marginal product incorporates their service to the donor-consumers, that is, the extent to which they pursue the same goal as the sources of income. Thus, in both the profit-making and the nonprofit sectors, in their different forms, production decisions are guided by service to the consumers. The main difference is that in the case of business firms, the consumers are separate from the producers, and (we hope) recoup producers’ investments by buying the products of the firm; while in nonprofit organizations, the consumers are the donor-investors.

We have been describing two polar cases: the business firm, and the nonprofit organization. Probably most real-world institutions on the market fall into one of these categories. In some cases, however, an organization can partake of both modes. Let us consider two cases. First, a charitable organization, instead of, or in addition to, giving away alms, may sell some products to the poor at a low, subsidized price. In this case, while the donors provide the overall thrust and guidance, part of the feedback gained by the firm is willingness to buy goods by the recipients. In some sense, the recipients of alms provide a guide to their interest in the organization. There are now two sets of consumers: the donors, and the charity recipients, each of whom demonstrates its preference for this organization in contrast to other uses for its money. [9] But the overall purpose of the organization is not to make a profit, but rather to serve the values and goals of the donors, and so the donors must be considered the regnant consumers in this situation.

Another case is a profit-making business firm where the owner or owners decide to accept a lesser monetary profit on behalf of some other goals of the owners: for example, because a certain line of product is considered immoral by the owners or because the owner wishes to hire incompetent relatives in order to keep peace in the family. Here once again, these are two sets of consumers — the buyers of the product, and the producers or owners themselves. Because of his own values as a ""consumer,"" the owner decides to forego monetary profit because of his own moral principles or because he holds keeping peace in the family high on his value scale. In either case, the owner is foregoing some monetary profit in order to achieve psychic profit. Which motive will dominate depends on the facts of each particular case. Since the market is generally characterized by a division of labor between producers and consumers, however, the general tendency will be for monetary profit, or service to non-owning consumers, to dominate the decisions of business firms. [10]

It is a basic fact that all voluntary actions are undertaken because actors expect to benefit from them. When two persons make a voluntary exchange of goods or services, they do so because each expects to benefit from the exchange. When A trades commodity X for B’s commodity Y, A is demonstrating a preference — an expected net benefit — for Y over X, while B is demonstrating the opposite, a preference for X over Y. The free market is a vast latticework of two-person (or two-group) exchanges, an array of mutually beneficial exchanges up and down and across the structure of production. [11]

Robbery and the Market

Having dealt with this idyll of harmonious and mutually beneficial exchanges, let us now introduce a discordant note. A thief now appears, making his living by robbing and coercively preying on others: The robber obtains his income by presenting the victim with a choice: your money or your life (or, at least, your health) — and the victim then yields his assets. Or, to be more precise, the robber presents the victim with a choice between paying immediately or waiting until the robber injures him. [12] In this situation both parties do not benefit; instead, the robber benefits precisely at the expense of the victim. Instead of the consumer’s paying, guiding, and being benefited by the producer’s activity, the robber is benefiting from the victim’s payment. The robber benefits to the extent that the victim pays and loses. Instead of helping expand the amount and degree of production in society, the robber is parasitically draining off that production. Whereas an expanded market encourages increases in production and supply, theft discourages production and contracts the market.

It should be clear that the robber is not producing any goods and services at all. In contrast to consumers who purchase goods and services, or who contribute voluntarily to a nonprofit organization, no one is voluntarily purchasing from or contributing to our criminals at all. If they were, the criminals would not be criminal. In fact, what distinguishes a criminal group is that its income, in contrast to that of all other organizations, is extracted by the use of violence, against the wishes or consent of the victims. The criminals, then, are ""producing"" nothing, except their own income at the expense of others.

It has been maintained that the payments by the victims are ""really"" voluntary because the victim decides to transfer his funds under penalty of violence by the robber. This kind of sophistry, however, destroys the original, as well as the common-sense, meaning of the term ""coercion"" and renders all actions whatever ""voluntary."" But if there is no such thing as coercion and all conceivable actions are voluntary, then the distinctive meaning of both terms is destroyed. In this paper, we are defining ""voluntary"" and ""coercion"" in a common-sense way: that is, ""voluntary"" are all actions not taken under the threat of coercion; and ""coercion"" is the use of violence or threat of violence to compel actions of others. Robbery at gunpoint, then, is ""coercion""; the universal need to work and produce is not. In a trivial sense, the victim agrees to be victimized rather than lose his life; but surely, to call such a choice or decision ""voluntary"" is a corruption of ordinary language. In contrast to truly voluntary decisions, where each person is better off than he was before the prospect of exchange came into view, the robbery victim is simply struggling to cut his losses, for, in any case, he is worse off because of the entry of the robber onto the scene than he was before.

Just as the claim that the victim’s payment to the thief is ""voluntary"" is patently sophistical, so is it absurd to claim that the robber is ""producing"" some service to the victim or anyone else. The fact that the victim paid him revenue proves no demonstrated preference or value; it proves only that the victim prefers the imposition to being shot.

The robber may well spin elaborate arguments for his productivity and for his alleged benefit to the victim. He may claim that by extracting money he is providing the victim a defense from other robbers. In attempting to achieve and maintain his monopoly of loot, he may very well act against other robbers trying to muscle in on his territory. But this ""service"" scarcely demonstrates his productivity to the victims. Only if the victims pay the robber voluntarily can any case be made for a nexus of payment and benefit. Since payments are now coercive instead of voluntary, since the consumer has now become the victim, all arguments offered by the criminal and his apologists about why the victim should have been eager to pay the criminal voluntarily are in vain, for the stark and overriding fact is that these payments are compulsory.

The robber takes the funds extracted from the victims and spends them for his own consumption purposes. The total revenue collected by theft we may call tribute; the expenditures of the robbers, apart from the small sums spent on burglars’ tools, weapons, planning, and so on, are consumption expenses by the robbers. In this way, just as income and assets are diverted from the productive sector to the robbers, so the robbers are able to use that money (in their purchasing) to extract productive resources from the market.

We conclude, then, that the activities of thieves are most emphatically not neutral to the market. In fact, the robbers divert income and resources from the market by the use of coercive violence, and thereby skew and distort production, income, and resources from what they would have been in the absence of coercion. If, on the contrary, we adhere to the view that theft is voluntary and criminals productive, then criminal activities, too, would be neutral to the market, in which case the entire problem of neutrality would disappear by semantic legerdemain, and everything by definition would be neutral to the market because the rubric of the market would encompass all conceivable activities of man. In that case, nothing could be called ""intervention"" into the market. By labeling aggressive violence as ""coercion"" and as an interference into the market, we avoid this kind of absurd trap, and we cleave closely to the commonsense view of such concepts as ""coercion,"" ""voluntary,"" ""market,"" and ""intervention.""

Government as Robber

We are now in a position to analyze government and its relationship to the market. Economists have generally depicted the government as a voluntary social institution providing important services to the public. The modern ""public choice"" theorists have perhaps gone furthest with this approach. Government is considered akin to a business firm, supplying its services to the consumer-voters, while the voters in turn pay voluntarily for these services. All in all, government is treated by conventional economists as a part of the market, and therefore, as in the case of a business firm or a membership organization, either totally or in part neutral to the market.

It is true that if taxation were voluntary and the government akin to a business firm, the government would be neutral to the market. We contend here, however, that the model of government is akin, not to the business firm, but to the criminal organization, and indeed that the State is the organization of robbery systematized and writ large. The State is the only legal institution in society that acquires its revenue by the use of coercion, by using enough violence and threat of violence on its victims to ensure their paying the desired tribute. The State benefits itself at the expense of its robbed victims. The State is, therefore, a centralized, regularized organization of theft. Its payments extracted by coercion are called ""taxation"" instead of tribute, but their nature is the same. The German sociologist Franz Oppenheimer saw this clearly when he wrote that

there are two fundamentally opposed means whereby man, requiring sustenance, is impelled to obtain the necessary means for satisfying his desires. These are work and robbery, one’s own labor and the forcible appropriation of the labor of others.. .. I propose .. . to call one’s own labor and the equivalent exchange of one’s own labor for the labor of others, the ""economic means"" forthe satisfaction of needs, while the unrequited appropriation of the labor of others will be called the ""political means."" [13]

Oppenheimer then proceeded to identify the State as the ""organization of the political means."" [14] Or, as the libertarian writer Albert Jay Nock, vividly put it: ""The State claims and exercises the monopoly of crime…. It forbids private murder, but itself organizes murder on a colossal scale. It punishes private theft, but itself lays unscrupulous hands on anything it wants, whether the property of citizen or alien."" [15] Or, as Ludwig von Mises points out, this regularization establishes a systematic coercive hegemonic bond between the rulers of the State and the subject that contrasts vividly with the contractual bond of mutual benefit.

There are two different kinds of social cooperation: cooperation by virtue of contract and coordination, and cooperation by virtue of command and subordination or hegemony. Where and as far as cooperation is based on contract, the logical relation between the cooperating parties is symmetrical. They are all parties to interpersonal exchange contracts. John has the same relation to Tom as Tom has to John. Where and as far as cooperation is based on command and subordination, there is the man who commands and there are those who obey his order. The logical relation between these two classes of men is asymmetrical. There is a director and there are people under his care. The director alone chooses and directs; the others — the wards — are mere pawns in his actions. [16]

In this coercive, hegemonic condition, the individual must either accept the orders of the ruler or rebel. To the extent that the person submits, this choice then subjects him to the continuing hegemony of the rulers of the State. Contrasting the contractual and the hegemonic, Mises states:

In the frame of a contractual society the individual members exchange definite quantities of goods and services of a definite quality. In choosing subjection in a hegemonic body a man neither gives nor receives anything that is definite. He integrates himself into a system in which he has to render indefinite services and will receive what the director is willing to assign to him. He is at the mercy of the director. The director alone is free to choose. Whether the director is an individual or an organized group of individuals, a directorate, and whether the director is a selfish maniacal tyrant or a benevolent paternal despot is of no relevance for the structure of the whole system. [17]

Mises goes on to contrast the system of contractual coordination that is responsible for much of the achievements of Western civilization with the hegemonic system embodied in the State, ""an apparatus of compulsion and coercion… by necessity a hegemonic organization."" [18]

The idea that taxation is voluntary seems to be endemic among economists and social scientists, though hardly so among the general public. [19] But if an individual refuses to pay his assigned tax, coercion will be wielded against him, and if he resists the confiscation of his property he will be shot or jailed. Failure to pay taxes subjects one to civil and criminal penalties. There should be little need to pursue the matter beyond this, were not economists determined to deny this patently obvious fact. As Joseph Schumpeter trenchantly declared: ""The theory which construes taxes on the analogy of club dues or of the purchases of, say, a doctor only proves how far removed this part of the social sciences is from scientific habits of mind."" [20]

But if taxation is coercive and a system of organized theft, then any ""services"" that the government may supply to its subjects are beside the point, for they do not establish the government as voluntary or as part of the market any more than a criminal band’s providing the ""service"" of defending its victims from competing bands establishes that its services are voluntarily paid for. These services are not voluntarily paid for by the taxpayers, and we therefore cannot say that the taxes measure or reflect any sort of benefit. In the case of voluntary purchase on the market, as we have seen, the consumer demonstrates by his purchase that he values the good or service he buys more than the price he pays; but in paying taxes he demonstrates no such thing — only the desire not to be the recipient of further violence by the State. We have no idea how much the taxpayers would value these services, if indeed they valued them at all. For example, suppose that the government levies a tax of X dollars on A, B, C, and so on, for police protection — for protection, that is, against irregular, competing looters and not against itself. The fact that A is forced to pay $$1,000 is no indication that $$1,000 in any sense gauges the value to A of police protection. It is possible that he values it very little, and would value it less if he could turn to competing defense agencies. Moreover, A may be a pacifist; so he may consider the State’s police protection a net harm rather than a benefit. But one thing we do know: If these payments to government were voluntary, we can be sure that they would be substantially less than present total tax revenue. Why? Because if people were willing to pay voluntarily, then there would be no need for the apparatus of coercion so intimately wrapped up in taxation.

A second important point is that, in contrast to the market, where consumers pay for received benefits (or, in nonprofit organizations, where members pay for psychic benefits), the State, like the robber, creates a total disjunction between benefit and payment. The taxpayer pays; the benefits are received, first and foremost, by the government itself, and secondarily, by those who receive the largess of government expenditures.

But if, under coercive taxation, tax payments far exceed benefits to the victim, and if benefits accrue to the government itself and to the recipients of its expenditures at the expense of taxpayers, then it should be quite clear that it is impossible for taxes ever to be neutral to the market. Taxation, whatever its size or incidence, must distort market processes, must alter the allocation and distribution of assets, incomes, and resources.

The Alleged Voluntariness of Taxation

Despite the fact that government and taxation are patently coercive, economists have devoted considerable energy, in numerous ways, to maintaining the contrary. If government and taxation were truly voluntary, then taxation would be akin to a market payment, and government could be deemed a part of, and therefore neutral to, the market.

By lumping government along with private expenditures as a gauge of the output of the economy, the conventional national income statisticians are implicitly assuming that government is neutral to the market because government provides those ""services"" that ""society"" desires it to supply. Government ""output"" is equated to the salaries paid to the bureaucracy. By employing the seemingly precise method of segregating some government expenses as mere ""transfer payments"" — the taxing of Peter to pay Paul — rather than productive purchases of goods and services, the national income statisticians are in reality making an unsupportable ideological judgment. For in what sense does the hiring of bureaucrats, or the purchasing of paper clips, add to the production of the economy and therefore become somehow voluntary, while transfer payments are frankly taxing one group to subsidize another? As we shall see further below, all taxation necessarily involves taking from one group to subsidize another; therefore all government expenditures, taken together, constitute one giant transfer payment.

Even if one does not go that far, it is a rare person who would not concede that at least 50 percent of government expenditures are sheer waste, which would mean that they should not form part of the estimated national product at all. Despite his recognition of this fact, as well as the shakiness of ranking government expenses along with market expenditures, Sir John Hicks finally sees no alternative. He puts it this way:

I can see no alternative but to assume that the public services are worth to society in general at least what they cost…. One may feel considerable qualms about such an assumption — it is obvious that the government spends far too much on this, far too little on that: but if we accept the actual choices of the individual consumer as reflecting his preferences… then I do not see that we have any choice but to accept the actual choices of the government, even if they are expressed through a Nero or a Robespierre, as representing the actual wants of society. [21]

Elsewhere, Hicks explains that in constructing national product figures, ""the social accountant … must work upon some convention which is independent of his individual judgment."" [22] It is remarkable that Hicks can find security from the shoals of individual judgment in assuming that Nero or Robespierre embody ""the actual wants of society."" Can he really believe that this fictive ""society"" and its head of State adequately represent the preferences of individual citizens?

Collective Goods

More intellectually respectable is the contention that insofar as government supplies society with ""collective goods"" or ""public goods,"" it is supplying a necessary service and is in a sense voluntary and neutral to the market. Collective goods are goods that allegedly cannot be supplied on the private market because they are indivisible and therefore cannot be allocated by having individual consumers pay for their own portions of the product. No consumer can be excluded from receiving the good. Like the sun, collective goods shine on all alike, and none can be made to pay for the service. Professor Buchanan, sympathetic to the idea of an ""ideally neutral fiscal system,"" defines it as one that ""uniquely aims at providing the social group with some ‘optimal’ or ‘efficient’ quantity of collective goods and services."" Then, if ""the fiscal system is conceived as the means through which collective goods and services are provided to members of the society without any subsidiary or supplementary social purposes,"" we have, says Buchanan, an ""analogy with the market economy."" The fiscal system is then ""ideally neutral"" to the market economy. [23]

In the first place, even if there were such things as collective goods, government supply would establish neither its voluntarism nor its neutrality. Even if there were no other way to supply these services, taxation to provide them is still compulsory. And since it is coercive, there is no standard, as there is on the market, to decide how much of these services to supply by taxation. And the more the government provides, the less people are allowed to spend on their own private consumption.

Furthermore, if there exists but one anarchist in any society, the very existence of the State coercively supplying a collective good constitutes a great psychic harm to that anarchist. The anarchist, therefore, receives not a collective service but an individual harm from the operations of the State. It follows therefore that the good or service cannot be truly collective; its ""service"" is separable, and distinctly negative, to the anarchists. Hence, the good can neither be truly collective (indivisible, and positive) nor can it be voluntary. [24]

No matter how ""divisible"" the service, furthermore, a collective good is not quite like the sun: The more resources the government expends, the greater will be its output. These resources will have to be extracted from other potential products. Take, for example, ""defense"" or police protection, which is often considered to be provided as a homogeneous lump to everyone. But every good or service in the world, ""collective"" ones included, is provided, not in lump sum, but in marginal units. Yet strangely, economists, trained to think of marginal units everywhere else, suddenly start referring to defense as a ""lump"" when discussing government. In reality, however, there is a vast range of ""defense"" services that the government (or any other defense agency) could supply to its customers. To take two polar extremes, the government could supply one unarmed policeman for an entire country, or it could sink most of the national product into providing an armed bodyguard, replete with tank and flame throwers, for every citizen. The question that must be answered by any defense agency is not whether or not to supply defense, but how much defense to supply to whom? In the same way, the question confronting a steel company is not whether or not to produce steel, but how much steel of various grades and types to supply.

But this failure to provide rational criteria for amounts and types of collective services is an inherent flaw in any provision by government. The market’s price system and profit-and-loss test tell private firms how much of what kind of steel to produce; rational criteria for satisfying consumers most efficiently are inherent in the free market. But government can have no such criteria. Since the consumers of defense do not pay for the service, since taxes do not measure the service, and since the government does not have to worry about losses that can be recouped by further taxation, there are no criteria of how much defense to provide to whom. Decisions are purely arbitrary, as well as coercive. If, on the other hand, defense were provided by private firms on the market, then these firms would, as in the rest of the market, supply efficiently the amounts and types of protection desired by particular customers. Those customers, for example, who desired and were willing to pay for round-the-clock bodyguards would do so; those who felt no need for protection — or pacifists aghast at the very idea — would pay nothing; and there might be a large spectrum of services in between.

More specifically: Only a minority of specific individuals find themselves in actual need of police or judicial protection during any given period. If A and B are attacked, the police can spring to the aid of these specific persons. It will be objected that even if only a few persons are actually attacked at any one time, no one can determine who will be attacked in the future, and so everyone will want to be sure of protection in advance, thus salvaging the notion of a ""collective want."" But, again, there will be a spectrum of opinion among individuals. Some persons may feel pretty sure that they will not be attacked, and will therefore be willing to opt out of protection, to take their chance rather than pay a protection tax. Others will be confident of their own ability to repulse an attack, or would only patronize another, competing private defense agency. Others may fear an attack so little that the cost of paying protection will not be worth the benefit. On the free market, individuals would be free to choose any or none of these protection-insurance packages.

Even if it be conceded that not all people demand protection, it might still be argued that defense is a ""collective good"" because no one can be excluded from receiving its benefits. But surely if the inhabitants of a particular block refuse to pay for the police protection, the police may simply exclude that block from its patrols or other services. In the case of judicial protection, the conventional case for a collective good is even weaker. For surely a court, financed by voluntary payment (either by insurance premium or by fee-for-service), can refuse to hear the case of a nonpaying plaintiff. Even in the case of national defense, which seems to be a particularly strong example of a collective good, the pacifist or anarchist receives a harm rather than a good, and exclusion can be practiced in such ways as not rushing troops or planes to defend nonpaying areas, or at the very least not to defend them as rapidly and as diligently as areas that do pay.

Thus defense cannot be a collective good so long as only one pacifist or one anarchist exists in the society, for these persons will receive a harm rather than a benefit when they receive the ""service"" of coercive defense. And defense is not a collective good because its recipients can be excluded and separated.

Professor Kenneth Goldin is one of the very few economists to recognize that defense service is separable and not indivisible. He also points out that increased police service requires increased expense:

As communities grow, and more residents must be supplied with crime defense, most communities hire more policemen; clearly an increased cost. If more policemen are not hired, then new residents can be served only by decreasing service to others: more streets can be patrolled only if there are fewer patrols at night; more properties can be checked only if each one is checked less thoroughly, and only the more urgent calls can be responded to. Each of these service changes imposes costs on residents. Either they will suffer from more crime, or they will incur the costs of purchasing other types of crime defense. Many types of crime defense are selectively available such as locks, fences, guard dogs, guards, and also alarm companies which respond if the burglar alarm is tripped. And don’t overlook private police patrols, which check selected houses on selected streets, as thoroughly and as often as each customer requests, for a fee. [25]

Court services are clearly separable, and private arbitrators are indeed generally more efficient than government courts. Goldin adds:

To service more persons generally requires more judges and courtrooms. If more facilities are not acquired, additional users will impose costs on others, in the form of longer days for trial and/or less judicial time spent on each case. It is costless to serve additional persons only if they have no disputes.

To some extent, he goes on, even government courts charge fees to users and therefore charge for benefits received, although the fees usually do not vary with the difficulty of the case. And ""private arbitrators are also available, selectively, to those parties willing to pay a fee. So, although adjudication is a fundamental service in any society, it does not follow that adjudication is a public good."" [26]

And even in the case of national defense, Goldin points out,

there is certainly some variation in protection, especially among cities (regarding protection by missiles), and among Americans who either travel or have property abroad. While the troops may be sent out to protect some Americans or their property from some foreign seizures (such as the Mayaguez), in other cases no action is taken (tuna boats). One of the firmly embedded myths of modern public finance is that it doesn’t matter if population increases: The costs of defending the U.S. from external attack will not change. But consider two points. First, the new population must live somewhere. If they cause an increase in the U.S. land area, then either more defenses must be provided, or there will be a decrease in the level of protection to earlier residents and either way the marginal cost of protecting additional persons is positive…. Second, even if the new population resides within the existing boundaries, they will generally increase the amount of physical and human wealth which might be coveted by an enemy. That is, foreign attack is (at least partially) an economically motivated action, and is more likely to occur if there is more capital worth coveting. [27]

Not only does total cost of national defense vary with population, but the service of protection against foreign attack can be variable. First, there once existed private armies, and such armies, serving private individuals or groups, still exist today. Goldin mentions the armies of religious groups in contemporary Lebanon, as well as a Central American army owned by Robert Vesco. These armies, as Goldin states, ""yield benefits primarily to their owner."" [28]

Second, even a collective State army can vary its services to individual citizens:

A military force also protects people from theft of property and kidnapping by foreigners. Exclusion from this service is relatively easy: The military force simply makes no attempt to stop theft or kidnapping of named persons. These persons would either hire their own guards, or suffer the damages of theft or kidnapping by foreigners…. Americans with substantial property abroad or at sea might well prefer to provide their own anti-theft defenses, rather than pay for a communal army which cannot be counted on to protect their property…. Contrary to public goods theory, even in this key case of defense from external attack, exclusion is not impossible and the marginal cost of serving additional persons generally is not zero. [29]

Moreover, as Buchanan concedes, a collective defense may be a service to one citizen and be considered a distinctly negative ""service"" by another:

The common availability of collective goods or services does not, of course, imply that similar evaluations are placed on these by different persons. The Vietnam War effort demonstrated this point. The services of the plane that bombed North Vietnam in October, 1968, were equally available to all U.S. citizens. But the value placed on these services may have ranged from significantly positive levels … to significantly negative levels for those who felt that continued bombing was both immoral and a barrier to peace negotiations. [30]

To Professor Buchanan, the ""classic"" example of a collective good is the lighthouse. The beams of the lighthouse are indivisible: ""If one boat gets all the light beams, all boats may do likewise."" [31] Or, as Samuelson has put it, ""A businessman could not build it for a profit, since he cannot claim a price from each user."" [32] The theory is that it would be virtually impossible for a lighthouse keeper to row out to each boat to demand payment for use of the light. And that hence lighthouses have always been supplied by government.

But, first, the problem has now been eliminated by modern technology. It is now technologically highly feasible for a lighthouse’s rays to be available only to that boat that has the proper electronic equipment, and to pay a fee for the use of that equipment. But, apart from this, it turns out, as Ronald Coase has discovered, that from the seventeenth until the early nineteenth centuries, the British lighthouse system was developed and operated by private enterprise. The lighthouse owners hardly bothered about collecting a fee from each boat on the spot. Instead, the owners employed agents at ports who found out what routes each ship entering the port had sailed and therefore what lighthouses the ship had passed and charged them accordingly. [33] Furthermore, additional users of lighthouses will impose higher costs for providing them. More ships will increase the likelihood of congestion in the protected waters and will require more navigational aids. [34]

In his trenchant critique of the offhanded way in which economists, from Mill to Samuelson and Arrow, have wrongly used the lighthouse as an example of a collective good, Coase concludes:

These references by economists to lighthouses are not the result of their having made a study of lighthouses or having read a detailed study by some other economist. Despite the extensive use of the lighthouse example in the literature, no economist, to my knowledge, has ever made a comprehensive study of lighthouse finance and administration. The lighthouse is simply plucked out of the air to serve as an illustration….

This seems to me to be the wrong approach…. [G]eneralizations are not likely to be helpful unless they are derived from studies of how such activities are actually carried out within different institutional frameworks….

The account in this paper of the British lighthouse system … shows that, contrary to the belief of many economists, a lighthouse service can be provided by private enterprise…. The lighthouses were built, operated, financed and owned by private individuals, who could sell the lighthouse or dispose of it by bequest. The role of the government was limited to the establishment and enforcement of property rights in the lighthouse. The charges were collected at ports by agents from the lighthouses. The problem of enforcement was no different for them than for other suppliers of goods and services to the shipowner. [35]

The analogous navigational aid for air traffic, the services of the air-control tower, can be and is sold separately to individual consumers. Control towers will distribute radar information, for example, to whoever has radar equipment, but the equipment must be purchased by individual users. And heavier use of airspace or airport runways requires more navigational aids and therefore more expenses to service the users. [36]

Radio and television have been cited as collective goods since servicing another viewer allegedly involves no additional cost. But additional service is far from costless, and viewers are separable and excludable; therefore radio and TV fail both tests of a collective good. An increased viewing audience means supplying more, and more varied, programs. And new users must either be supplied with a stronger signal or may require cable or stronger antennas because of the increased congestion. Moreover, consumers are excluded now from television. To watch television programs they must buy sets and then must either pay as they go (various forms of pay TV) or else advertisers must pay, imposing on many viewers the psychic costs of commercials. And public television imposes on its viewers the psychic costs of being subjected to lengthy requests for donations. [37]

Moreover, in a sense the collective goods case for radio and television proves too much. For movies may also be said to be ""costless"" if additional viewers fill empty seats in a theater. Must movies, too, be nationalized, be supplied only by government, and perhaps be free to all?

Again, this argument proves too much. For not only patents and inventions are produced by creators: There is also art, sculpture, music, literature, philosophy. Are we to say that all these products of the human spirit are ""collective goods"" because we cannot be fully excluded from enjoying the products of Beethoven, Shakespeare, or Vermeer? Must all artists therefore be nationalized?

Another commonly cited example of a collective good is insect control by airplane spraying. It is alleged to be impossible to exclude land underneath from being sprayed, and the marginal cost of adding more land sprayed is zero. But if new residents live in previously uninhabited areas, then extra cost is incurred in servicing them, and the same is true if they are engaged in activities that attract insects. More airplane time and fuel must be used as well as more spray. Furthermore, the airplane could often, if it wished, exclude specific parcels of land from its spray. And more important, many of those receiving this ""service"" have not wanted it and have objected to the spraying as vigorously as the pacifist has protested the use of violence in defense. Indeed, a shift in public attitudes toward chemical sprays has greatly reduced their use in recent years. But if some people consider a service such as a spray as ""bad,"" how can it be an indivisible, positive collective good?

Moreover, as Goldin points out, individual consumers have another option: to buy their own spray guns and spray their own property. In that case, each individual could choose and pay for the type and amount of spray that he precisely desires. [39]

For many reasons, then, there are no collective goods, and even if there were, as we have already seen, their supply would be coercive if furnished by government and taxation. But there is yet another vital point: For even if a good or service could only be supplied ""collectively,"" why must that collection be compulsory? Why couldn’t individuals pool their resources voluntarily, as in club dues, and make voluntary contributions for the supply of the service? [40] Or, as Gustave de Molinari argued, couldn’t a government even contract for the supply of collective services with private, competitive, and therefore more efficient firms? [41]

Or, as Spencer Heath urged, on the model of real estate developments, shopping centers, and hotels, couldn’t such ""collective"" or ""public"" goods as police, fire, roads, sanitation, and so on, be supplied by a large private firm with tenants paying for these services in their rents? [42]

Finally, if we look at human history, we find that every good, without exception, that economists glibly term a ""collective good"" has actually been successfully supplied by the free market. Not only do private guards and patrols exist, and private lighthouses in the past, but there have been societies, such as medieval Ireland, that supplied a complex network of defense service and insurance — including police, crime insurance, and competitive courts — without a State or taxation. Competing market courts serviced for centuries the vitally important fairs of Champagne in the Middle Ages. Common-law courts were marked by competitive, nongovernmentally appointed judges. Private guards and private arbitrators exist successfully even in our society where the State monopolizes most forms of defense. [43]

It seems clear, then, that voluntary rather than governmental supply of the collective good would be possible in every case; the only objection might be, not that the good — defense, firefighting, or whatever — could not be supplied, but that ""too little"" would be supplied. But that brings us to the second line of argument by the proponents of government.

External Benefits

If forced to retreat from the ""strong"" concept of collective goods, the advocates of government supply or subsidization of such goods, fall back on a ""weak,"" and therefore more plausible argument. Even though every collective good might be furnishable by private means, ""not enough"" will be supplied because of the difficulty or impossibility of capturing enough payment from ""free riders"" who benefit from these services without paying for their benefits. Government supply, or taxation of free riders to subsidize supplies, then becomes required in order to ""internalize the external benefits"" acquired, but not paid for, by the free riders. [44]

But this argument generates far more difficulties than it solves. It proves too much in many directions. In the first place, how much of the deficient good should be supplied? What criterion can the State have for deciding the optimal amount and for gauging by how much the market provision of the service falls short? Even if free riders benefit from collective service X, in short, taxing them to pay for producing more will deprive them of unspecified amounts of private goods Y, Z, and so on. We know from their actions that these private consumers wish to continue to purchase private goods Y, Z, and so on, in various amounts. But where is their analogous demonstrated preference for the various collective goods? We know that a tax will deprive the free riders of various amounts of their cherished private goods, but we have no idea how much benefit they will acquire from the increased provision of the collective good; and so we have no warrant whatever for believing that the benefits will be greater than the imposed costs. The presumption should be quite the reverse. And what of those individuals who dislike the collective goods, pacifists who are morally outraged at defensive violence, environmentalists who worry over a dam destroying snail darters, and so on? In short, what of those persons who find other people’s good their ""bad?"" Far from being free riders receiving external benefits, they are yoked to absorbing psychic harm from the supply of these goods. Taxing them to subsidize more defense, for example, will impose a further twofold injury on these hapless persons: once by taxing them, and second by supplying more of a hated service.

Since the tax-and-subsidy, or government-operation, route abandons the process of the market, there is no way of knowing who the ""negative free riders"" are, and how much they will be suffering from an increased tax. We do have a pretty good idea, however, that one or more of these people exists: that there is at least one pacifist, anti-dam environmentalist, anarchist opposed to all government actions, and so on, in every society. But in that case, the free-rider as well as the ""stronger"" collective-good argument for the neutrality of government falls to the ground.

The young Herbert Spencer, in his great treatise Social Statics, declared that an individual should be able to opt out of taxation, to ""ignore the State,"" and to renounce its services. [45] Criticizing his own work a half-century later, Spencer, in his Autobiography, employs the free-rider argument. ""Mr. Spencer,"" he charges,

actually contends that the citizen may properly refuse to pay taxes, if at the same time he surrenders the advantages which State aid and State protection yield him! But how can he surrender them? In whatever way he maintains himself, he must make use of sundry appliances which are indirectly due to governmental organization; and he cannot avoid benefiting by the social order which government maintains. Even if he lives on a moor and makes shoes, he cannot sell his goods or buy the things he wants without using the road to the neighboring town, and profiting by the paving and perhaps the lighting when he gets there. And, though he may say he does not want police guardianship, yet, in keeping down footpads and burglars, the police necessarily protect him, whether he asks them or not. Surely it is manifest … that the citizen is so entangled in the organization of his own society that he can neither escape the evils nor relinquish the benefits which come to him from it. [46]

The later Spencer was properly refuted, on his own earlier grounds, by ""S.R."" ""S.R."" points out first that on the later Spencer’s own grounds, a man at least has the right to refuse to pay for advantages that he can relinquish. ""S.R."" then quotes from the earlier Spencer’s application of his ""law of equal freedom"":

If every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man, then he is free to stop connection with the State — to relinquish its protection and to refuse paying toward its support. It is self-evident that in so behaving he in no way trenches upon the liberty of others; for his position is a passive one, and while passive he cannot become an aggressor.. .. He cannot be coerced into a political combination without a breach of the law of equal freedom; he can withdraw from it without committing any such breach; and he therefore has the right to withdraw.

""S.R."" then proceeds: ""Is a man who refuses to pay for incidental advantages he has not solicited an aggressor? Is it a breach of the law of equal freedom to withdraw from a combination that, in working for itself and pursuing its own benefit, indirectly benefits one who is perfectly willing to forego the blessings of the uninvited beneficence?"" ""S.R."" then points out that Spencer is implicitly modifying his equal freedom formula to say that anyone can do whatever he wishes, provided not only that he does not infringe on anyone else’s freedom, but also provided ""that no one confers upon him benefits which he cannot wholly surrender while remaining a producer and trader.""

""S.R."" then tellingly supplies the logical reductio of the free-rider argument:

Has an individual the right to withhold proper contributions from neighbors who, individually or collectively, benefit him by caring for their own interests? If my neighbors hire private watchmen, they benefit me indirectly and incidentally. If my neighbors build fine houses or cultivate gardens, they indirectly minister to my pleasure. Are they entitled to tax me for these benefits because I cannot ""surrender"" them? [47]

Thus the free-rider argument proves far too much. After all, civilization itself is a process of all of us ""free-riding"" on the achievements of others. We all free-ride, every day, on the achievements of Edison, Beethoven, or Vermeer. When capital investment increases, and technology improves, the real wages of workers and the standard of living of consumers increase, even though they have contributed nothing to these advances. By simply continuing to work and consume, laborers and consumers receive the benefits of the inventions and investments of others without paying for them. So what must we infer from this? Are we all to wear sackcloth and ashes? If our neighbors are wiser, prettier, or happier, we all benefit in countless ways. So what must we do about it? Must we all be taxed to subsidize their beauty and wisdom?

And if people feel that not enough beauty, wisdom, inventions, police protection, and so on, will be provided by consumer payment and because of free riders, they are perfectly at liberty to subsidize provision of such goods on their own, individually or through societies or foundations. By doing so, the donor will demonstrate that, to him, the expected psychic benefit from his subsidy is worth more than the money he pays.

It will be objected that potential donors will not donate if they are rankled by the spectacle of free riders who stubbornly refuse to donate for the benefits they receive. And, further, that consumers on the market will not be willing to purchase these goods if they know that free riders abound. If we wished to moralize here, we might respond that these persons might be well advised to attend to their own affairs without wallowing in envy at benefits received by others. But, in any case, if the rankling at the existence of free riders is strong enough, these persons are always free to boycott the miscreants, either by not trading with them or by general ostracism. [48]

The consumers or donors can also, if they wish, get around the free-rider problem by making contracts, either singly or in organized fashion, that will pay for the ""collective good,"" but only on condition that everyone else, including the potential free riders, pay as well. This form of contract would enable those willing to pay, in effect, to put the choice to the free riders: Either you join in paying or the service will not be provided. [49]

Transaction Costs

It has been objected that the ""transaction costs"" of identifying the free riders or channeling donations, or organizing boycotts or of making conditional contracts, are ""too high,"" and that therefore those who want these services are justified in turning to the government to force the free riders to pay.

There are several grave fallacies in the transaction costs argument for taxation. In the first place, it ignores the transaction costs of the government process itself. The implication is that government is a costless Mr. Fixit, levitating angelically above the fray and busily correcting ""market failures."" If private persons have difficulty in identifying free riders, will government be able to limit its taxation to free riders only? What of the external costs of the inevitable taxation beyond the free rider? And, as we have seen, since market and demonstrated preference through individual action is not available to government, there is no way that government can either identify the free riders or the ""negative free riders,"" or to discover how much benefit each person would derive from the subsidized supply and therefore how much each person should be taxed. There are also the inevitable grave inefficiencies in the political supply of goods and services and in the political process itself that need not be expounded here. At any rate, there is no reason to assume that the transaction costs of turning to government will be lower than those of private operation, and every reason to assume the opposite.

Second, another definitive rebuttal of the transaction-cost argument for government is the impossibility of comparing transaction costs, not simply of private and government action, but at any time and in any situation. For costs, like utilities, are subjective, and therefore nonmeasurable and noncomparable between persons. There is no such thing as social transaction costs or any social costs whatever. [50] Any government action will impose enormous psychic cost on the anarchist; any private action will do likewise for the dedicated totalitarian. How are we to compare them? If an entity does not and cannot exist, then it is senseless to take as one’s goal that it be minimized.

And third, even if transaction costs were measurable and comparable, we must ask: What is so terrible about transaction costs? On what basis are they considered the ultimate evil, so that their minimization must override all other considerations of choice, freedom, or justice? [51] After all, if minimizing these dread costs were truly the be-all and end-all, we could all pledge to obey one dictator, one Brezhnev or Idi Amin, in all things, and then everyone would have the assurance of knowing everyone else’s relevant value-scales. Other problems would abound, but at least transaction costs would be forced down to a minimum.

Coercion as ""Really"" Voluntary

An Austrian Perspectiv... Murray Rothbard Best Price: $$18.71 Buy New $$25.00 (as of 06:55 EST - Details )

A final fallback argument for the voluntariness of taxation and government asserts that every member of society wishes to pay for the collective goods but will do so only if everyone else pays. Therefore the seeming coercion of taxation is a fallacy, for everyone voluntarily pays in the serene knowledge that all beneficiaries are paying. In a kind of Hegelian leap, we are all voluntarily and cheerfully forcing ourselves to be free. [52]

This argument adds a heavy dose of mysticism to the other collective goods and external benefits arguments. For how do we know that everyone is voluntarily paying knowing that everyone else is doing so? There is no evidence, there is no social compact whatever to that effect. Is all that they pay supposed to be voluntary, or just some? Are they perhaps in mourning that their payments are not higher? And what of the anarchist and the pacifist and the tax rebel? Is their bitter opposition to taxation only a cloak for their cheerful acceptance? On what basis are we supposed to accept this curious doctrine?

There is, in short, no warrant whatever for Baumol’s contention that every individual prefers to be coerced into paying for a service rather than have none of it supplied at all. Moreover, this argument ignores the options as discussed above, of conditional contracts to finance the service voluntarily, or of voluntary boycotts of free riders. [53]

A popular argument holds that the fact of democracy establishes the voluntary nature of government. This idea need not detain us here long. As Herbert Spencer pointed out, democracy at best can only reduce the number of people being coerced; it does not eliminate coercion:

By no process can coercion be made equitable…. The rule of the many by the few we call tyranny: the rule of the few by the many is tyranny also…. ""You shall do as we will, and not as you will,"" is in either case the declaration; and if the hundred make it to the ninety-nine, instead of the ninety-nine to the hundred, it is only a fraction less immoral. Or two such parties, whichever fulfills this declaration necessarily breaks the law of equal freedom: the only difference being that by the one it is broken in the persons of the ninety-nine, whilst by the other it is broken in the persons of a hundred. And the merit of the democratic form of government consists solely in this, that it trespasses against the smallest number. [54]

Spencer concludes that ""the very existence of majorities and minorities is indicative of an immoral state."" For the ""enactment of public arrangements by vote,"" he points out, ""implies that the desires of some cannot be satisfied without sacrificing the desires of others … implies therefore, organic immorality."" [55]

Spencer goes on to point out that the doctrine that men may only be taxed by their own consent implies their right not to pay taxes, to ""ignore the State."" He then notes the reply of the statists that ""this consent is not a specific, but a general one, and that the citizen is understood to have assented to everything his representative may do, when he voted for him."" Spencer’s rebuttal to this democratic mythos is definitive:

But suppose he did not vote for him; and on the contrary did all in his power to get elected some one holding opposite views — what then? The reply will probably be that, by taking part in such an election, he tacitly agreed to abide by the decision of the majority. And how if he did not vote at all? Why then he cannot justly complain of any tax, seeing that he made no protest against its imposition. So, curiously enough, it seems that he gave his consent in whatever way he acted — whether he said yes, whether he said no, or whether he remained neuter! A rather awkward doctrine this. Here stands an unfortunate citizen who is asked if he will pay money for a certain preferred advantage; and whether he employs the only means of expressing his refusal or does not employ it, we are told that he practically agrees; if only the number of others who agree is greater than the number of those who dissent. And thus we are introduced to the novel principle that A’s consent to a thing is not determined by what A says, but by what B may happen to say! [56]

The Unanimity Principle

Sensing the problems of coercion by majority rule, social theorists from Calhoun (the ""concurrent majority"" theory) to Wicksell and Buchanan (the Unanimity Principle) have been trying to arrive at a polity free of this coercion. Although the search for a way out of coercion may be commendable, the seeming voluntariness of the Unanimity Principle suffers from two grave flaws. First, Wicksell and Buchanan apply the Unanimity Principle only to changes in the status quo, that is, to new acts of taxation and expenditure. But this simply ratifies existing property titles, and assumes that these existing property titles are just and must be maintained. In short, the ratification of changes from the zero point only by unanimous consent, virtually freezes that zero point permanently. But should it be? Suppose that, previous to the installation of the Unanimity Principle, a group of persons, either by their own violent conquest or through State action, had stolen and confiscated the property of another large group and called that property their own. The Unanimity Principle would then prohibit the victims from taking back their property, since such action would have to gain the consent of the robbers. In his classic article on the Unanimity Principle, Knut Wicksell first acknowledged this problem and then brusquely dismissed it. Thus Wicksell first concluded:

If there are within the existing property and income structure certain titles and privileges of doubtful legality or in open contradiction with modern concepts of law and equity, then society has both the right and the duty to revise the existing property structure. It would obviously be asking too much to expect such revision ever to be carried out if it were to be made dependent upon the agreement of the persons primarily involved. [57]

Conceived in Liberty Murray N. Rothbard Best Price: $$26.41 Buy New $$32.00 (as of 09:35 EST - Details )

But having admitted that, Wicksell then proceeded as if it had not been said, asserting that ""no [such] measure should be carried out unless it have the prior unanimous or at any rate overwhelming support of the whole people."" [58]

Second, the Unanimity Principle turns out to be something less than unanimous. Pacifists, tax rebels, and anarchists are apparently inconvenient to the goal of achieving unanimity in taxation, so the proponents speak of ""relative unanimity"" (Buchanan and Tullock), ""approximate unanimity"" (Wicksell), or ""virtual unanimity"" (the later Spencer). But these are all oxymorons, comparable to the phrase ""only a little pregnant."" Unanimity must mean consent by all and nothing less. [59] Anything less is necessarily coercive and not voluntary. [60]

J.B. Say on Taxation

In contrast to almost all other economists, J.B. Say was astonishingly clear-sighted about the true nature of the State and of taxation. In Say there was no vain, mystical quest for a truly voluntary State or for a benign quasi-business firm supplying services to the grateful public. Say saw clearly that government supplies services to itself and its favorites, that all government spending is therefore consumption spending by the politicians and the bureaucracy, and that that spending is extracted by coercion at the expense of the taxpaying public.

As Say points out: ""The government exacts from a taxpayer the payment of a given tax in the shape of money. To meet this demand, the taxpayer exchanges part of the products at his disposal for coin, which he pays to the tax-gatherers."" Eventually, the government spends the money on its own needs, and so ""in the end .. . this value is consumed; and then the portion of wealth, which passes from the hands of the taxpayer into those of the tax-gatherer, is destroyed and annihilated."" Were it not for taxes, the taxpayer would have spent his money on his own consumption. As it is, ""The state … enjoys the satisfaction resulting from the consumption."" [61]

Say goes on to attack the ""prevalent notion, that the values, paid by the community for the public service, return to it again …, that what government and its agents receive, is refunded again by their expenditures."" Say is indignant:

This is a gross fallacy; but one that has been productive of infinite mischief, inasmuch as it has been the pretext for a great deal of shameless waste and dilapidation. The value paid to government by the tax-payer is given without equivalent or return: it is expended by the government in the purchase of personal service, of objects of consumption. [62]

At this point Say revealingly quotes with approval Robert Hamilton’s likening of government to a robber in refuting the argument that taxation is harmless because the money is recirculated into the economy by the State. Hamilton compares this impudence to the ""forcible entry of a robber into a merchant’s house, who should take away his money, and tell him he did him no injury, for the money, or part of it, would be employed in purchasing the commodities he dealt in, upon which he would receive a profit."" Say then adds ""that the encouragement afforded by the public expenditure is precisely analogous."" [63]

Say bitterly goes on to denounce the ""false and dangerous conclusion"" of writers who claim that public consumption increases general wealth. ""If such principles were to be found only in books,"" Say went on, ""and had never crept into practice, one might suffer them without care or regret to swell the monstrous heap of printed absurdity."" But unfortunately they have been put into ""practice by the agents of public authority, who can enforce error and absurdity at point of the bayonet or mouth of the cannon."" [64] Once again, Say sees the uniqueness of government as the naked exercise of force and coercion.

Taxation, then, is the coercive imposition of a burden on members of the public for the benefit of consumption by the ruling class, by those in command of the government. Say writes:

Taxation is the transfer of a portion of the national products from the hands of individuals to those of the government, for the purpose of meeting the public consumption of expenditure…. It is virtually a burthen imposed upon individuals, either in a separate or corporate character, by the ruling power … for the purpose of supplying the consumption it may think proper to make at their expense; in short, an impost, in the literal sense. [65]

Thus Say is not impressed with the notion, properly ridiculed by Schumpeter, that all of society somehow voluntarily pay their taxes for the general benefit; instead, taxes are a burden coercively imposed upon society by the ""ruling power."" Neither is Say impressed if the taxes are voted by the legislature: For ""what avails it … that taxation is imposed by consent of the people or their representatives, if there exists in the state a power, that by its acts can leave the people no alternative but consent?""

Taxation, Say clearly pointed out, cripples rather than stimulates production, for taxation robs people of resources that they would rather use in a different way:

Taxation deprives the producer of a product, which he would otherwise have the option of deriving a personal gratification from, if consumed … or of turning to profit, if he preferred to devote it to any useful employment…. [T]herefore, the subtraction of a product must needs diminish, instead of augmenting, productive power. [66]

Say continues with a devastating critique of the argument that taxation is useful in stimulating people’s exertions and the development of industry. But first, industry is looted to satisfy the demands of the State, and hence productive capital is crippled:

Mere exertion cannot alone produce, there must be capital for it to work upon and capital is but an accumulation of the very products, that taxation takes from the subject: … in the second place, it is evident, that the values, which industry creates expressly to satisfy the demands of taxation, are no increase of wealth; for they are seized on and devoured by taxation.

As for the argument that taxes stimulate exertions:

To use the expedient of taxation as a stimulative to increased production, is to redouble the exertions of the community, for the sole purpose of multiplying its privations, rather than its enjoyments. For, if increased taxation be applied to the support of a complex, overgrown, and ostentatious internal administration, or of a superfluous and disproportionate military establishment, that may act as a drain of individual wealth, and of the flower of the national youth, and an aggressor upon the peace and happiness of domestic life, will not this be paying as dearly for a grievous public nuisance, as if it were a benefit of the first magnitude? [67]

Say is also properly critical of Ricardo for maintaining that the suppression of one branch of private industry by taxation will always be compensated by a diversion of capital to some other industry. Say rebuts that:

I answer, that whenever taxation diverts capital from one mode of employment to another, it annihilates the profits of all who are thrown out of employ by the change, and diminishes those of the rest of the community: for industry may be presumed to have chosen the most profitable channel. I will go further, and say, that a forcible diversion of the current of production annihilates many additional sources of profit to industry. Besides, it makes a vast difference to the public prosperity, whether the individual or the state be the customer…. [In the latter case] wealth and production decline in consequence, and prosperity vanishes, leaving behind the pressure of unremitting taxation. [68]

Economic Harmonies Frederic Bastiat Check Amazon for Pricing.

Say concludes with a scornful attack on the very idea that taxation and government spending add to national wealth:

It is a glaring absurdity to pretend that taxation contributes to national wealth, by engrossing part of the national produce, and enriches the nation by consuming part of its wealth. Indeed, it would be trifling with my reader’s time, to notice such a fallacy, did not most governments act upon this principle, and had not well-intentioned and scientific writers endeavored to support and establish it. [69]

Say’s basic recommendation on the tax question was, in consequence, simple, trenchant, and clear-cut: ""The best scheme of finance is, to spend as little as possible; and the best tax is always the lightest."" [70] In short, that government is best that spends and taxes least. But then, paraphrasing Thoreau’s and Benjamin R. Tucker’s logical extension of the similar conclusion of Jefferson: May we not say that that government is best that spends and taxes not at all? [71]

The Neutral Tax

Any quest for a nonredistributive neutral tax, such as free-market economists indulge in, must succeed in providing criteria for two basic questions about taxes: (a) how much taxes should be paid? and (b) who should pay them? The free market answers questions of ""who"" and ""how much"" very easily for its goods and services. But free-market economists have been singularly unsuccessful in providing either of these criteria for taxation. [72] Thus the answer of laissez-faire economists to the former question — that taxation should be limited strictly to protection or defense — founders, not only on the coercive nature of the payment, but also on the nonhomogeneity of the defense service. Defense, as we have seen above, is not a homogeneous lump but a good available in different quantities and qualities, in marginal units. Since the free market has been abandoned in this area, there is no way to arrive at any rational criteria for the optimal total amount or distribution of government defense, or of any other good or service.

Taxpayers and Tax-Consumers

It might be claimed that neutral taxation could be achieved in one way, if in no other: if the precise amounts that each individual paid in taxes were returned to him in government expenditure. Thus if A paid $$1,000 in taxes in a certain year, B paid $$500, and C $$300, and so on, then A would receive $$1,000, B $$500, and so on. It might be thought that such a taxation system would be at best absurd; for why construct an elaborate machinery that would simply take and then give back the same amounts to each person? Why then have taxation at all? But there is a grave flaw even in this attempt at a neutral tax: neglect of the bureaucratic handling charge.

For even if such a precisely equal tax-and-payment mechanism were constructed, there would have to be salaries paid to the bureaucracy administering the system (and to the politicians ruling the administrators). But these bureaucrats, then, would, in contrast to the rest of society, be net tax-receivers, and hence by at least the amount and dispensation of their salaries, the fiscal system could not be neutral to the market economy. For even if A, B, C, and so on, paid and received the equivalent amounts, bureaucrats B1, B2, B3, and so on, would be net tax-recipients, and in essence, would be paying no taxes at all. Their net incomes functioning in the bureaucracy will necessarily have to be subtracted from the net incomes of other members of society. And therefore the very existence and operation of government, as John C. Calhoun brilliantly pointed out, establishes at the very least a class struggle between the net tax-recipients and the net taxpayers. Calhoun’s analysis is worth quoting at length:

So deeply seated, indeed, is this tendency to conflict between the different interests or portions of the community that it would result from the action of the government itself, even though it were possible to find a community where the people were all of the same pursuits, placed in the same condition of life, and in every respect so situated as to be without inequality of condition or diversity of interests. The advantages of possessing the control of the powers of the government, and thereby of its honors and emoluments, are, of themselves, exclusive of all other considerations, ample to divide even such a community into two great hostile parties…. And what makes this evil remediless through the right of suffrage of itself … is the fact that, as far as the honors and emoluments of the government and its fiscal action are concerned, it is impossible to equalize it. The reason is obvious. Its honors and emoluments, however great, can fall to the lot of but a few, compared to the entire number of the community and the multitude who will seek to participate in them. But without this there is a reason which renders it impossible to equalize the action of the government so far as its fiscal operation extends….

Few, comparatively, as they are, the agents and employees of the government constitute that portion of the community who are the exclusive recipients of the proceeds of the taxes. Whatever amount is taken from the community in the form of taxes, if not lost, goes to them in the shape of expenditures or disbursements. The two — disbursement and taxation — constitute the fiscal action of the government. They are correlatives. What the one take from the community under the name of taxes is transferred to the portion of the community who are the recipients under that of disbursements. But as the recipients constitute only a portion of the community, it follows, taking the two parts of the fiscal process together, that its action must be unequal between the payers of the taxes and the recipients of their proceeds. Nor can it be otherwise; unless what is collected from each individual in the shape of taxes shall be returned to him in that of disbursements, which would make the process nugatory and absurd. Taxation may, indeed, be made equal, regarded separately from disbursement. Even this is no easy task; but the two united cannot possibly be made equal.

Walden and Other Writings Henry David Thoreau Best Price: $$1.39 Buy New $$11.99 (as of 02:20 EST - Details )

Such being the case, it must necessarily follow that some one portion of the community must pay in taxes more than it receives back in disbursements, while another receives in disbursements more than it pays in taxes. It is, then, manifest, taking the whole process together, that taxes must be, in effect, bounties to that portion of the community which receives more in disbursements than it pays in taxes, while to the other which pays in taxes more than it receives in disbursements they are taxes in reality — burdens instead of bounties. This consequence is unavoidable. It results from the nature of the process, by the taxes ever so equally laid….

Nor would it be less a bounty to the portion of the community which received back in disbursements more than it paid in taxes because received as salaries for official services, or payments to persons employed in executing the works required by the government, or furnishing it with its various supplies, or any other description of public employment — instead of being bestowed gratuitously. It is the disbursements which give additional and, usually, very profitable and honorable employments to the portion of the community where they are made … and hence, to the extent that the disbursements exceed the taxes, it may be fairly regarded as a bounty. The very reverse is the case in reference to the portion which pays in taxes more than it receives in disbursements. With them profitable employments are diminished to the same extent, and population and wealth correspondingly decreased.

The necessary result, then, of the unequal fiscal action of the government is to divide the community into two great classes: one consisting of those who, in reality, pay the taxes and, of course, bear exclusively the burden of supporting the government; and the other, of those who are the recipients of their proceeds through disbursements, and who are, in fact, supported by the government; or in fewer words, to divide it into taxpayers and tax-consumers.

But the effect of this is to place them in antagonistic relations in reference to the fiscal action of the government and the entire course of policy therewith connected. For the greater the taxes and disbursements, the greater the gain of the one and the loss of the other, and vice versa; and consequently, the more the policy of the government is calculated to increase taxes and disbursements, the more it will be favored by the one and opposed by the other.

The effect, then, of every increase is to enrich and strengthen the one, and impoverish and weaken the other. [73]

Thus if a bureaucrat receives an income of $$30,000 per year, and pays $$10,000 to the government in taxes, he is in reality not paying taxes at all. His tax payment is a bookkeeping fiction; in reality, he is simply a net tax-consumer to the tune of $$20,000.

Calhoun has thus shown that the very existence of taxation creates at least two conflicting classes: the ruling and the ruled, and that the ruling class are the net tax-consumers and the ruled the net taxpayers. The ruling classes comprise the full-time politicians and bureaucrats receiving government salaries, as well as the private sellers of goods and services to the governments or recipients of outright government subsidy. There is hence no way for government or for taxation to be neutral. Moreover, the greater the amount and degree of taxation/expenditures by government, the more important will be this unneutrality, this diversion of output and income from producers on the market to the State and the receivers of its largess. The greater the extent of government operation, therefore, the greater the class conflict in the society.

Proportional Taxation

Setting aside for a moment the problem of inherent nonneutrality stemming from the existence of taxation and expenditures, let us examine further the specific types or forms of taxes. Is there any form that might be called neutral to the market? Many economists have assumed that proportional taxation for each taxpayer (whether on incomes, property, or intangible ""sacrifice"") will leave the distribution of income or wealth the same as before, and therefore be neutral to the market. Thus to Edwin Cannan proportional property taxation serves as a ""sufficiently accurate standard"" of neutrality, so that ""the distribution of wealth between individuals"" is the same as ""it would be in the absence of State action."" [74] To Blum and Kalven, proportional sacrifice, presuming this intangible could be measured, has ""the virtue … that it remains neutral as to the relative distribution of satisfactions among taxpayers. Under it they are all equally ‘worse off’ after taxes."" [75]

At first blush, proportionality appears to leave market distribution the same. If, for example, a tax of 10 percent is levied on all incomes, is not the distribution of incomes left the same (setting aside the above insoluble problem of net tax-consumers)? It is true that if A earns $$30,000 a year, B earns $$20,000, and C earns $$10,000, and each pays 10 percent, the relative proportions of their income after taxes will remain the same as before ($$27,000, $$18,000, and $$9,000). But this question misconceives the very idea of the neutral tax. The point of a tax neutral to the market is not to leave the income distribution the same as if a tax had not been imposed. The point of a neutral tax is to affect the income ""distribution"" and all other aspects of the economy in the same way as if the tax were a free-market price. Only if a tax has the effect of a surrogate free-market price, only if, in a profound sense, it is part of the market, could it be neutral to that market. And it should be evident that no free-market price leaves income distribution the same. If every market price were proportional to the income of the purchaser, if David Rockefeller had to pay $$1,000,000 for a box of Wheaties, then there would be no point in having a higher income, and we would have an extraordinarily complex and unworkable form of compulsory equality of incomes.

The market does not form prices proportional to incomes; the market is characterized by uniform pricing, by a strong tendency toward the same price for the same good or service regardless of the income or personality of the buyer. [76]

Taxation and Benefits

If the market charges all consumers the same price for a particular service, it would seem that some form of equal (rather than equiproportional) taxation might be neutral to the market. One time-honored criterion attempting to arrive at such neutrality is the ""benefit"" principle: that each should pay taxes in accordance with the benefits he receives from the State. Those receiving the same benefits would pay the same amount of tax. There are many grave problems with this approach, however. First, in contrast to the marketplace, there is no way whatever for an external observer to gauge anyone’s benefits as derived from government. Since ""benefits"" are subjective, we cannot measure anyone’s benefit on the market either, but we can conclude, from a person’s voluntary purchase, that his (expected) benefit was greater than the value to him of the money given up in exchange. If I buy a newspaper for 25 cents, we can conclude that my expected benefit is greater than a quarter. But since taxes are compulsory and not voluntary, we can conclude nothing about the alleged benefits that are paid for with them. Suppose, in analogy, that I am forced at gunpoint to contribute 25 cents for a newspaper and that that newspaper is then forcibly hurled at my door. We would be able to conclude nothing about my alleged benefit from the newspaper. Not only might I be willing to pay no more than 5 cents for the paper, or even nothing on some days, I might positively detest the newspaper and would demand payment to accept it. From the fact of coercion there is no way of telling. Except that we can conclude that many people are not getting 25 cents’ worth from the paper or indeed are positively suffering from this coerced ""exchange."" Otherwise, why the need to exercise coercion? Which is all that we can conclude about the ""benefits"" of taxation. [77]

To Adam Smith, the benefit principle dictated proportional income taxation: ""The subjects of every state ought to contribute toward the support of government, as nearly as possible .. . in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under protection of the state."" [78]

Other writers have even used the benefit principle to justify progressive taxation. Yet there is no warrant whatever for assuming equi-, or even more than, proportional benefit from government. In one model the alleged benefit from government is to be simply deduced from one’s income, and it is claimed that this indicates a proportionately greater ""benefit from society."" But there are many flaws with this approach. For first, since everyone benefits from participating in society, the fact that A earns more than B must be attributed to individual differences in ability or productivity rather than to the benefits of society. And second, ""society"" — the pattern of voluntary exchanges of goods and services — is most emphatically not identical to the State, the coercive extractor of taxation.

Making Economic Sense Murray N. Rothbard Best Price: $$34.25 Buy New $$249.96 (as of 06:55 EST - Details )

If, indeed, we are to tax people in accordance with their benefit from government, we would have to tax all the net tax-consumers to the amount of their subsidies. We would have to tax 100 percent of the salaries of bureaucrats, of the incomes of welfare recipients and of defense contractors, and so on. We would then have our ideal model of the neutral tax where all recipients of government funds would systematically repay them to the taxpayers — an absurd if rather charming state of affairs. If we leave subsidies to concentrate only on supposedly common services such as police protection, then we would have to conclude that the poor benefit far more from police protection than the wealthy, since the wealthy could far better afford to pay for their own protection. We would therefore have to conclude, not that the rich benefit as much as or more than the poor, but far less. We would have to conclude that the poor and the infirm, far more in need of protection than the rich, should be taxed far more heavily than the rich and the able-bodied. [79]

Moreover, the market is misconstrued by the benefit principle. For on the market people do not pay in accordance with benefits received. The chess addict and the indifferent players pay the same price for the same chess set, and the opera enthusiast and the novice pay the same price for the same ticket. On the market, people tend to pay the same price for the same good, regardless of benefit. The poor and the weak might be the most eager for protection, but, in contrast to the benefit principle, they would not pay more for the same degree of protection on the market. And finally, everyone on the market enjoys a net benefit from exchange. If the entire benefit were taxed away (assuming this subjective concept could be measured), then this practice would totally violate market principles, where net benefits from exchange are always maintained.

The Equal Tax

If the market means having everyone pay the same price for the same service, perhaps then each person should pay the same tax, equal in absolute amount? The equal tax, or ""poll tax,"" is surely a far closer approximation to neutral taxation than any of the more common forms of taxation. It would indeed preserve the market principle of same price for same service. It would also be particularly appropriate for a democratic polity, where one person, one vote prevails, or for a regime that attempts to adhere to the principle of ""equality before the law."" [80]

But even the equal tax cannot be said to be neutral to the market. In the first place, it is impossible for observers outside the market, such as government, to gauge what service is ""equal"" to another service. Equality of service is not technological identity but similarity in the minds of the consumers. Only the free market, then, can determine different qualities or degrees of a service. Second, and even more important, there is no indication that for a particular taxpayer, the government is supplying a ""service"" at all. Since the tax is compulsory, it may well be that the ""service"" has zero or even negative value for individual taxpayers. Thus, a pacifist, philosophically opposed to any use of violence, would not consider a tax levied for his and others’ police protection to be a positive service; instead, he finds that he is being compelled, against his will, to pay for the provision of a ""service"" that he detests. In short, equal pricing on the market reflects demands by consumers who are voluntarily paying the price, who, in short, believe that they are gaining more from the good or service than they are giving up in exchange. But taxation is imposed on all people, regardless of whether they would be willing to pay such a price (the equal tax) voluntarily, or indeed whether they would voluntarily purchase any of this service at all.

The poll tax works particular hardship on those who would not ordinarily be participating in the market economy. Hence it (as well as the income tax) is payable in money and has been used as a fearsome whip to force natives in undeveloped countries out of subsistence or barter production and into working for money wages. Working for capitalists becomes the only way these natives can pay the tax. Thus Sir Percy Girouard, the British governor of Kenya, freely admitted, in the early twentieth century, that taxation was levied on the native to force him to go to work for British employers. The hut tax ""is the only method,"" opined Sir Percy, ""of compelling the native to leave his reserve for the purpose of seeking work. Only in this way can the cost of living be increased for the native."" [81] In the Congo Free State, the problem in that Belgian colony, as Parker Moon put it, was: ""Would the natives willingly go out into the jungle to collect rubber and tusks for the State?"" For, ""little appreciating the dignity of labor, the Congo negroes evinced a marked distaste for the task which their humane sovereign expected them to perform. Accordingly, another civilized innovation was introduced — taxes."" [82] Moon illuminates the relationship between taxation and forced labor in colonial countries:

In tropical Africa … the problem is how to make the natives work at all, for Europeans. Actual slavery is everywhere condemned, and vanishing…. Compulsory labor, once the fashion in Central Africa, is falling more and more under censure, though it is still utilized by governments when they need natives for railroad or road construction, or other public works….

Taxation is a favorite method of stimulating native industry. In many African colonies hut and poll taxes are imposed, ranging from fifty cents to several dollars per capita. The amount seems small enough, by our standards, but to the negro without money it is a large sum. He can earn it by working on a plantation or in a mine, for white employers, at wages that vary from five cents a day, or less, in Congo, Northern Rhodesia, and other regions, to six or seven cents in Kenya, perhaps twenty cents in the interior of Nigeria, and fifty cents or",lewrockwell.com,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Michael, now the official head of the Corleone ""family,"" answers by telling him how the other families will try to assassinate him — but that he also has his own plans.

When someone understands the forces arrayed against them and has a plan of action (Michael’s was to kill the other New York crime bosses before they killed him), they have a better chance of survival than they might if they were clueless about the enemy and even more clueless as to the best defense (and offense). However, many people in the same position often fail to recognize the problem and are even less likely to understand the solution.

Thus it is the situation regarding religious believers — and especially what we call conservative Christians, both Protestant and Roman Catholic. Each year governments in this country, from local bodies to the federal government, draw the noose tighter and tighter, no matter who or what party is in charge. Furthermore, the vaunted Constitutional protections literally mean nothing. The First Amendment, supposedly the ""religious freedom"" document, today is used mostly as a weapon to restrict the rights of Christians to speak freely in forums where they should be free to articulate their faith.

(I am not endorsing the ""school prayer"" policies per se, but neither do I believe they are unconstitutional, despite the U.S. Supreme Court’s many rulings on that issue. Indeed, I believe that the ""Incorporation Doctrines"" upon which the court has based its rulings, is in itself unconstitutional. Under the original Constitution, the High Court was never given the power to forbid prayer or any other religious exercises done by local government bodies. However, since the court has seized that power — with the Congress failing to do anything about it — there is not much the rest of us can do but live within these restrictions.)

At the current time, I believe that religious freedom in this country — and especially the freedom enjoyed by Christians — is in peril, and given the current legal trends, I do not think that the trends will be reversed. Thus, after pointing out where I think future attacks will be aimed, I also present a strategy for Christians to follow should they wish to preserve their liberties and give a road map they can follow as the government does what governments do best: destroy freedom.

In a recent essay, Lew Rockwell wrote that the prevailing civil religion in this country is equality, or to be more exact, egalitarianism. Thomas Jefferson’s words ""All men are created equal"" has been turned from the ideal of equality under law to equality of results, a very different — and pernicious — thing. By its very nature, Christianity is exclusionary, something that the modern equality police cannot tolerate and will always try to destroy. (In fact, Christianity also promotes a doctrine of equality, St. Paul writing that those who are Christians are equal in the sight of God. He was not, however, endorsing a doctrine of egalitarianism, despite what religious leftists claim.)

Given the Supreme Court’s recent decision to strike down state laws prohibiting homosexual activity, we can expect the equality theme to be increasingly applied to churches and religious organizations that operate under doctrines that prohibit homosexual sex (and all forms of sex outside marriage). Not surprisingly, the courts already have been moving in that direction. For example, several years ago, the federal courts forced Georgetown University, which is Catholic, to officially recognize a gay and lesbian student group on campus, despite the university’s contention that homosexuality is considered sinful in Catholic doctrine.

The court’s reasoning was that since (1) protecting homosexual rights constituted a ""compelling government interest,"" and (2) Georgetown received federal funding, therefore, the government had a legitimate interest in compelling the university to go against church doctrine. Indeed, other organizations that receive government funding for charitable work, such as the Salvation Army, have found themselves in the same quandary, the government trying to force them to hire homosexuals or others who fall outside the boundaries of what that organization believes the Bible requires of them.

It would seem obvious that if Christian organizations, such as colleges, wish to keep from having the government force them to do things that are against religious policies, then saying ""no"" to tax dollar funding is a proper first step (something that Hillsdale and Grove City colleges have done). However, one should keep in mind that even though many religious organizations refuse government money for just that reason, nearly all of them are tax exempt, something that Washington and the political classes depict as being equal to a subsidy. (The government lists tax exemptions as ""tax expenditures,"" a rather devious term that says more about the politicians than it does about the lost tax opportunities that tax exemptions present.)

The restrictions upon tax-exempt organizations — they are supposedly ordered to stay out of partisan politics — are enforced as one might expect: in a political manner. For example, the Internal Revenue Service basically shut down a church pastored by Randall Terry of Operation Rescue fame because he would preach sermons that called for people to vote against Bill Clinton. Bob Jones University, no stranger to right-wing politics, had its tax exemption yanked because of rules prohibiting interracial dating. The NAACP, on the other hand, clearly is aligned with the Democratic Party and in the 2000 presidential election ran an anti-Bush advertisement, basically claiming that he favored dragging black men to death behind pickup trucks. Of course, there was no move to strip the NAACP of its tax-exempt status.

At the present time, the IRS has not moved against conservative churches for their refusal to ordain women and practicing homosexuals to the pastorate or priesthood. While a few people have filed suit against the Roman Catholic Church for sex discrimination, they have been unsuccessful in their efforts to have the IRS remove the church’s tax exemption. However, as the civic religion of equality continues to grow, spreading its tentacles in nearly every institution in this country, I predict it will not be long until the IRS begins to meddle directly in church doctrine by threatening to withdraw tax-exempt status unless they rewrite their policies on ordination and membership.

While detractors can say they oppose conservative Christians because of the right-wing politics that some of them practice, in truth the base of these attacks is much deeper, I believe. When talk show host Phil Donahue was in his glory about 20 years ago, nearly every Christian guest on his show was met by the same question, always asked in a way that made one believe Donahue was going to pop a blood vessel: ""You mean to tell me that if a person doesn’t believe in Jesus, then you say they are going to Hell?!?"" Being that people are free (or should be free) to hold religious beliefs, and being that Donahue’s guests did not write the Bible, it does not take much thought to realize that Donahue was not challenging church doctrine as much as trying to personally attack a Christian, and the public hostility towards Christians has grown exponentially since Donahue’s heyday.

In an earlier article on this subject, I noted that researchers have found that the single most telling predictor of a person’s political preferences is that individual’s attitude towards conservative Christians. Those who intensely hate people in that religious camp almost always are Democrats. Now, as I pointed out, that does not make the Republicans the Party Of God (GOP spelled backwards), but I have no doubts that future Democratic presidents are going to try to destroy some churches with the tax code. (Of course, once the Republicans take power, they are too gutless to reverse the administrative decisions of their Democratic predecessors, and especially on religious issues, as they do not wish to be seen as pandering to the ""religious right."")

The attacks do not involve just tax policies. Within the past few years, a number of state universities (and a few private ones like Harvard) — the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill being one of the worst offenders — have threatened Christian student organizations with ""de-recognition"" because they elect only confessing Christians as their officers. The university administrators enforcing these policies claim that ""equality"" trumps ""rights of association,"" and being that most civil rights laws are based upon the same belief, one does not need to engage in mental gymnastics to see where things are headed. Lew Rockwell’s theme proves to be a strong predictor of leftist behavior.

When the government begins to strip conservative churches of their tax-exempt status for their refusal to ordain women and homosexuals, I believe it will then only be a matter of time before the civil complaints become criminalized. For now, discrimination cases are decided only in the civil courts, but should form hold true there as it has in other areas of federal law, U.S. attorneys will look to turning these things into criminal cases.

While some readers may think I am stretching things, please remember that many of the so-called white collar crimes in which people have gone to prison in recent years are nothing more than the criminalization of technical regulatory violations, many of which were ignored in the past. At the same time, many environmental ""crimes"" which have resulted in prison terms also have evolved from what once would only have been considered civil cases.

Thus, I think that there is a real possibility that individuals in churches who are in decision-making positions are likely to find themselves in the dock on charges of ""criminal"" discrimination. Please remember that until the prosecution of Michael Milken, no one ever had faced criminal charges for ""parking"" stocks. Martha Stewart faces criminal prosecution in part because she publicly declared herself to be ""not guilty"" of ""insider trading,"" which the government claims is ""securities fraud."" Such actions by federal prosecutors that even 20 years ago would have seen farfetched, now have become commonplace — and very popular with the so-called ""watchdogs"" of the press. Being that the absolute hatred mainstream journalists have towards conservative Christians dwarfs their hatred of capitalism, one can expect to see members of the press being the cheerleaders as the First Amendment protections for religious freedom are destroyed by the state.

As the United States becomes more and more militantly secular, it seems clear that the state will flex its muscles against Christian organizations even more so than is being done currently. The issue is not ""if,"" but ""when."" This situation, then, seems to demand the question: ""What do we do?"" I try to answer that question next.

I think that the current political strategy by conservative Christians truly is as bad as the strategies of the secularists against which they are fighting. The belief that if Christians can ""elect good people,"" then the government won’t devise and enforce anti-Christian policies has proven to be wrong; since 1976, all five U.S. presidents have openly declared themselves to be ""Christians,"" yet these anti-religious policies by the central government have metastasized.

Furthermore, believing (and practicing) Christians have always been in the minority in the USA, and today in the media age, they are a despised minority. The idea that Christians can elect enough ""good people"" to public office to stem this tide is ludicrous at best and delusional at worst.

Instead of joining the secular culture and politicizing everything, I believe that Christians who wish to preserve and expand religious freedom should go down a different path than what is currently being followed. That may seem to be counterintuitive, as most religious conservatives believe that it is imperative that people who share their views hold political power.

First, while decrying the ""culture wars,"" conservative Christians seem to forget that the real cultural rot has been the politicizing of nearly every aspect of life. Second, I hold that believers can be much better examples of ""salt and light"" by operating outside the coercive elements of the state.

This does not mean I think Christians should not be involved at all in politics or hold government office. Rather, I believe that Christians (such as Ron Paul) who engage in these activities should be the picture of restraint when it comes to using political power. (Instead, we have the religious right admiring John Ashcroft, a confessing Christian who has openly abused the powers of his office as U.S. Attorney General.)

Furthermore, there is nothing wrong in presenting one’s case to political authorities. St. Paul appealed to Caesar in an attempt to legalize and legitimize the practice of Christianity in the Roman Empire. However, it is one thing to appeal to Caesar and quite another to try to be Caesar himself. Just as Romans worshipped their emperor as a god, so do many American Christians find themselves immersed in a civil religion of ""God and Country"" in which the United States and Christianity are intertwined in a most unholy alliance in a near-worship of the welfare-warfare state.

The war in Iraq is only the latest rendition of this civil religion. In a recent column, Charles Colson praised the American soldiers profusely, claiming that large numbers of them are Christians who are living out their faith. (One member of our church whose son is serving in Iraq tells us that the son’s main concern is the lack of any Christian fellowship within the U.S. Army and the general amorality of the troops. If these troops really are ""God’s Army,"" as so many Christian conservatives are claiming, then maybe someone needs to redefine the term.)

Christians who wish to preserve their religious freedom should realize that the present conservative strategy not only is not working, but that it truly has been disastrous. It seems that every few weeks, we see a new line drawn in the sand; the government steps over it, and then a new line is drawn. Should Christians continue with this losing political strategy, it will only make it that much easier for liberals to fight the battle they have been winning for more than a century.

Most conservative Christians abhor libertarianism because they see it as promoting a permissive lifestyle from abortion to taking drugs. Yet, what they fail to understand is that the restrictive, prohibition-oriented state that they are trying to create (and also preserve) is much more likely to take away all liberties than a state that gives people permission to live as they wish (within the boundaries of not doing harm to others and engaging in peaceful exchange).

For example, one way for a politician to receive applause at a meeting of politically active conservative Christians is to endorse the war on drugs. Now, there have been few worse social failures than the war on drugs, as it is responsible for the loss of much liberty and the expansion of intrusive powers by the police. Furthermore, drug laws do little more than serve to lock up people in prison; they certainly do not do anything to stem the tide of illicit drug use.

Nor is it written in stone that libertarians must support the current legal climate with regard to abortion. After all, Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton were not decisions that the U.S. Supreme Court came to through libertarian reasoning; instead, the court decided those cases in its efforts to further destroy the federalist compact that was part and parcel to the original Constitution. There are ways to deal with this issue, as have been expressed on this website many times.

My point simply is this: the political strategy that conservative Christians have embraced for more than two decades not only has been ineffective, but also downright harmful. The law-and-order policies have meant this country imprisons more people than any other country, with the vast majority of prisoners being incarcerated for non-violent offenses. (In fact, prisons are under pressure to parole violent offenders in order to make room for the non-violent prisoners being convicted under the expanded new rules and laws that constantly come from Congress and state legislatures.)

I believe we can do better, and I think that the best way to preserve religious freedom is to be willing to preserve freedoms for people whose lifestyles and beliefs often seem antithetical to Christianity. Instead of trying to use the police powers of the state to arrest homosexuals, Christians should be willing to protect the freedoms of individuals who engage in peaceful conduct on their own property that all parties have freely agreed to do — even if that conduct may seem to be disgusting to many people. By protecting private property rights, Christians will help protect their own freedoms to worship.

Alas, I fear that most Christian conservatives want to employ the state to invade the property of others — not realizing that those same powers will later be employed against them. For example, when Hitler first took power in Germany, many religious conservatives of that era approved of many things he was doing. (Hitler’s totalitarian government gave us the first statewide anti-tobacco campaign, something that seems to be lost upon our present-day tobacco prohibitionists.)

Conservative Christians, I believe, will come to regret their foray into coercive politics, as though the modern American state can even be used to promote and protect liberty — or even civilization, for that matter. Unfortunately, when they come to regret giving the state increasing powers, that epiphany will come long after the state has used those same political powers to disenfranchise Christians.

In the wake of Durham County District Attorney Michael Nifong’s dropping of rape charges against Collin Finnerty, David Evans, and Reade Seligmann — and keeping the kidnapping and sexual assault charges alive — I believe I need to make some statements about the case where it presently stands, and what to expect in the future.

First, and most important, Nifong dropped the charges not because he had ""new evidence,"" but because the defense found out he had been illegally hiding ""old evidence."" Nifong had the same information in April that the defense finally received in December, and when it was made public, then the rogue prosecutor immediately claimed that the ""victim"" now could not remember some of the details of the ""rape."" Thus, he said he believed he no longer could ""prove"" rape, so he dropped those charges.

Second, his holding onto the kidnapping and sexual assault charges are also part of the Big Lie he has chosen to promote. Despite the claims by his supporters, like Irvin Joyner, the law professor at North Carolina Central University, that these charges do not require DNA and other such aspects of evidence, the same barriers remain.

First, he has to be able to place Finnerty, Seligmann, and Evans all in the bathroom alone with her at the same time. The evidence clearly does not point to that. Second, as for sexual assault, DNA still will play a role, as not one spec of DNA from the young men was ever found on her, despite the extensive ""crime scene"" investigation that police and hospital personnel carried out.

Second, the only person making the claim is the accuser herself, Crystal Gail Mangum. She has told a number of very different stories that have changed with each set of questions from investigators who surely from the start knew better than to believe her. This woman is not exactly a credible accuser, having lied to police about her sexual habits prior to the fateful party.

Unfortunately, not everyone is willing to admit the obvious. Take Sports Illustrated writer Lester Munson, who in the wake of the latest news wrote:

They (the defendants) still face some serious charges. There is little doubt that something unsavory happened at the party on March 13. After the dismissal of the rape charges, it will be easier for the accused players to attempt to settle everything with a guilty plea on lesser charges.

Here is a writer who still wants to believe that these ""privileged, white"" athletes at least attacked the woman even though the other evidence that has come about since last spring makes such an event so unlikely as to be impossible. He does not seem to understand that there is no basis for charges, other than Nifong’s desire to win an election and for the local black community of Durham, as well as a sizeable chunk of the Duke faculty to be able to exercise their prejudices.

However, when one examines the performances of members of the so-called mainstream media (or MSM) such as the New York Times, Washington Post, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated, and the broadcast outlets, one finds that these were the organizations that from the start were the engines publicizing the false charges — and desperately trying to give them credibility. Even now, we see someone from the MSM trying to salvage something out of it.

I predict that this sorry case never will make it to trial, no matter what Munson and his other MSM colleagues believe. Nifong is not going to risk having his entire case rest upon a single witness who has lied from the first moment, and who never had real credibility. He will find a way to drop the other charges — and it will not occur because the players plead to misdemeanors.

The unfortunate thing is that people are going to have the impression that Nifong is a rogue prosecutor whose actions are unlike those of other prosecutors. I disagree, and disagree heartily. Nifong is a product of the mentality that governs the prosecutorial process in the United States today: Just win, and win at all costs.

224115,"It must be a condition of employment that a journalist who writes about the current recession include in his article the statement, consumption makes up more than two-thirds of the economy or consumption spending accounts for 70 percent of GDP. This seemingly simple, factual statement, however, is nearly always intended to carry some explanatory weight, and on occasion the writer spells out this explanation by adding a statement such as, unless consumers begin to open their wallets and spend more, recovery from the current recession will be impossible.

At first glance, this journalistic commonplace appears to make sense. Anyone can understand that, say, a store at the mall will not hire additional employees unless its sales increase enough to justify the additional expense. Hence, would-be employees will remain unemployed; they will purchase fewer consumption goods than they would have purchased if they had jobs; and therefore the stores will not hire more workers; and so forth. The circle of a theory of income and employment seems to be closed, and thus an explanation provided for the lingering recession: consumers are not spending enough.

One does not need a Ph.D. in economics, however, to discover that something must be wrong with this way of thinking about prosperity and recession. Checking the national economic accounts produced by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis (Table l.l.6), one finds, for example, that the most recent quarterly peak in real personal consumption expenditure occurred in the fourth quarter of 2007. This spending ($$9,244 billion at an annual rate) equaled 69.2 percent of contemporary GDP ($$13,364 billion at an annual rate) — where the data are expressed in dollars of 2005 purchasing power. Real GDP did not fall significantly until the third quarter of 2008. When it reached its trough in the second quarter of 2009, it had fallen to $$12,810 billion, down about 4 percent. At that time, real personal consumption spending was $$9,117 billion, down only 1.4 percent, and equal to about 71 percent of GDP. Thus, as usual over the course of a boom and bust, consumption spending varied proportionately less than GDP as a whole.

As every student of the business cycle learns early on, the most variable part of aggregate expenditure is private investment. When real gross private domestic investment peaked, in the first quarter of 2006, it was $$2,265 billion, or 17.5 percent of GDP. When it hit bottom in the second quarter of 2009, it had fallen by 36 percent to $$1,453 billion, or 11.3 percent of GDP. (Deducting investment expenditures aimed at compensating for depreciation of the private capital stock [Table 1.7.6], we find that real net private investment — the part that contributes to economic growth — in the most recent quarter was only one-third as great as it was at its peak in early 2006.) The ups and downs of the business cycle are obviously driven not by consumption spending, but by investment spending.

In the second quarter of 2010, real personal consumption was $$9,270 billion, or slightly above its previous peak, at an all-time high. If stimulating consumption spending were the key to an economic revival, we would have achieved one already. And if we accepted real GDP as an adequate index of the economy’s health, we might affirm that conclusion, given that in the most recent quarter, real GDP was only 1.3 percent below its previous peak. With the official unemployment rate stuck near 10 percent and millions of people having left the labor force or having settled for part-time work, however, that conclusion is hard to swallow.

ANNOUNCER: This is the Lew Rockwell Show.

ROCKWELL: We’re very lucky today to have Dr. Tom Woods. Tom is senior fellow in American history at the Mises Institute. He’s a columnist at LewRockwell.com. And if you haven’t read his past columns, it’s one of the archives that really pays taking a look at. He’s a very prolific guy not only in columns but he’s the author of eight books, and his most recent one is called Who Killed the Constitution?: The Fate of American Liberty from World War I to George W. Bush. He wrote this with Professor Kevin Gutzman, who teaches at Western Connecticut State University.

similar feeling but I’ve always been somewhat of a Constitution skeptic in the sense that I think the Federalists, as Murray Rothbard put it, staged a coup in Philadelphia over the far more Libertarian Articles of Confederation. Hans Hoppe points out that every single adoption of a constitution in world history, so far as he can tell, represents a step up in government power and centralization. So why should we care about the Constitution, if it, indeed, was killed?

WOODS: Right. It’s a good question. It may deserve to be buried — (laughing).

Well, my own thinking on the subject is that I have no superstitious reverence for the Constitution. The reason that I like to study it though is that I am persuaded by what Hans says that, of course, it’s utopian to think that if you have a government, and you have a document that’s supposed to restrain that government but that government interprets that document, what on earth do you think is going to happen? Do you think it’s going to remain limited to the powers in that constitution? What possible incentive would it have for doing that? To the contrary, what should we expect to happen? We should expect it to find every loophole and stretch it to the limit. We should expect it to educate the population to believe that this is a wonderful feature of the society. I mean, everything that has come to pass is almost implied in the initial premise if you just work it all out. So, no, it’s not that I have some reverence for the Constitution.

a speech. How does that happen? That’s the phenomenon we want to observe.

And, by the way, Lew, that’s actually the argument that most turned me away from being a sort of traditional, old-fashioned constitutionalist, a constitutionalist-type conservative and into a more radical Libertarian, were precisely these arguments that governments are not restrained by pieces of paper. They cannot possibly be. And once you realize that, then that just opens up a panorama of alternatives that you never considered before.

ROCKWELL: Although, I guess, as Murray also pointed out, that it’s a great thing to be able to use the Constitution if you can, rhetorically, to show that the federal government, the Supreme Court, the Congress, especially the presidency is violating what it claims to be bound by and what they would claim as the founding organic document of the American state. Who has been the worst offender if we look at the three branches of government? Who, in terms of ripping up the original interpretation and using it as a grant of power, as you say? Is the main problem the Supreme Court? Is it the presidency? Is it the Congress?

I might just mention a very funny line by Joe Sobran, who was saying he was, “reconsidering the parliamentary system; maybe it was better than the American system.” And somebody said, well, that’s ridiculous because, of course, there’s no written constitution in England and, therefore, the parliament can just, by majority vote, in effect, amend the Constitution.” And Sobran said, “You mean versus here where it takes the majority vote of five to four to amend the Constitution”?

(LAUGHTER)

WOODS: That’s right.

contempt for this document, it helps to undermine the legitimacy of the regime. And I think that’s a worthy aim.

But in terms of who’s most responsible, what I can say is that, in our book, we don’t give the usual sort of right-wing lament that, you know, it’s just a runaway Supreme Court, and where do these crazy liberal judges come from. Well, you know, look, these crazy liberal judges, so called — and they’re not all liberals who are responsible for this, by the way — but given that they’re nominated by presidents and approved by Congress, it seems unlikely that it’s just some mystery that, all of a sudden, for heaven’s sake, how do we have these crazy justices. This sort of passing the buck, we don’t take lightly.

So instead, we’re sort of inclined to say it’s a three-way tie. I mean, the Supreme Court has been responsible for all kinds of outrages as they have rubber-stamped what the federal government has been doing. But, you know, the executive branch has been a complete disaster as well. And here’s an area where, a lot of times when you deal with the various chapters of the Federalist Society, which is the confederation of conservative and/or Libertarian law school groups, a lot, but not all of the students who are attracted to that seem to have a kind of, in my view, misplaced sympathy for the executive branch. They’ll let the executive branch get away with a lot. And I don’t want to say that that’s true or false. I’ve spoken at a lot of Federalist Society chapters and had much success there.

But the executive branch has been engaged in a lot of unilateral activity that is not authorized by the Constitution, by means of executive orders, for example. You talk about, just as almost a trivial case but typical, is in the early 1940s, you had Franklin Roosevelt, who, by executive order, declared that from now on the top income tax rate would be 100% for incomes above $$25,000 — 100%. And Congress finally intervened and overruled him and said that that would undermine the war effort if we were taking everybody’s money over $$25,000. “People wouldn’t work hard enough for the war machine, so we can’t do that, Mr. President.” So, thank heavens, we had the Congress to step in. But that type of thing has gone on just — certainly, all through the 20th century. There was a lot of it under Lincoln. But, unilateral exercise of power by the executive, and then the Congress retroactively approves a lot of these, in effect, legislative acts by the president. So there are cases like that.

Constitution. I mean, you know, your sort of left-wing high-school teacher doesn’t like George W. Bush but will teach you to admire Harry Truman. Well, Truman had exactly the same view of the president’s war powers that George W. Bush has. He thought he could seize the steel mills. He would not rule out the possibility of seizing the newspapers and the radio stations. You just go down the line. You had an assistant attorney general — I was pointing this out at a rally this weekend — who, when he was confronted in federal court and asked, “If the president appointed a subordinate to take you into custody and execute you in the morning, do you really believe you have no power to enjoin this”? And the assistant general under Truman replied, “I’ll have to think that one over.” I mean, that’s the sort of thing we would expect under George W. Bush, but it’s been true all though the 20th century with all the so-called great presidents. So the executive branch is at least as responsible for what we’ve seen.

And, of course, the Congress seems to believe that if it has a majority vote in the Congress, there is no constitutional impediment to taking over the entire health care system; just pretty much anything. In fact, in the 1990s, when Bill Clinton’s solicitor general was asked, “Can you come up with one area of American life that you believe the federal government would have absolutely no constitutional authority to intervene,” he just stood there stupefied and he had absolutely no answer.

So it seems like it’s really been a kind of collusion of the three branches, which is what Jefferson feared. Thomas Jefferson was not one of these fans — or I would say Jefferson was of the belief that mere division of power into three branches doesn’t guarantee a thing. What does that guarantee? It just means that they’ll just have to work together to go after the liberties of the people. Well, big deal. That’s exactly what they would do and that’s what they have done.

ROCKWELL: You know, it’s funny that Jefferson was the one significant founding father not to be involved in the war. He wasn’t a general. He wasn’t a colonel. Sometimes there seems to be something unfortunate about putting men into positions of military command and for the rest of their lives they feel everybody else should continue to obey them. They make very unfortunate presidents.

have the power to restraint government or is it just entirely a dead letter as — Bush supposedly said that it was a dead letter. Is it, in fact, a dead letter or is there any hope for those of us who would welcome any kind of a tool to try to beat back the totalitarian state that seems to be growing in this country.

WOODS: Right. Well, of course, Bush’s remark about the Constitution involved language that would make this not a family friendly podcast, so that was good of you to say that he simply called it a dead letter — (laughing).

Well, I think at this point, I mean, if they can get away with what they’re doing, what they’ve been doing for basically a hundred years that — I mean, if this isn’t a dead letter, then nothing is a dead letter. But as I say, it still can serve the purpose of showing the American people that this is obviously what, for example, presidential war powers were intended to be. That’s not even controversial.

When Mitt Romney — I can’t even believe I would waste my time mentioning this guy’s name. But when Mitt Romney said in that Republican debate over the question of whether he could deploy troops to Iran on his own authority that he would consult his lawyers, you know, my immediate thought was, if you even think this subject is debatable, then you’re unqualified for the office. It is not debatable. And there aren’t — you know, a lot of times people will say, well, you never know what the Constitution was supposed to mean and this and that. That’s a debate for another day. But when it comes to something like war powers, that is clearly a case where all the evidence is on one side. All the evidence is on one side. There is basically nothing for presidential unilateralists to point to in the Constitution, the ratifying conventions, American history, early court decisions; there’s nothing they can point to. And yet, today, you know, we think it’s not unusual at all for the president to do as he wishes.

And President Bush responded that he will interpret that clause as being “advisory” in nature. So you know — (laughing) — “I’ll take that under advisement, but if I want to do what I want to do, I’m just going to go ahead with it.

So it does seem to me to be a dead letter. But as I say, it can be a useful wake-up call for a lot of people.

And, you know, when you look at some of the things that the Supreme Court has let the federal government get away with — I mean, the favorite sort of classic example showing how FDR transformed the courts, the Wickard v. Filburn case, 1942, when you had a farmer who was growing wheat for his own use on his own land that he consumed or fed to his livestock, and the federal government was arguing they could regulate that because that was interstate commerce. And he couldn’t see how consuming his own produce on his own land was interstate commerce. And the answer was that because he hadn’t acquired that wheat from another state and he might have, then he had indirectly influenced interstate commerce and, therefore, they could regulate it. I mean, that has been the sort of touchstone of how you interpret that Commerce Clause ever since.

And it was only in the 1990s, the mid ’90s, that in a very, very weak way — that was repeated only one other time in the Morrison case — but in the Lopez case in the mid ’90s, it was too much even for the Supreme Court when the federal government said, we have the right to regulate guns in school zones — even though 40 states were already doing that — on the grounds that if students fear there might be guns in the area, at their school, they won’t be able to concentrate as well, and if they can’t concentrate so much, they won’t be as educated; if they’re not as educated, they won’t be as productive, and if they’re not as productive, they won’t produce as much in the way of goods for interstate commerce so, therefore, we can regulate them. That was a little bit much even for the normally indulgent Supreme Court.

ROCKWELL: Well, Tom, thanks so much.

And I want to highly recommend this book, Who Killed the Constitution? Like anything Tom Woods has written, this book is fun to read, easy to read, eloquent. You’ll learn a lot in a very — a way involving no pain. It’ll tell you about the very unfortunate history of the Constitution in this country. It will help stimulate you to want to do something about it and about the over-weaning power of the government.

And, Tom, I hope you’ll come back and talk to us on two other occasions about your book, The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History, which was on The News York Times best-seller list for a long time, as well as my favorite book of yours, The Church and the Market.

So, Tom, thanks very much, and great to have you.

WOODS: I look forward to that. Thank you.

460039,"The CIA’s assassination plan, which it chose to keep secret from Congress, brings to mind Operation Condor, a similar plan run by DINA, which was Chile’s counterpart to the CIA under the dictatorial regime of military strongman Augusto Pinochet.

After Pinochet took power in a coup, his agents proceeded to round up communists and other opponents to his regime and torture, sexually abuse, rape, indefinitely incarcerate, and kill them, without any trials or due process of law. It was during that time, in fact, that the CIA, which supported Pinochet, played a role, as yet undetermined, in the murder of a young American journalist named Charles Horman.

Pinochet knew that his war on communism, however, could not be limited to Chile, given that communists were located all over the world. Thus, Chile, along with other South American right-wing regimes, established Operation Condor, a secret program of assassination, torture, and political repression. According to Wikipedia, files discovered in 1992 in Paraguay revealed that Operation Condor succeeded in murdering 50,000 people, disappearing another 30,000, and incarcerating 400,000.

One day in 1976, however, Operation Condor hit a stumbling block here in the United States. As part of its global war on communism, it took out Chilean citizen Orlando Letelier with a car bomb that succeeded in killing not only him but also his American assistant, Ronni Moffitt. The killing took place on the streets of Washington, D.C.

What’s wrong with that, you ask? Weren’t Chile and the other members of Operation Condor involved in a major war? Didn’t they have the right to kill the enemy, wherever the enemy happened to be found? Wasn’t the entire world, including the United States, a battlefield in the global war on communism?

After all, what was different about the Letelier assassination and the CIA’s firing of a missile into a car in 2002 in Yemen that was carrying suspected terrorists, including one who was an American citizen? Didn’t the car in Yemen contain people who the CIA was sure were terrorists or terrorist sympathizers? Didn’t the car in Washington contain people that DINA was sure were communists or communist sympathizers, one of whom was a Chilean citizen?

There were some Americans who didn’t feel that Operation Condor should be permitted to extend its global war on communism to the United States. Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffitt were murder victims, they argued. The wartime analogy was hogwash, they said. Letelier, after all, was really just a former member of the cabinet in Chile’s Salvador Allende regime, which had been ousted in the Pinochet coup, who had continued his political battle against Pinochet’s dictatorship in the United States.

The Operation Condor agents who killed Letelier and Moffitt were ultimately indicted for murder in a U.S. District Court in Washington.

As it turned out, the DINA agent who orchestrated the murder of Letelier and Moffitt was a man named Michael Townley, who also — surprise, surprise — had worked for the CIA. Owing to public pressure, Townley was extradited to the United States to stand trial. The feds ultimately offered him a plea bargain that required him to testify against his underlings and that enabled him to live the rest of his life here in the United States under the federal witness protection program.

Assuming the CIA is telling the truth in its claim that it never carried out its assassination program, did the CIA factor in the Letelier-Moffitt case in deciding not to carry through with its assassination program? Perhaps. After all, if CIA assassins were to be arrested in a foreign country and indicted for murder, how would they be able to distinguish what they did from what Operation Condor did to Letelier and Moffitt?

462565,"November started out nice. I had a birthday, turned 26, big party with the Fam, lots of fun. Little did I know that things would go downhill fast.

The last day of October marked the last day that my car was legal, I had to re-register it. This is just another way that the state makes you pay more for doing well economically. I have a model 2001 Toyota, not the newest but not bad, and the state “assessment fee” is $$150, but then they add insult to injury by tacking on a “registration fee” of $$26.50. Not to mention the state mandated safety check where my two rear tires and my windshield (which has developed a crack) didn’t pass. Add on another $$200 to my state mandated tab. Now I’m fuming because I’ve been running all around town all day, so you can imagine my dismay/anger when I see the line of 10 people waiting in front of me at the DMV. 10 people in front of you at the restaurant, 20 to 30 min; 10 people in front of you at the grocery store, 15 to 20 min; 10 people in front of you at the DMV, an eternity. Needless to say having my son create a dirty diaper right before I saw someone didn’t help.

Why do we put up with this? Shouldn’t I be able to decide when my tires are too bald to drive on, shouldn’t I be able to decide when the crack in my windshield impairs my vision and becomes dangerous? And what exactly is an “assessment fee”? It’s the first week in Nov. and I’m already out $$400 bucks that could have gone to Christmas. Damn the man.

Private enterprise is far more efficient than the state, and I’m not just talking about lines here. I work in a FDA regulated industry. It didn’t used to be regulated but that’s another story. Years ago our company decided that in order to legitimize our new industry a standard would have to be developed and set. So rather than reinvent the wheel we asked Underwriters Laboratories to come and audit our company and search for quality related issues. They have been doing this for years.

They are prompt in the conduct of the audit.

They call and make appointments.

They send the same auditor out each time so the audits are more efficient and we don’t always have to start over.

They finish the audits in 1 or 2 days depending upon the complexity of the audit.

They focus on quality processes not paperwork, they focus on the customer not the regulations.

Yesterday the FDA showed up for a surprise inspection. This always makes me nervous, not that I am guilty of any wrong doing; I always try to comply with the regulations, but the regulations can and have in the past been interpreted in contrary ways depending upon the auditor. This is the 3rd time they have inspected our firm and the 3rd team of inspectors, so that’s 3 different interpretations of the same confusing regulatory language.

Each time they take 2 days reading over our paperwork trying to understand what it is that we do. They then spend a week or more asking questions and interrogating me and my staff. All the while they have a smug attitude and a superior nose about them. Our first inspection the inspector casually mentioned that if she wanted to she could fine us millions of dollars to put us out of business without having to actually shut us down, this was before she had even looked at our process or our paperwork. We gave her a nickname, Wilbur, and made fun of her the entire time she was there without her knowing. Yeah, I know it’s childish and petty, but you do what you can to enact some sort of revenge.

My wife who is pretty tolerating by nature has turned to calling them fascists. She was in the office lobby when the recent Gestapo goosestepped in and announced that they would like to see if our papers were in order. After letting me know that they were here she asked them if they had made an appointment.

“No, We don’t have to.”

At that point my wife clicked her feet together did a curt bow and marched away mumbling to herself.

The difference between private enterprise and the state is unbelievable.

These inspectors will be here for a week or more. Partially because they have to start from scratch and partially because they don’t have to be fast.

They focus on paperwork, not quality. Our company has a joke: “We could take our devices out back and wash them with the garden hose as long as the hose is validated.”

Since the FDA has begun regulating us they have increased our expenses and done nothing to improve the quality of our product. This didn’t shock me, I expected it, but my wife was finally convinced of the uselessness of government regulations. So in a way it was a good thing. Being an anarchist I often run into opposition trying to explain my disdain for the Feds so it was nice that my wife was finally on my side.

Though November started good, but quickly turned sour, I am optimistic that the month will end in happiness and full bellies. I love Thanksgiving.

90348,"Previously by Gary G. Kohls: Duty To Warn

Recurring mass shootings are a peculiarly American phenomenon, unless you count the carnage in the numerous nation-states recently invaded and destabilized by the American military. Everybody say in unison what we all should be thinking: ""thank you National Rifle Association"" and we also need to address that thanks to the lamentable weapons manufacturing lobbyist thugs who threaten into silence and inaction most of our elected officials in DC, Republican and Democrat, who can't resist taking the bribery money.

James Holmes was just another gun-wielding, brain-altered mass murderer who shot into a crowd after making impressively elaborate plans to do so, just like the 1999 Columbine shooters 13 miles as the crow flies from Aurora. And one of the first words out of the mouths of the media and ruling elites who ascended the pulpit are the obfuscating words ""senseless violence""; meaning, just don't speculate about the motives of the shooter; ""don't ask any unwanted questions;"" ""Trust us, we're the experts.""

Unfortunately, these experts are also likely to be beholden to the powers-that-be that aren't interested in curing the malady that is the epidemic of gun violence. The powers-that-be want to be sure that they will be held blameless when the final official report is released. Don't expect to be told everything that you need to know to make sense of mass shootings any time soon.

If there is evidence that will help to make sense out of something that will give us a fighting chance to prevent mass shootings in the future, expect that we won't be told about it until some courageous investigative journalist does the hard sleuthing work and then is allowed to report his findings. We will certainly be as confused about this one as most of us were about Columbine.

If the real connections explaining the Aurora shootings are suppressed, as expected, the approaching police state agenda of the 1% will be enabled. Prepare for metal detectors and private security firms frisking us as we stand in line to see the next violence-inducing shoot-em-up movie that will give ideas to some copy-cat wannabe avenger about competing for the Guiness Book of World Records for non-combat zone mass murders.

I have been listening and watching the repetitive and sensationalistic news coverage of the Aurora shootings for many hours over the first few days since the deed was officially labeled ""senseless"". Senseless violence is the mantra, just like the media and ruling elites repeated the lie that three World Trade Center towers, on 9/11/01, (only two having been hit by planes) were exploded, demolished and pulverized, not burned, into fine dust and each then fell into their own footprints at free fall speed, which only could happen if all the floors below the top floors had been disappeared by explosives ahead of time. Anybody who watched the event intuitively knew that these towers came down by controlled demolition but the constant propaganda campaign that followed convinced millions of us to not believe our own eyes but rather believe the provably false, heavily propagandized, Bush White House conspiracy theory. (WTC 7's obvious controlled demolition, by the way, was censored out of our consciousness by the media's lack of coverage, and it was not hit by a plane). But I digress.

<<<Who are the potential accessories to the crimes of the Batman Shooter?>>>

One has to wonder who are the ""sacred cow"" industries that have contributed to America's recurrent mass shootings. Many of them surely consider themselves too big to fail and therefore too big to expose, question, criticize, or implicate as unintentional accomplices. Any one of us can think of any number of potential culprits. My list includes this TOP 10 LIST plus 3:

the violent entertainment industry; the violent, and addictive videogame industry; violent professional contact sports, where bodily injury is applauded; the food industry that is doing so much to malnourish vulnerable brains and bodies; the gun lobby; the ease in getting lethal military style weapons (the Aurora killer reportedly got some of his guns at Gander Mountain); our militarized culture and the media that glorifies the ""legal"" mass murder by ""licensed to kill"" soldiers at war and then condemns them when they come home psychologically and spiritually tormented and commit ""illegal"" murders or suicides as civilians; Congresspersons, Presidents, state governors and Supreme Court judges who apathetically vote against or sit on existing rational harm-reduction legislation that could do so much to prevent these mass homicides; Christian church leaders who fail to teach to their potential mass murderers in their Sunday School and confirmation classes about the nonviolent Golden Rule ethics of Jesus, whom they profess to follow; and etc, etc. There are many potential culprits beyond those that could legally be blamed as being accessories to the crime of shooters like James Holmes.

But in the minds of many, the big culprits, and the ones that the corporate media and their paymasters are scared to death about being exposed, are

BigPharma (multinational pharmaceutical companies); the drug advertising industry that so diabolically shapes public attitudes and behaviors; and BigMedicine and us obedient and often enslaved physicians that are in its thrall who have, by and large, not opened our eyes to the data from the medical, forensic and pharmaceutical research community of altruistic researchers that are not beholden to pharmaceutical corporations. Much of this data shows unequivocally that most, if not all, of the five classes of potentially addictive psychiatric drugs are capable of causing drug-induced violence, drug-induced psychoses, drug-induced homicides, drug-induced mania, drug-induced suicidality, drug-induced dementia, drug-induced sleep disorders/sleep deprivation and drug-induced irrational criminal behaviors, especially in unsuspecting adolescents.

<<<He who pays the piper, calls the tune>>>

By ignoring the peer-reviewed complementary-alternative medical literature and only paying attention to what is in the pharmaceutical industry-controlled mainstream medical journals, we physicians and our employees regularly  and often quite cavalierly  prescribe potentially lethal, though entirely legal, brain and mind-altering synthetic chemicals that those wealthy and influential sponsors lie to us about when their sales staff claims that the drugs are safe, curative and non-addicting.

Therefore, considering that there is a massive amount of documented evidence (see below) of a strong connection between American school shootings and the use of (or withdrawal from) mind-altering, brain-numbing, remorselessness-inducing psych drugs, a fair question should be: ""Was the Batman Shooter taking or withdrawing from any one of the hundreds of psychiatric drugs so readily prescribed these days?"" Keep in mind that the James Holmes had considerable experience in graduate-level experimental neuroscience. That should logically make every criminal investigator ""focus like a laser"" into the possibility of mind-altering drugs influencing the shooter's beliefs, behaviors and thinking processes.

But no, we have heard nary a word about the potential of legal psych drug use or drug withdrawal in the case of the Batman Shooter. Every thinking person should smell a rat — a cover-up in the making.

<<<Bad advice: ""Don't waste time trying to figure out what motivated the shooter"" >>>

Amazingly, one of the survivors of the Columbine school shooter Eric Harris (who was taking the Prozac-like drug Luvox that was prescribed by his tragically unaware psychiatrist, Dr. K. Albert), contributed to the myth-making of these ""mass shooting crimes of the month"" when he advised the most recent batch of Colorado shooting victims to not ""waste time trying to figure out what motivated the shooter or shooters. It's a waste of time, and it gives them exactly what they want (sic)."" And then later in the interview he complained, ""I don't think I'll ever understand."" Duh.

Psychologically and spiritually, any psychologist or spiritual advisor worth his or her salt when dealing with the consequences of psychological trauma will tell you that that advice is profoundly anti-therapeutic and will certainly lead to delayed healing — probably permanently  of the trauma. One wonders what brain-altering, dependency-inducing psych drug that that victim has been taking for the last 13 years. Perhaps he has already tried to taper off the drug but then found out that he can't tolerate the disabling withdrawal symptoms, and therefore he has concluded that he truly needs the potentially neurotoxic drug.

But he is just repeating what the ""authorities"" always seem to tell us as they hide essential but ""sensitive"" information that might be uncomfortable for Holmes' doctors or clinics or family members or gun and ammunition suppliers or drug company or legislators or tormentors. Perhaps the authorities are trying to protect the various industries that rightfully need to be exposed for their part in the massacres, however indirect or controversial.

<<<""SSRI Stories: Senseless violence"" may be totally understandable if we are just given the inconvenient facts?>>>

James Holmes' actions would probably not be considered ""senseless"" if we knew the truth about everything that led up to the Batman shooting. The above-mentioned Columbine victim that is promoting blind ignorance has learned to echo what is already being promoted: keep everybody unaware of what the potential motives are; remain silent about certain painful truths; don't expose any of the powers-that-be for their part in the long lead-up to the shootings. Attitudes such as these will ensure that there will be many repeats in the future.

Not too long ago I mentioned in this column the remarkable database of serious SSRI (""selective"" serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the so-called ""second generation u2018antidepressants'"") adverse reactions that have been documented in the public domain. That website can be accessed at www.ssristories.com. When researching that important website, keep in mind that the vast majority of media reports on seemingly irrational criminal events usually don't ask the question in the title above  unless the drugs are illicit. So the thousands of examples documented and reported represent just the tip of what surely is an enormous iceberg.), since even the FDA estimates that up to 99% of adverse events from any given drug is never reported to that agency.

SSRI Stories is a collection of 4,800+ news stories (mainly criminal in nature) that have appeared in the media (newspapers, TV, scientific journals) or that were part of FDA public testimony in either 1991, 2004 or 2006, in which psych drugs are mentioned.

<<<What is the PDR trying to warn us physicians about when we prescribe antidepressants?>>>

The Physicians’ Desk Reference lists the following common adverse reactions (side effects) to SSRI antidepressants (among a host of other physical and neuropsychiatric effects). None of these adverse reactions is listed as Rare.

Manic Reaction (Mania, e.g., Kleptomania, Pyromania, Dipsomania, Nymphomania)

Hypomania (e.g., poor judgment, over spending, impulsivity, etc.)

Abnormal Thinking

Hallucinations

Personality Disorder

Amnesia

Agitation

Psychosis

Abnormal Dreams

Emotional Lability

Alcohol Abuse and/or Craving

Hostility

Paranoid Reactions

Confusion

Delusions

Sleep Disorders

Akathisia (Severe Inner Restlessness)

Withdrawal Syndrome

Impulsivity

The website emphasizes:

""Adverse reactions are most likely to occur when starting or discontinuing the drug, increasing or lowering the dose or when switching from one SSRI to another. Adverse reactions are often diagnosed as bipolar disorder when the symptoms may be entirely iatrogenic (treatment induced). Withdrawal, especially abrupt withdrawal, from any of these medications can cause severe neuropsychiatric and physical symptoms. It is important to withdraw extremely slowly from these drugs, often over a period of a year or more, under the supervision of a qualified and experienced specialist, if available. Withdrawal is sometimes more severe than the original symptoms or problems.""

<<<SSRI adverse reactions are actually predictable, understandable and therefore are usually not unexpected. They are not actually ""side effects"">>>

So with the list of common adverse effects of these drugs, I present below a ""short list"" of drug–associated violence over the past decade or two that was perpetrated by mostly young people who were involved in newsworthy shootings and whose psych drugs were identified, published or otherwise somehow reported to the public. Tragically, in the vast majority of psychiatric drug-related suicides, homicides or other types of irrational violence (what the media calls ""senseless"") prescription drugs are generally not reported in the corporate-controlled and subsidized media, where pharmaceutical companies advertise heavily, certainly exerting influences on how much investigative journalism is allowed. Again, he who calls the piper calls the tune.

The SSRI Stories website has, among its nearly 5000 entries, a list of 66 school shootings that are overwhelmingly and disproportionately American. The school shooter's list is often accompanied by suicidality caused by either taking or withdrawing from the drugs. There has been an explosion of such incidents since Prozac was introduced onto an unsuspecting market in 1989. Most of the developed world's drug regulatory agencies, including the FDA, have not tested these psychotropic drugs for safety or efficacy in humans under the age of 18 (either short term or long term) and therefore have not approved their use for that group (with rare exceptions). Therefore we physicians, when we prescribe these untested drugs to that underage group (that has immature brain development) are doing so ""off label"" and thus we are exposing ourselves to medico-legal risks.

Here is the sobering list.

Eric Harris age 17 (Zoloft then Luvox) and Dylan Klebold aged 18 in Colombine school shooting in Littleton, Colorado, killed 12 students and 1 teacher, and injured 23 others, before killing themselves. Klebold's medical records have never been made available to the public.

Jeff Weise, age 16, had been prescribed 60 mg/day of Prozac (three times the average starting dose for adults!) when he shot his grandfather, his grandfather's girlfriend and many fellow students at Red Lake, Minnesota. He then shot himself. 10 dead, 12 wounded.

Thirteen-year-old Chris Fetters killed his favorite aunt while taking Prozac. Twelve-year-old Christopher Pittman murdered both his grandparents while taking Zoloft. Thirteen-year-old Mathew Miller hung himself in his bedroom closet after taking Zoloft for 6 days. Fifteen-year-old Jarred Viktor stabbed his grandmother 61 times after 5 days on Paxil. Fifteen-year-old Kip Kinkel (on Prozac and Ritalin) shot his parents while they slept then went to school and opened fire killing 2 classmates and injuring 22 shortly after beginning Prozac treatment. Luke Woodham age 16 (Prozac) killed his mother and then killed two students, wounding six others. A Pocatello, ID (Zoloft) in 1998 had a Zoloft-induced seizure that caused an armed stand off at his school. Michael Carneal (Ritalin) a 14-year-old opened fire on students at a high school prayer meeting in West Paducah, Kentucky. Three teenagers were killed, five others were wounded.. Young man in Huntsville, Alabama (Ritalin) went psychotic chopping up his parents with an ax and also killing one sibling and almost murdering another. Andrew Golden, age 11, (Ritalin) and Mitchell Johnson, aged 14, (Ritalin) shot 15 people, killing four students, one teacher, and wounding 10 others. TJ Solomon, age 15, (Ritalin) high school student in Conyers, Georgia opened fire on and wounded six of his class mates. Rod Mathews, age 14, (Ritalin) beat a classmate to death with a bat.

James Wilson, age 19, (various psychiatric drugs) from Breenwood, South Carolina, took a .22 caliber revolver into an elementary school killing two young girls, and wounding seven other children and two teachers. Elizabeth Bush, age 13, (Paxil) was responsible for a school shooting in Pennsylvania Jason Hoffman (Effexor and Celexa)  school shooting in El Cajon, California

Jarred Viktor, age 15, (Paxil), after five days on Paxil he stabbed his grandmother 61 times. Chris Shanahan, age 15 (Paxil) in Rigby, ID who out of the blue killed a woman. Jeff Franklin (Prozac and Ritalin), Huntsville, AL, killed his parents as they came home from work using a sledge hammer, hatchet, butcher knife and mechanic’s file, then attacked his younger brothers and sister. Neal Furrow (Prozac) in LA Jewish school shooting reported to have been court-ordered to be on Prozac along with several other medications.

Kevin Rider, age 14, was withdrawing from Prozac when he died from a gunshot wound to his head. Initially it was ruled a suicide, but two years later, the investigation into his death was opened as a possible homicide. The prime suspect, also age 14, had been taking Zoloft and other SSRI antidepressants.

Alex Kim, age 13, hung himself soon after his prescription of Lexapro had been doubled.

Diane Routhier was prescribed Welbutrin for gallstone problems. Six days later, after suffering many adverse effects of the drug, she shot herself.

Billy Willkomm, an accomplished wrestler and a University of Florida student, was prescribed Prozac at the age of 17. His family found him dead of suicide — hanging from a tall ladder at the family’s Gulf Shore Boulevard home in July 2002.

Kara Jaye Anne Fuller-Otter, age 12, was on Paxil when she hung herself from a hook in her closet. Kara's parents said “…. the damn doctor wouldn’t take her off it and I asked him to when we went in on the second visit. I told him I thought she was having some sort of reaction to Paxil…"")

Gareth Christian, Vancouver, age 18, was on Paxil when he committed suicide in 2002,

(Gareth's father could not accept his son's death and killed himself)

Julie Woodward, age 17, was on Zoloft when she hung herself in her family's detached garage.

Matthew Miller was 13 saw a psychiatrist because he was having difficulty and school. The psychiatrist recommended Zoloft for him. Seven days after beginning the Zioloft samples, his mother found him dead… hanging by a belt from a laundry hook in his closet.

Kurt Danysh, age 18 and on Prozac, killed his father with a shotgun. He is now behind prison bars, and writes letters, trying to warn the world that SSRI drugs can kill.

Woody ____, age 37, committed suicide while in his 5th week of taking Zoloft. Shortly before his death his physician suggested doubling the dose of the drug. He had seen his physician only for insomnia. He had never been depressed, nor did he have any history of any mental illness symptoms.

A ten-year-old boy from Houston shot and killed his father after his Prozac dosage was increased.

15-year-old Hammad Memon shot and killed a fellow middle school student. He had been diagnosed with ADHD and depression and was taking Zoloft and ""other drugs for the conditions.""

22-year-old culinary student Matti Saari shot and killed 9 students and a teacher, and wounded another student, before killing himself. Saari was taking an SSRI and a benzodiazapine.

27-year-old Steven Kazmierczak shot and killed five people and wounded 21 others before killing himself in a Northern Illinois University auditorium. According to his girlfriend, he had recently been taking Prozac, Xanax and Ambien. Toxicology results showed that he still had trace amounts of Xanax in his system.

18-year-old Finnish gunman Pekka-Eric Auvinen had been taking antidepressants before he killed eight people and wounded a dozen more at Jokela High School  then he committed suicide.

14-year-old Asa Coon of Cleveland, shot and wounded four before taking his own life. Court records show Coon was on Trazodone.

16-year-old Jon Romano, taking medication for depression, fired a shotgun at a teacher in his New York high school.

Recently by Mark Sisson: Is It Primal? — Smoked Salmon, Nutritional Yeast, 5-Hour Energy Drinks, and Other Foods Scrutinized

Its Friday, everyone! And that means another Primal Blueprint Real Life Story from a Marks Daily Apple reader. If you have your own success story and would like to share it with me and the Marks Daily Apple community please contact me here. Ill continue to publish these each Friday as long as they keep coming in. Thank you for reading!

The first time it happened I panicked. My vision was slowly filling up with shiny blobs of light. Instinctively I went to a dark room and, 15 minutes in, I couldnt see. Eventually it ramped down just like it ramped up. And as soon as it cleared, the pain started. I was never one for much pain medication, so I just put a cold rag on my forehead and bore it. Then the nausea kicked in. The pain subsided after a few hours. But it happened again the next week. And the next.

The third time, I hyperventilated from the pain and my boyfriend drove me to the hospital at 2 a.m. A scan cleared me of any brain tumors and I was diagnosed with ocular migraines. The doctor gave me a prescription for a drug used to help cancer patients deal with nausea and told me to get a bottle of Excedrin.

People who have had ocular migraines know what Im talking about. It fills your world with panic. What will trigger it next? Bright white snow? Car headlights? My mother tells me my aunt gets shots to stop them, so I figure it must run in the family. I became attached to my sunglasses. Id wear them even at night sometimes to block building or street lights. I had to pull over in my car once because I couldnt see through the shinys, as I called them. Its not a good way to live. As a college sophomore, I was kept out of class and work with pain. I eventually learned to stop the pain by taking the Excedrin as soon as I saw the flashy lights. But that much medicine would leave me in a haze for the rest of the day.

Heres what gets me. As a sophomore, I had put on the freshman 15 and wanted to start the year eating healthy. I cut out all white grain products and switched to whole-grain bread and pasta. I ate healthy lean meats but would binge on sugar on the weekends. Years passed and I accepted migraines as a part of my life. I carried a big bottle of meds everywhere. Heres a look at my old diet:

I graduated college and married the boyfriend who drove me to the hospital. He was always overweight and I, being a journalist/graphic artist, was constantly bombarded with health information and the newest studies. So we tried a few of these popular trends to help him get his weight down (6-foot, 245). I wasnt as worried about mine at the time (5′ 7"", 145), but I figured I could stand to lose a few. We did P90X, the Abs Diet, lots of whole grains and really boring food. I still had migraines. I still had IBS, acne  oh and regular headaches, too!

349220,"Over the eons, many pithy thoughts and things have been scribbled, typed, chiseled and pounded about Truth, Revelation, Epiphany. Sliding down the razor blade of life, each of us has likely had a few of our own – but one Genuine True Revealing Epiphany may have zipped right past you before you had a chance to be appropriately dazzled and incorporate it into your collection of snappy come-backs and other rhetoric.

Maybe I can be of assistance before the News Cycle seals it in the achieves.

So waaay back in last month, outgoing (retiring, not gregarious) Sec o State Hillary Whitewater Clinton, gave her much anticipated testostermony [sick][sic][sic] to the Senate Foreign Relations Kabuki concerning the Debacle Formerly Known as “Benghazi” along with the the facts that the administration attributed the attack to Muslim reaction to a video no one had seen and that the administration held to that story for almost 15 days. While the brazen vacuity of her “answers” in response to stupendously unprepared Stupid Party Members’ questions was worthy of eyebrows arched to Charlie-horse proportions, it was then The Moment may have gotten passed you — or, at the very least, the enormity of its implications: SoS (a fitting acronym) Clinton, in full bluster responding to the impertinent questioning of Sen. Ron Johnson (Redundant-Never-Never Land), bellowed the perfect expectoration “WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?”

So there you have it: One (1) USDA Choice True Revelation Epiphany in one moderately unbecoming, undiplomatic belch. And while the repulsiveness of that conceited flatulence is now recorded for all personkind, its’ horrible stench, with an encompassing efficaciousness that boggles the senses of mere mortals, has not received the notoriety it so richly deserves.

For if we really wish to drain all the significance from the dregs of this socialist gasbag, we need to appreciate the multiple uses this simple, eloquent and pseudo-exasperated question actually answers – in a rhetorical sort of way.

For example, take the fog fest over the current attacks on the 2nd Amendment. Please. Sadly, both sides haven’t come up with any really cool bumper sticker catch phrases since ‘From My Cold Dead Fingers”. But now, the race is on to see which side can appropriate unto themselves the check-mating TRE (True Revelation Epiphany): WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

See how simple? No more dithering over the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Who needs Uncle or Aunty Federalist anyway? We have our answer to every past, present and future poll, stat, fact, historical account and law – even the colorful Graph Brothers (Bar and Pie): WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

You say: Big Dilly! What else ya got?

Thanks for axing.

How about the Stupid Economy? We most certainly have a Spending/Revenue Problem. But WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? Are the Brainiacs inside the Logic Free Zone going to actually do something after 30+ years of saying they’re going to do something? Riddle me that one, TurboTax Man.

Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, the “entitlements” – all out of control; “unsustainable”, they say. All now forecast to be running on empty long before we were promised the Promised Land. Accountability may be worse than jock itch – but “WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?”

To fully appreciate the One Phrase Fits All applicability on other formerly pressing issues, ask yourself: Whatever happened to any final incriminating conclusions re Eric Holder’s “Fast & Furious” scandal? WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

Heard anything about Maj. Nidal Hisan’s Workplace Abuse trial-stopping beard lately? It’s been over 3 years, ya know? WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

The toxicology autopsy report on psychotropic drugs Newtown executioner Adam Lanza was popping 12/14/12? Go ahead: WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT…….

I think you’ve got the hang of it now.

See what a remarkable contribution the Smartest Woman in the World (1993-2001) contributed to us, The Great Unwashed? Inside the LFZ (see above), our Washington leaders pretty much always take full responsibility for whatever has gone wrong (NB: Except the President. In that case, it’s all Bush’s fault). And why not? There are no consequences. No one resigns or loses their cushy Federal gig. So it means nothing to say it. Standing on their two hind feet and braying “I take full responsibility” actually works out to absolving anyone from taking actual responsibility.

Maybe the new SoS John “Make Mine Heinz” Kerry, won’t have to endure similar pesky questions from uppity Senators, Congressmen, Blow-Dry Media, even the More or Less Miserables among us who might be inclined to ask out of concern for what shreds may be left of the Rule of Law.

Accountability. Responsibility. Capability. Culpability. Oh, sorry – these words have no applicability here. I’m merely posting them for you to get one final look at them before Winston Smith does his thing.

Attention spans being what they are these days (see Attention Deficit Democracy, James Bovard) and considering the LRC Word Count Police, let’s take the bull by the tail and facing our future squarely: remember to use, appreciate and take comfort in that New All-Purpose, Fast-Acting, Poly-Unsaturated, One-Size-Fits-All Cure-All for the Common Empire – say it with me now: WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

Feel better?

BTW and FYI: that ‘anti-Islam’ Youtube video maker who was blamed for starting all this? He’s still moldering in some California jail in lieu of SoS and POTUS.

274561,"I received a message today from someone who questioned the position I had taken in a recent op-ed article on the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Because I was unable to get a reply through to the person who wrote to me, and because others might have the same concern he raised, I am placing his question and my reply to him here.

He wrote:

The last paragraph of your most recent article puzzles me. You say: The oil pollution in the Gulf is already hurting residents, workers and business owners and causing heartbreaking damage to marshlands, beaches and the wildlife that inhabits the area’s waters and wetlands. Let us hope the terrible situation will not be politically leveraged into measures that cause even greater damage to the national economy.

So if I get this right, you are saying that heartbreaking damage is being caused, but keep on drillin! But your concern is the national economy. What happened to preventing the heartbreaking damage?

I replied as follows:

Virtually everything people do carries risks. Certainly every form of production does so. All manufacturing processes are risky — as a young man I worked in a factory where I saw a man’s hand ground to pulp when it was caught between two large gears of a machine. All farming activities are risky — as a young man I worked on a farm where a man was crushed to death by a tractor that lurched forward while he was underneath it doing repairs and another was killed when a tractor he was operating on the side of a ditch tipped over, throwing him off and crushing him beneath its weight. All transportation is risky — thousands die in traffic accidents each year in this country. All of these things are heartbreaking. Yet, for good reason, we do not imagine that we would be better off if we forbade manufacturing, agriculture, and transportation.

The Deepwater Horizon accident that continues to foul the Gulf’s waters and shores was an unlikely but extremely destructive event. The damage it is causing is heartbreaking. But forbidding oil drilling in the Gulf would also cause immense damage, not least to the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people whose incomes are tied to that activity, not to mention all those who value the products made from the oil extracted from pools beneath the ocean floor. We can’t have all good things and no bad things. In life as it actually exists, we must choose and make trade-offs.

Recently by William L. Anderson: Should Government Try To Extend Booms Indefinitely?

In a recent Wall Street Journal article, prosecutor Glenn McGovern writing about the recent shooting of two prosecutors in Texas asked, ""Who will protect the protectors?"" He wrote:

Working to make America less dangerous can be dangerous. The shocking murders of justice-system officials this year in Texas and Colorado are only among the most recent grim reminders of an everyday threat.

The article brings up an obvious question: Does anyone feel protected by police and prosecutors? Better yet, it seems appropriate to ask: Who will protect innocent citizens from the predations of police and prosecutors hellbent on framing innocent people for crimes, sometimes even ""crimes"" that never were committed?

This is not a superfluous question. The vast majority of people who have any interaction with an on-duty police officer do so under duress. Either they are stopped for a traffic violation or are being arrested or are being ordered around. In extreme situations, they are on the receiving end of abuse, either during a home invasion (called a ""no-knock raid"") or an unpleasant encounter on the street.

As I noted in a previous article, the murders in question seem to have been professional killings, not the acts of someone angry they were put into jail or put on trial. The perpetrators, one supposes, are tied to drug gangs which are a creation of the War on Drugs, something that has benefitted and enriched both police and prosecutors. If their Sugar Daddy turns sour, it is not due to a lack of protection of the ""protectors,"" but rather the simple fact that the drug war is out of control.

When they come to court, cops often lie under oath (they call it ""testilying"") and prosecutors often withhold exculpatory evidence, lie to jurors and judges, and engage in false and malicious prosecutions. And for all of the publicity that wrongful prosecutions and rogue prosecutors like the infamous Michael Nifong receive when sanctioned, it is extremely rare for prosecutors to be disciplined for misconduct and no prosecutor in U.S. History ever has gone to prison for breaking the law in pursuit of a criminal case even though Nifong and many others have regularly trashed the law and clearly engaged in illegal conduct that breaks criminal statutes.

(I should add that Nifong committed a number of felonies during the lacrosse case, including fraudulent use of thousands of federal dollars, lying to a grand jury, ordering his investigator to strong-arm witnesses into changing their stories, and lying under oath during his North Carolina State Bar hearing. He did serve one day in jail for lying to a judge about hiding evidence, but neither state nor federal authorities decided to conduct criminal investigations into his conduct. His losing the ability to practice law was mild compared with what the three lacrosse players were facing — life imprisonment — had they been convicted in what most likely would have been a kangaroo court had they gone to trial.)

I would put the questions to readers: Has any reader ever been protected by a police officer? Has any reader ever had a positive experience with prosecutors? Has any reader ever had a negative encounter with the police? Has any reader ever been wrongly prosecuted?

While McGovern claims, ""Men and women responsible for seeking justice within the courts and ensuring public safety are increasingly becoming targets,"" he uses some shaky statistics. First, he claims the following:

Each year in this country, well over 100 police officers are killed in the line of duty. Those who enter such careers do so fully cognizant of these dangers.

That is true, but what McGovern does not say is that the vast majority of officers killed lose their lives in car accidents and other accidents; they are not often gunned down by criminals seeking revenge and lose their lives in shootouts in very few situations. In fact, police work is statistically safer than most other occupations. Radley Balko writes:

It’s been a little more than a year since media outlets and police organizations first started reporting about a mounting “war on cops.” Law enforcement officials and commentators blamed budget shortfalls, anti-government sentiment, gun ownership and other causes for the rising violence against police.

We’re now about halfway through 2012, and this year is on pace to be the safest ever for America’s police officers. Oddly, no one is reporting it.

Fifty officers have died on duty so far this year, a 44-percent decrease from last year, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund (NLEOMF). More remarkably, 17 have died from gunfire, down 55 percent from last year. (21 died in traffic accidents, the remaining 12 in various other incidents.) If the second half of this year follows the first, fewer officers will have died on duty this year than in any year since 1944, a time when there were far, far fewer police officers.

In other words, contrary to what McGovern would have us believe, the ""war on cops"" is nonexistent. To be honest, it is more likely that an innocent person will be shot and killed by a cop (who usually will face no legal sanctions for the killing) than it is a cop being gunned down. (One thing to remember is that the statistics do not differentiate between a police officer being shot by fellow officers or by someone else with hostile intent.)

If there is a ""war,"" it is a government/police war on ordinary people. Ever since the Ronald Reagan administration began to sell surplus military gear to local police departments, the militarization of the police has grown exponentially. Nearly every police force has a paramilitary SWAT team, even in localities where there historically has been no violent crime.

Each year, the horror stories of police raids gone badly are brought to our attention — and each year, the number of police home invasions increases, and this year there will be close to 80,000 such ""raids,"" often done against people for simple drug possession (and many don't have drugs or any other illegal items in their homes). As for ""protectors,"" when police engage in these raids, they are protecting no one and certainly any legal doctrine that says police can invade anyone's house for whatever reason they want is not a doctrine that ""protects"" the general public.

(Even when police invade the wrong house or kill an unarmed person or destroy property needlessly, they rarely are disciplined and in almost all cases, the police departments do ""internal investigations"" and — not surprisingly — declare themselves not to be at fault and all of their actions, no matter how egregious, to be fully justified.)

At least one can sue police departments and the municipalities that employ them. Prosecutors, both state and federal, enjoy absolute immunity from lawsuits regardless of their misconduct, and often the misconduct can be personally destructive:

In 10 cases identified by ProPublica, defendants convicted at least in part because of a prosecutor's abuse were ultimately exonerated, often after years in prison.

Shih-Wei Su was incarcerated for 12 years on attempted murder charges before a federal appeals court cleared him, finding that a prosecutor had ""knowingly elicited false testimony"" in winning a conviction. The city (New York) eventually paid Su $3.5 million. The prosecutor received nothing more than a private reprimand.

Jabbar Collins served 15 years in prison for a murder he didn't commit before his conviction was thrown out in 2010; Michael Vecchione, a senior Brooklyn prosecutor, had withheld critical evidence during trial. Collins has filed a $150 million lawsuit against the city. No action has been taken against Vecchione.

Last July, two men filed lawsuits for a combined $240 million against the city for wrongful convictions that a state appeals court found were won in part because Manhattan prosecutors had withheld evidence. The men served 36 years in prison, collectively. The prosecutor, who long ago left the district attorney's office, has not been publicly disciplined.

The lack of discipline for prosecutors that have broken the law is hardly limited to New York City. In 2010, Tonya Craft was put on trial in Catoosa County, Georgia, on what clearly were trumped-up charges of child molestation. The prosecutors, Christopher Arnt and Len Gregor, had a number of illegal (and secret) meetings with the judge, Brian House, who did everything he could to keep out exculpatory evidence.

However, despite the massive misconduct by Arnt and Gregor (which I have outlined many times in my own blog), the jurors quickly saw through the lies and acquitted Craft. When I spoke to the office of the Georgia State Bar that disciplines attorneys, I was told in no uncertain terms that the Georgia Bar considered what clearly would be illegal conduct by prosecutors to be just ""doing their jobs."" The assistant to the director remarked to me, ""She was acquitted, wasn't she?"" I replied that Craft and her family had to spend a million dollars to defend herself, but the Georgia State Bar official was unmoved. When I asked her if suborning perjury and lying during closing arguments (deliberately misrepresenting the testimony of an expert witness for the defense) constituted “doing their jobs,” she hung up on me.

And Georgia and New York are not unique. They are the system. Understand that individuals who have been wronged cannot seek legal satisfaction because the courts have given prosecutors and judges absolute immunity, and at the same time, governments refuse to take action against their own, something that should surprise no one.

Police and prosecutors are fond of claiming they ""protect"" the public from ""the bad guys."" There only is one problem with that; for the most part, police and prosecutors are the ""bad guys,"" and the government has said that we are not permitted to protect ourselves from these predators. As for a so-called War on Cops, there is a war, but it is not on the cops or prosecutors. No, these people are at war with Americans who are not politically or legally-connected.

Today, millions of Americans will validate their faith in the secular religion of democracy by going to the polls, as they do every four years, to choose between two basically interchangeable candidates, both of whom were, as always, hand-picked by the power elite because they can be trusted to dutifully perpetuate their system.

The False Choice

This fact is evidenced not only by the similarity of the presidential candidates every four years, but also by the shallowness of mainstream political discourse, where fundamental questions about the power elite’s system are not allowed; rather, acceptable debate is limited to the minutiae of micromanaging the system, to fairly trivial distractions that wouldn’t even be contentious issues in a free society — like gay marriage and stem cell research, and to the personal character of the candidates.

For example, the moral legitimacy of the income tax, or of the federal government extracting about $$3 trillion per year from the productive economy, is not discussed; instead, the ""debate"" is on whether at what income levels to place the tax code’s gradations, whether to slightly raise or lower any of the gradation’s tax rates, or whether this or that expense should qualify for a deduction.

Nor are the moral legitimacy, constitutionality, or the results of the Drug War discussed; instead, the ""debate"" is limited to whether a certain substance should be a Schedule I or Schedule II drug, whether marijuana should be allowed for patients with certain medical conditions under certain, rigidly stipulated circumstances, or whether the penalties for a certain drug offense should be raised, or remain the same.

Nor are such questions allowed about the ""War on Terror,"" the military-industrial complex, and the medical- and pharmaceutical-industrial complexes, the Federal Reserve, or any other part of the system.

Any major-party presidential candidate who raises such fundamental questions, such as Ron Paul, is ridiculed by ""mainstream"" (system-perpetuating) politicians and journalists, and is continually dismissed in a self-fulfilling prophecy as a ""fringe"" candidate with no chance to win.

And third-party candidates, who almost always raise such questions, are crippled by law from raising money or getting ballot access, and are excluded from debates with the major candidates, even if only one or two of them meet some reasonable criteria for inclusion.

The Establishment

The regimented discourse is due to the fact that there’s a small elite who really run the country — and they run it for their own purposes. They have a system in place — which consists of things like the income tax, the Federal Reserve System, the medical- and pharmaceutical-industrial complexes, other regulation of business, the military-industrial complex, and drug prohibition — by which they attain levels of income and power that they could not attain on the market, through voluntary exchange.

But that system harms the standard of living of the average person, which is why the elite would not be able to maintain it — and their status as (unnatural) elites — through voluntary exchange. But, thanks in no small part to the 12 years of forced government brainwashing of compulsory public schools that are also an important part of the power elite’s system, most people believe the system is there for their benefit and protection.

And, when the system causes problems, the elite distract the average person with the sideshow of politics and the illusion of two competing parties. As Murray Rothbard explained in one of his last essays, discussing the 1994 Republican Revolution, if the elite made it overtly obvious that there’s only one party, any problems would be an indictment of the entire system, which would then become widely despised and likely to be overthrown. Instead, people are distracted by the illusion of competing parties, which are really part of the same system.

Vote early, and vote often

We can see how effective this distraction is by how many people get caught up in the irrelevance of politics. Though it’s mostly not their fault, but is the result of conditioning, when the government’s actions cause problems, rarely is the average person sophisticated enough to indict the fundamental system. Instead, if the Republicans are in power and he’s a Democrat, he indicts the Republicans, and focuses on electing more Democrats; if he’s a Republican, he indicts the Democrats, or ""liberals,"" for somehow corrupting Republican principles, or he claims that many of the elected Republicans aren’t ""real"" Republicans. And vice-versa.

Thus he reveals a deep psychological need to convince himself that the problems caused by the system are not inherent in government, but are the result of the ""wrong"" people being in charge, that if he can somehow get ""them"" out and ""us"" in, all will be well again. To believe otherwise would cause him to question his ideas about government and democracy — which, due to his years of conditioning, are among his most fundamental beliefs. Only when he somehow becomes consciously aware of fundamental questions about the system’s legitimacy (and maybe not even then) will he begin to go against his conditioning.

Writing last year about our farcical presidential elections, I expanded on Dr. Rothbard’s essay when I pointed out that there’s no reason to believe that America would be measurably freer if anyone who lost any of the last generation’s presidential elections had won.

McBama vs. O’Bain

This year is no different; while there may be some fairly trivial differences between them, in the grand scheme of things, it makes no fundamental difference whether McCain or Obama is elected — the underlying system will continue under either of them.

For anyone who doubts this, let’s look at Obama’s and McCain’s stated positions, and see if we can figure out what everyone is so worked up about.

216401,"The Bush administration

and the National Security Agency (NSA) have been secretly monitoring

the email messages and phone calls of all Americans. They are doing

this, they say, for our own good. To find terrorists. Many people

have criticized NSA’s domestic spying as unlawful invasion of privacy,

as search without search warrant, as abuse of power, as misuse of

the NSA’s resources, as unConstitutional, as something the communists

would do, something very unAmerican.

In addition,

however, mass surveillance of an entire population cannot find terrorists.

It is a probabilistic impossibility. It cannot work.

What is the

probability that people are terrorists given that NSA’s mass surveillance

identifies them as terrorists? If the probability is zero (p=0.00),

then they certainly are not terrorists, and NSA was wasting resources

and damaging the lives of innocent citizens. If the probability

is one (p=1.00), then they definitely are terrorists, and NSA has

saved the day. If the probability is fifty-fifty (p=0.50), that

is the same as guessing the flip of a coin. The conditional probability

that people are terrorists given that the NSA surveillance system

says they are, that had better be very near to one (p=1.00) and

very far from zero (p=0.00).

The mathematics

of conditional probability were figured out by the Scottish logician

Thomas Bayes. If you Google ""Bayes’ Theorem"", you will

get more than a million hits. Bayes’ Theorem is taught in all elementary

statistics classes. Everyone at NSA certainly knows Bayes’ Theorem.

To know if

mass surveillance will work, Bayes’ theorem requires three estimations:

The base-rate

for terrorists, i.e. what proportion of the population are terrorists; The accuracy

rate, i.e., the probability that real terrorists will be identified

by NSA; The misidentification

rate, i.e., the probability that innocent citizens will be misidentified

by NSA as terrorists.

No matter how

sophisticated and super-duper are NSA’s methods for identifying

terrorists, no matter how big and fast are NSA’s computers, NSA’s

accuracy rate will never be 100% and their misidentification rate

will never be 0%. That fact, plus the extremely low base-rate for

terrorists, means it is logically impossible for mass surveillance

to be an effective way to find terrorists.

I will not

put Bayes’ computational formula here. It is available in all elementary

statistics books and is on the web should any readers be interested.

But I will compute some conditional probabilities that people are

terrorists given that NSA’s system of mass surveillance identifies

them to be terrorists.

The US Census

shows that there are about 300 million people living in the USA.

Suppose that

there are 1,000 terrorists there as well, which is probably a high

estimate. The base-rate would be 1 terrorist per 300,000 people.

In percentages, that is .00033%, which is way less than 1%. Suppose

that NSA surveillance has an accuracy rate of .40, which means that

40% of real terrorists in the USA will be identified by NSA’s monitoring

of everyone’s email and phone calls. This is probably a high estimate,

considering that terrorists are doing their best to avoid detection.

There is no evidence thus far that NSA has been so successful at

finding terrorists. And suppose NSA’s misidentification rate is

.0001, which means that .01% of innocent people will be misidentified

as terrorists, at least until they are investigated, detained and

interrogated. Note that .01% of the US population is 30,000 people.

With these suppositions, then the probability that people are terrorists

given that NSA’s system of surveillance identifies them as terrorists

is only p=0.0132, which is near zero, very far from one. Ergo, NSA’s

surveillance system is useless for finding terrorists.

Suppose that

NSA’s system is more accurate than .40, let’s say, .70, which means

that 70% of terrorists in the USA will be found by mass monitoring

of phone calls and email messages. Then, by Bayes’ Theorem, the

probability that a person is a terrorist if targeted by NSA is still

only p=0.0228, which is near zero, far from one, and useless.

Suppose that

NSA’s system is really, really, really good, really, really good,

with an accuracy rate of .90, and a misidentification rate of .00001,

which means that only 3,000 innocent people are misidentified as

terrorists. With these suppositions, then the probability that people

are terrorists given that NSA’s system of surveillance identifies

them as terrorists is only p=0.2308, which is far from one and well

below flipping a coin. NSA’s domestic monitoring of everyone’s email

and phone calls is useless for finding terrorists.

NSA knows this.

Bayes’ Theorem is elementary common knowledge. So, why does NSA

spy on Americans knowing it’s not possible to find terrorists that

way? Mass surveillance of the entire population is logically sensible

only if there is a higher base-rate. Higher base-rates arise from

two lines of thought, neither of them very nice:

McCarthy-type

national paranoia; political

espionage.

The whole NSA

domestic spying program will seem to work well, will seem logical

and possible, if you are paranoid. Instead of presuming there are

1,000 terrorists in the USA, presume there are 1 million terrorists.

Americans have gone paranoid before, for example, during the McCarthyism

era of the 1950s. Imagining a million terrorists in America puts

the base-rate at .00333, and now the probability that a person is

a terrorist given that NSA’s system identifies them is p=.99, which

is near certainty. But only if you are paranoid. If NSA’s surveillance

requires a presumption of a million terrorists, and if in fact there

are only 100 or only 10, then a lot of innocent people are going

to be misidentified and confidently mislabeled as terrorists.

The ratio of

real terrorists to innocent people in the prison camps of Guantanamo,

Abu Ghraib, and Kandahar shows that the US is paranoid and is not

bothered by mistaken identifications of innocent people. The ratio

of real terrorists to innocent people on Bush’s no-fly lists shows

that the Bush administration is not bothered by mistaken identifications

of innocent Americans.

Also, mass

surveillance of the entire population is logically plausible if

NSA’s domestic spying is not looking for terrorists, but looking

for something else, something that is not so rare as terrorists.

For example, the May 19 Fox News opinion poll of 900 registered

voters found that 30% dislike the Bush administration so much they

want him impeached. If NSA were monitoring email and phone calls

to identify pro-impeachment people, and if the accuracy rate were

.90 and the error rate were .01, then the probability that people

are pro-impeachment given that NSA surveillance system identified

them as such, would be p=.98, which is coming close to certainty

(p=1.00). Mass surveillance by NSA of all Americans’ phone calls

and emails would be very effective for domestic political intelligence.

But finding

a few terrorists by mass surveillance of the phone calls and email

messages of 300 million Americans is mathematically impossible,

and NSA certainly knows that.

3101.08 Who may solemnize marriages.

An ordained or licensed minister of any religious society or congregation within this state who is licensed to solemnize marriages … may join together as husband and wife any persons who are not prohibited by law from being joined in marriage.

3101.09 Prohibition

No person, except those legally authorized, shall attempt to solemnize a marriage, and no marriage shall be solemnized without the issuance of a license.

~ Ohio Revised Code (emphasis added)

An open letter to my fellow Christians:

Is marriage a union between husband and wife, sanctified by God? Or is marriage a legal contract between parties as defined by the state, witnessed by the state, and justified by the state?

It appears from the references above that the latter holds true. A marriage is not a religious ceremony — to be sure, you can always include a religious ceremony, if you so choose. Instead, a marriage is a civil act presided over by an official of the state or a person licensed to act as an official of the state. This is an important clarification to note since it is becoming obvious that the Christian Church — by its own actions — has supplanted God with government.

As a Church, we have allowed government to define that which is a blessing from God. And we accept the state’s definition without question. To the Church, a couple is considered married if and only if they possess a valid, state-issued license stating the same. And a couple is divorced if and only if the state has granted the divorce. By agreeing to this state of affairs, the church has put the state before God.

Now, my good friends, we have done this to ourselves. Our religious forefathers used the power of government to exalt the Church. You see, we — the Church — didn’t want just anyone performing marriages. No, we wanted only a select few to sanctify the union of husband and wife. We sought legislation that would create a privileged class; a class — licensed clergy, civil judges, etc. — defined and controlled by the state. It worked for a while, but we now reap that which we sow.

In our exuberance to right the world, we forgot that government is not the Church, not under any circumstances. Yet, in the name of salvation, we unleashed government as the entity that is now working to unravel two of society’s most important institutions — family and church.

Even while this plays out before our eyes — as if from a revelation spoken by a modern-day prophet, we continue to fight for a stronger state in hopes that our Baal will return us to God’s favor.

So we fight for marriage amendments, as if God cares an iota about a government license. God’s word is true, it’s final. However, as long as the Church looks to government for its justification, the Church will remain a bondservant to the state.

This process — the change from the Church worshipping God to worshipping the state — has been a long time coming. It was some 150 years ago when the Church began to partner with the modern state. The partnership was to the liking of all involved: the Church still had some control over the beast (the Leviathan), and the beast provided the manna — or fiat money — and force that made all things possible. But the state also used the Church to justify its existence and ever-growing influence. A few manifestations soon became apparent, manifestations that should have caused the Church to end the relationship, yet the relationship only grew stronger.

However, looking back, the changes are easy to see. Soon after the church/state partnership began, the following took place:

Government slowly grew more influential and the balance of power tipped in its favor. To many Christians, government became the agent of change. No longer were prayers needed as manna fell with the blessings of the saints in the state capitals and the District of Columbia With the focus on the state, God was dropped from the equation. The state became the savior; the second coming. And the Church became ever more irrelevant.

At each stage, the Church never looked askance of the state. It never called the state into question. No, and in fact, the Church continued — and continues — to seek the state for matters that are the duty of the Church.

Currently, we see the growth of the social justice movement; a thinly veiled effort to move the Church ever closer to the state. Certainly, as Christians, we are supposed to help those less fortunate. But we were never granted the power to thieve tax dollars for any reason.

The New Testament brought about a new covenant: a covenant between God and believer. This covenant does not provide a mandate to force others to perform acts of kindness. Each of us must work out his or her own salvation in fear and trembling — our fear and our trembling before God. We are not to be the bullies with the gun spreading physical fear and reducing other to trembling before the state.

To keep its power, the state holds the Church on a short leash: the threat of tax status. Even though Jesus was clear regarding rendering unto Caesar, the Church is more concerned about its tax-exempt status than doing the work of God. So for a few pieces of silver, or worthless paper, the state runs the show.

As long as the Church seeks government authority over issues such as marriage, as long as the Church partners with the state for social justice, the state wins.

We must ask ourselves: How can the Church even consider debating biblical truths with an earthly power — whether good or evil? And, why does the Church continue to recognize the claims of the state? The answer is simple: The state has become our Baal; our road to destruction.

The Church needs to forget the state — ignore it. Churches must define and recognize marriages as the Bible instructs. Forget the licensing of clergy; it is an abomination — the state defining church leadership. And, the Church must no longer partner with the state on any endeavor — the Church must never be yoked with the beast.

Liberty is our blessing. Nothing good has ever come from the marriage of Church and State.

Armed with such realism, the student of Augustine has no illusions about the utopia of the world state. He is prudent, cautious, and restrained. . . . he is braced for the interminable conflicts of world politics, for pressure, tension, and power politics are inherent in the nature of things human, and no panacea of human construction can eliminate these realities.

The bedrock Catholic conviction [is] that stuff counts. . . . Whenever and however it appears, though, gnosticism teaches the same seductive and devastating message: stuff doesn't count . . . what counts is the gnosis, the arcane knowledge, that lifts the elect, the elite, out of the grubbiness of the quotidian.

— George Weigel, Letters to a Young Catholic

Introduction:

Having set out in preceding chapters an analysis of how well the war met each of the six classic just war criteria, it is now appropriate to consider one set of objections as a group. In the run-up to the war, some of the most prominent voices proclaiming how just war theory should be applied to the war belonged to a small group that, on this issue at least, seemed strongly identified with the American neo-conservatives: Weigel, Neuhaus (RIP), and Johnson. While they used the six criteria used here, they clearly showed themselves, despite occasional diffidence, to be part of the pro-war camp.

These writers claim for themselves the just war theory mantles of Thomas Aquinas, Augustine, and Cicero. Classic just war theory, they wrote before and after the war began, was a far different thing from what many anti-war writers were assuming or stating. However, many of the claims they made concerning others who spoke and wrote on the subject seem based on distortions of classic theory carefully considered. Five major themes of these writers, and one major omission, bear critiquing.

The ""Presumption Against War""

The Problem As Some Neoconservatives See It

There is a struggle within the ranks of just war theorists over how to frame the theory. Certain writers have made heavy weather of the statement by the Catholic bishops of the United States, and others, that just war theory begins with ""a presumption against war,"" or sometimes ""a presumption against force."" Johnson, for example, writes (in The War to Oust Saddam Hussein, 27),

The Challenge of Peace [by the Catholic bishops in 1983] described Catholic just war doctrine as beginning with a general ""presumption against war"" and represented the jus ad bellum criteria as guidance for determining whether this presumption should be overruled in particular cases or not. The classical tradition, by contrast, had thought of the use of force as morally neutral, good when a war was determined to be just (justum bellum), a use of force by the sovereign authority of a political community for a just cause, rather narrowly defined, and with a right intention, defined negatively as the avoidance of a number of wrong motives, including self-aggrandizement, theft, bullying, and action out of hatred of the other simply for being the other, and defined positively as intended to establish or restore peace. To cast the just war idea as beginning with a general presumption against war was to make it into something different from what the classic idea had been.

For Johnson, this different beginning turns the whole of just war theory into a different thing. He poses the question ""whether the just war proponents here did not give up too much [by adopting the ""presumption""], making the idea of just war over into a position effectively pacifist in practice. But the deeper question is whether the result was faithful to the classic idea of just war at all."" (War to Oust, 28),

The ""presumption,"" besides being wrong, also leads in the wrong direction. A little later (War to Oust, 29), Johnson remarks,

I have often wondered why the aim of peace was left out of the just war jus ad bellum as stated by The Challenge of Peace; I think it is because once one has begun by describing war as something always negative, it is conceptually impossible to represent it as a way to peace. This is profoundly different from the sensibility expressed in classic just war thought, where armed force is a tool that may be used for good or ill and where the assumption was not ""against war"" but against the evil and injustice that unfortunately abound in the affairs of men and nations, which armed force may be required to remedy. Augustine explained the end of peace in these terms: ""We do not seek peace in order to be at war, but we go to war that we may have peace."" This is an idea wholly lacking in The Challenge of Peace, which frames peace wholly in terms of the absence of war, despite the threats to peace that may remain.

Thus, for Johnson, this starting point is so badly mistaken that if you begin just war theory here, you are already wrong, and you are almost sure to go further wrong. Besides the prevailing fear of nuclear war, Johnson blames the adoption of the ""presumption against war"" among the Catholic bishops on a desire to share as much ground as possible with pacifists within the Church, as well as to accommodate a general pacifist sentiment: ""The presumption against war idea provided a middle ground on which those who favored a just war approach and the pacifists could come together: both shared that presumption"" (War to Oust, 28).

Johnson is far from alone in this critique. Weigel made much the same point in 1987 in his book Tranquillitas Ordinis: The Present Failure and Future Promise of American Catholic Thought on War and Peace. According to Peter Dula, the book alleges ""that liberal Catholic theologians and ethicists, under the influence of u2018an anti-anti-Communist' ideology and a naïve pacifism, abandoned a proper understanding of the just-war tradition."" In the buildup to and during the Iraq war, Weigel returned to these themes in a series of articles in the magazine First Things. Many of Weigel and Johnson's writings on just war in recent years include long, detailed rebuttals of those who believe in ""starting"" just war thinking with a ""presumption against war.""

After Johnson covered this ground in an essay in First Things in January 2005 (""Just War, As It Was and Is""), to its credit, First Things went on to publish an ""exchange"" (""Who Wants War? An Exchange"") in April of that year between Paul Griffiths and George Weigel on the ""presumption."" Griffiths argued that as a matter of logic alone, for any action that is permitted in some circumstances but not permitted in others, there is a presumption against that action. He argued that the various restrictions against granting drivers' licenses in his state (the age restriction, requirement to pass tests (vision and driving), etc.) amounted to a rebuttable presumption against granting licenses. Griffiths wrote that Johnson's argument against the ""presumption"" in his January 2005 essay ""amount[ed] to nothing more than the blowing of thick clouds of smoke."" Weigel replied, beginning with a humorous parable about a father who, after numerous warnings, finally spanks a child who is playing with matches and trying to set a pile of leaves by the garage on fire, a story meant to demonstrate that there is not ""a presumption against spanking."" He went on to list numerous minor, straightforward conditions for getting a driver's license, rhetorically asking, ""Does any of this reasonably constitute u2018a presumption against licensing drivers' which the state can u2018override' when certain other conditions are met?"" Just because there are conditions to be met before some activity is permitted, in other words, that does not constitute a presumption against that activity.

Just War Theory Is Not Pacifism in Disguise

Before embarking on a critique of Weigel and Johnson and the ""anti-presumptionists,"" it should be stated that they are correct in their assertion that some writers have defined just war theory in such terms that it is either much weaker than the teaching of Aquinas, or even verges on pacifism. Griffiths himself, in an earlier paired article with Weigel (""Just War: An Exchange,"" April 2002) in First Things, claimed that accurate knowledge of whether there is a just cause for a proposed war is impossible for citizens to get, therefore they may not, according to just war theory, consider any war to be just. While Griffiths' seems right that getting accurate information on a proposed war is quite difficult, his response effectively turns just war theory into a road that leads to no destination but pacifism. If the theory has any validity, it must be valid despite such difficulties, which have always been with us. Despite such difficulties, Augustine seemed to believe that just wars had been fought. There are likely enough many other ways in which a tendency toward pacifism has crept into contemporary just war theory, Catholic and otherwise. The frustration Weigel and Johnson show over such attempts to use just war theory to prove the impossibility of a just war is understandable.

Cautionary Note: Distinguishing among ""Goods"" and ""Evils""

""The presumption against war has smuggled into just war thinking a pacifist premise — armed force is wicked — that classic just war thinking rejects,"" wrote Weigel in his debate with Anglican Archbishop Rowan Williams (Williams and Weigel, ""War and Statecraft: An Exchange,"" First Things, March 2004). Johnson writes ""Just war tradition has to do with the possible good use of force, not finding exceptional cases when it is possible to use something inherently evil (force) for the purposes of good"" (War to Oust, p. 36). Here it is useful to recall the way thinkers like Aquinas used these terms. For Aquinas, sin is an ""evil,"" and sickness is an ""evil"" (with sin being a greater evil). Existence itself is a ""good,"" so that a wicked person is ""good,"" at least to the extent that he exists (and if he has strength, intelligence, and charisma, those are also ""goods"" in themselves). In this sense, to the extent that war deprives human beings of life and limb, it involves ""evil"" and is not in itself ""good."" On the other hand, a war may be ""good"" in the sense that it is justly begun and waged in defense of the innocent. Yet to the extent that war deprives some persons of life, health, sanity, or liberty, it can be said to involve ""evil,"" since these things are good and generally humans are endowed with them. These meanings should not be confused. In these particular quotations from Weigel and Johnson, that confusion appears to exist. Those who approvingly use the phrase ""the presumption against war"" are often not saying it is always morally evil to go to war or use force (pacifists say that), but they are indeed implying (or stating) that war and force always involve the ""evils"" of depriving human beings of life or liberty. Just war theory is precisely about how to determine when it is morally good to use something that involves evil (the destruction of things that are in themselves good) in order that a greater good may come. If there were no ""evil"" involved in war, there would be no need for just war theory. (There is no ""just eating theory"" or ""just walking theory."")

The Ordinary Meaning of a ""Presumption against"" an Activity

Weigel and Johnson appear to be wrong about this phrase, for many reasons. First, in ordinary usage, and as the Catholic bishops and many others use it, the phrase ""presumption against war"" simply means that a government should not begin a war without very good reasons. A presumption against an activity simply means that it is not to be considered normal, natural, and freely permitted: it is instead permitted only under certain conditions, and those wishing to undertake them must justify them. Many activities are normal and everyday and need no particular justification; others are not, and must be carefully justified — concerning these latter, we can say there is a presumption against them. Take a few trivial examples: cracking one's knuckles is in the former category. There is no particular need to justify this act. The fact that it is not an appropriate thing to do when everyone else is silent during a church service or corporate meeting does not constitute a ""presumption against"" knuckle-cracking — it does not rise to that level. Slapping a stranger hard on the back, or grabbing him from behind and squeezing hard, are in the latter category. If the person is choking, one of these may be exactly the right thing to do. It is not that they should never be done, just that they should be done rarely, and with very good reasons, and never without such reasons.

Another, weightier example: there is a presumption against carrying concealed weapons in public in the laws of the United States. Permits may be obtained for this activity, with varying requirements. There is certainly a presumption against using such weapons against others: such use must be carefully justified, in terms of self-defense or defense of others. The culture and law of the United States do not say that backslapping strangers, or carrying concealed weapons, or use of concealed weapons by civilians, are evil in and of themselves. Not at all. Nonetheless, unlike knuckle-cracking and running hands through one's hair, they carry serious consequences, and must be justified. It is reasonable and natural to say that there is ""a presumption against"" them. The Catholic bishops and others appear in general to be simply saying that war is in this latter category. The ""presumption against war"" means simply that a government planning to go to war needs to have compelling reasons (although in a clear case of self-defense, the justice of repelling an attack under way is self-evident). It must share these reasons with its citizens and the world. This thought is not just fully compatible with classic just war theory, one might almost say that it is the essence of that theory.

Structure of the Theory in Accord with Presumption against War

Contrary to Johnson's claim, it is actually rather clear that the very structure of just war theory that Johnson and Weigel outline presupposes a presumption against war, understood in the normal sense of those words outlined above. If there were not a presumption against war, if making war were actually considered as normal as issuing drivers' licenses, to take Griffiths' example, then the whole theory would be set up the other way around. Just war theory sets up, in every case, restrictions on war: just cause, right intention, competent authority, reasonable chance of success, proportionality of ends, and last resort delineate circles within the conjunction of which war may justly be waged. Outside the area of overlap where all the conditions obtain, war is not permitted, it becomes sinful, unjust, or as Aquinas wrote, ""unlawful."" If there were no presumption, then just war theory would instead point out the narrow circumstances in which war would be wrong: unjust cause, wrong intention, lack of competent authority, and so forth. Outside those circumstances, the theory would say, make war at will. It would be like knuckle-cracking, permitted except in a narrowly defined set of circumstances.

Weigel notes that Aquinas places his discussion of just war within the treatise on charity (""caritas,"" divine love) in the Summa. (Weigel, Against the Grain, 209). Weigel's fundamental point seems to be that for Aquinas, a just war is an act of love by the ruler, in that he is defending his people from harm even at risk to himself (something that may be questionable for modern rulers). Nonetheless, it is inescapable that Aquinas, in that discussion of war, is carving out a very narrow set of circumstances within which war can be just, and outside which war is indeed sinful. As Williams put it in his exchange with Weigel, ""Formally, this is a consideration of those conditions under which what would otherwise be gravely sinful would not be so"" (""War and Statecraft,"" 15). The only just wars, for Aquinas, are those that fall where all three of his conditions hold, that is, where the restrictive circles in fact overlap.

This point is more clear when we look at the way Aquinas actually frames his argument on just war. The first ""question"" is ""whether it is always sinful to wage war?"" The question itself, given the restrictions that follow, strongly implies that it is often sinful to wage war. It is followed by four objections, which state the points of view that Aquinas intends to refute. All these ""objections"" are framed in absolute terms: ""it would seem that it is ""always sinful to wage war,"" ""war is always sinful,"" ""war is always a sin,"" and ""war is a sin in itself."" Each objection presents a biblical or logical reason for this conclusion. When Aquinas rejects these positions and states his own, in his ""On the contrary,"" he quotes Augustine to the effect that ""If the Christian religion forbade war altogether"" then John the Baptist would have counseled soldiers to give up soldiering — but he did not. In other words, the objectors claim war is always sinful, and Aquinas replies, in effect, ""no, not always — it is not altogether forbidden."" This is hardly a ringing endorsement of war.

Not only that, but consider again Weigel's point that Aquinas places his discussion of war within his treatise on charity. Weigel believes this is to show ""that rightly constituted authority is under a strict moral obligation to defend the security of those for whom it has assumed responsibility"" (Against the Grain, 209). But a look at the whole treatise on Charity in the Summa gives a different impression. First comes a discussion of charity itself, and then of the ""acts"" of charity, all very positive. Then comes a list of the vices opposed to charity: the ""questions"" in this section begin with the following titles: ""hatred, sloth, envy."" Next is a series of ""vices opposed to peace"" (as peace is the effect of charity): ""discord, contention, schism, war, strife, sedition, scandal"" (Summa II-II). The first article for each of these questions asks whether it is a sin, or a mortal sin, or a special sin, or always a sin, and the answer is always ""yes."" ""War"" is the exception, in that the question is whether it is ""always sinful,"" and the answer is, in effect, ""no, not always."" (Under sedition, Aquinas casually calls war a ""sin."" ""I answer that: sedition is a special sin, having something in common with war and strife, and differing somewhat from them. It has something in common with them, in so far as it implies a certain antagonism, and it differs from them in two points."" War in general for Aquinas is here just one more sin, unless it meets the exceptional requirements of a just war.) There is no evidence here for Weigel's contention about why ""war"" falls under ""charity."" In fact, war is generally caused by a lack of charity, just like the other vices in the list. That is why it is listed here, in line with Aquinas' usual practice throughout the Summa, listing and considering under a major heading not only the subsidiary virtues under the larger virtue, but the vices that are contrary to that virtue. Archbishop Williams is vindicated by the table of contents alone, as well as the details: war in general is ""gravely sinful:"" it is only when it meets the exceptional requirements of just war theory that it is just.

Aquinas' full answer (""I answer that . . ."") begins with restrictive conditions: ""In order for a war to be just, three things are necessary."" Clearly all three conditions must be met, according to Aquinas, and so any war that fails to meet even one of the three is unjust. (He explicitly states that a war may meet the first two requirements and be ""rendered unlawful"" through a ""wicked intention,"" violating the third.) Anyone who had read Weigel and Johnson before reading Aquinas might have expected a long preamble on the obligation of the sovereign to promote justice outside his borders, and the main question to be ""whether it is ever sinful to wage war."" Instead, a careful reading of Aquinas shows that he seems to live in much the same moral universe as the Catholic bishops.

Force, Sometimes Necessary, Violates Human Dignity

The reason the use of force in general on human beings is problematic, and that it may be used only when positively necessary and then carefully justified, is that freedom is the natural state of human beings. Use of lethal force is even more of a violation of human freedom and dignity, and has often irreversible consequences. Where is the dignity of human life if governments may casually take it, for weak reasons and with little or no explanation? As Williams wrote in his response to Weigel's essay ""Moral Clarity,"" (""War and Statecraft, 15), for Aquinas:

Violence is an external force compelling certain kinds of action; as such it is bound to appear as against nature or against justice. . . . The ruler who administers the law may use coercion for the sake of the common good in domestic policing and in international affairs. But such coercion will always need publicly available justification in terms of the common good, since otherwise it will appear as an arbitrary infringement of natural justice.

To reinforce that point, in another context Christopher West wrote ""persons — precisely because they are persons — are meant to be their own masters. Their dignity demands it. [Pope] John Paul [II] stresses that the person u2018surpasses all measures of appropriation and domination, of possession and gratification'"" (West, Theology of the Body Explained, 403). Simone Weil, in a work published in 1939 on the eve of war, ""defines force as u2018that x that turns anybody who is subjected to it into a thing,' either literally as a corpse or figuratively as a defeated foe begging for mercy or a slave."" (Quoted in Achilles in Iraq: The Poem of Force). It is a terrible act to turn a person into a thing, unless absolutely necessary. If compulsion of one human being by another (as in prison, for example) must be rare, and requires careful justification, how much more the taking of human life.

Usually, Justice Can Be Promoted without Force

It is important, in the context of the Weigel/Johnson thesis, to stress that most of the time, in fact, justice is promoted without force. Anyone who has lived in a reasonably happy family or a decent small town, or has studied or worked in a well-run school, knows that authorities are most often able to defend the peace of right order through implicit acceptance of their authority by those under it, an acceptance that is strengthened by parental instruction to children, peer pressure, civic rituals, exhortation, the work of individual consciences, and, most especially, the perception that their authority is in fact in the service of justice. The more this is so, the less is force necessary. Authority figures may have force available to them, but if things are going well, they can deal with problems without needing to resort to using it. (Even tyrannical authorities typically try to use these same factors (minus conscience and plus fear), rather than endless force, to gain obedience.) Force is available, under the right conditions, as a last resort. It is a last resort in part, of course, because (what Weigel and Johnson rarely if ever seem to mention) even the best governments can be carried away by power. ""Power tends to corrupt,"" as Lord Acton noted, and once we make the use of force into something expected and without the need to be explained, the use of force by government itself is more and more likely to be employed for unjust ends.

""Morally Neutral"" Is False Language for the Use of Force

A key consideration here is Johnson's claim that ""The classical tradition, by contrast, had thought of the use of force as morally neutral, good when . . . determined to be just."" Is this accurate? Consider a range of actions: going for a walk, taking a meal to a sick neighbor, sexual intercourse, cutting off someone's leg without anesthesia, and killing one's neighbor. Going for a walk is not generally considered to be on a high level of moral importance. Although it can be abused (someone might do it habitually to avoid responsibilities), walking is generally healthy but otherwise morally neutral. Taking a meal to a sick neighbor is almost always a good idea, although you could spoil it if your main purpose was to gloat over her sickness, or, in a bizarre but not inconceivable case, to figure out how to rob her later. There are greater consequences here, for good or evil, than in taking a walk. Sexual intercourse is a much more serious matter. For everyone with a system of morality, it is a morally important act with serious consequences, and serious restrictions (including at the least that it must always take place without coercion.) It can be either a great good, or a great evil, depending on the circumstances, but it would be quite strange for anyone (at least from the Christian or any classic tradition) to call sexual intercourse in general ""morally neutral.""

Cutting off someone's leg without anesthesia can be precisely the right, lawful thing to do, if you are with a group of soldiers under siege, with no hope of short-term rescue, the leg is gangrenous, and you have no anesthetics. It might be the right thing to do, and take a great deal of courage, but it would be agonizing to do, and the loss of a leg is always, in itself, a cause for sadness. In almost any other circumstance, cutting off a leg is a hideously evil act. Killing one's neighbor may result from legitimate self-defense, or defense of another, if he attempts rape or murder, but there will never be joy involved. It could be called ""good,"" but only in a rather technical sense: not good in itself, but good only as preventing a great evil.

The range of acts listed above runs from morally neutral to deeply morally consequential. War clearly falls at the latter end of this range, a long way from the category of taking a walk (neutral), or helping one's neighbor (usually good, but not deeply consequential in itself). War is sometimes permitted, and can be the right thing to do, but only rarely, and only under highly restricted circumstances, and it is never something that objectively should cause rejoicing. Loss of human life (much more than loss of one leg) is always, in itself, a cause for sadness (even a vicious killer has the potential, by grace, to become a good person), and the certain loss of many lives, much more so. If we found someone arguing that sexual intercourse should be seen as ""morally neutral,"" or that cutting off legs, or killing one's neighbor, needed to be seen as ""good when . . . determined to be just"" we would find that very argument a use of confusing and misleading language.

Support for this approach can be found in the Summa. Question 18 of the ""First Part of the Second Part,"" entitled ""The good and evil of human acts in general"" (Summa, I-II, 18, 2-4), makes it clear that for Aquinas, the good and evil of human actions is determined by their objects, and affected by circumstances as well. For a specific example, consider what Aquinas wrote about sexual intercourse: ""The conjugal act and adultery, as compared to reason, differ specifically and have effects specifically different; because the one deserves praise and reward, the other, blame and punishment"" (Summa, I-II, 18, 5, reply to objection 3). Consider Thomas' description of an action which is ""indifferent in its species"" (i.e. of good or evil): ""it may happen that the object of an action does not include something pertaining to the order of reason; for instance, to pick up a straw from the ground, to walk in the fields, and the like: and such actions are indifferent according to their species."" (Summa, I-II, 18, 8, ""I answer that""). Taking a walk or picking up a straw may be called ""morally neutral;"" but the use of force is either good or evil, depending on the aim and the circumstances. (As with several insights in this book, I am indebted to one of the tutors at Thomas Aquinas College for directing me to this section of the Summa.)

Classic Just War Writers Used Strong, Negative Language for War

Not only is this language of ""moral neutrality"" unfitting, it is emphatically not the language used by the classic just war thinkers. A few quotations from Augustine and Aquinas (especially significant due to the constant appeals to these two giants of the ""classic tradition"" in Weigel and Johnson's works) will make this clear. Begin with Augustine, whom Aquinas quotes continually in his article on war in the Summa. First, nowhere in those quotations does Augustine state that war itself, even just war, is or even can be ""good."" Johnson, in The War to Oust Saddam Hussein, quotes Augustine numerous times, and again nowhere in those quotations does Augustine say the use of armed force, or war, can be ""good"" — nor, in fact, that it is ""morally neutral."" It would be odd if he did, since in The City of God, Book 19, Chapter 5, Augustine writes ""On all hands we experience these slights, suspicions, quarrels, war, all of which are undoubted evils."" In Chapter 7, he laments,

but how many great wars, how much slaughter and bloodshed, have provided this unity [of the Roman Empire]! And though these are past, the end of these miseries has not yet come . . . But, say they, the wise man will wage just wars. As if he would not all the rather lament the necessity of just wars, if he remembers that he is a man; for if they were not just he would not wage them, and would therefore be delivered from all wars. . . . Let everyone, then, who thinks with pain on all these great evils, so horrible, so ruthless, acknowledge that this is misery. And if anyone either endures or thinks of them without mental pain, this is a more miserable plight still, for he thinks himself happy because he has lost human feeling.

All wars, then, for Augustine are ""undoubted evils"" and even just wars are ""miseries"" and ""great evils"" that no one with ""human feeling"" should think of ""without mental pain."" Much later, in Aquinas' article on war, when war meets the three, restrictive conditions he sets, he describes it not as ""good"" but as ""lawful."" Later still, Alphonsus de Liguori offered what is surely common sense wisdom when he wrote: ""There is no doubt that since war generally brings in its train so many evils and so much harm to religion, to innocent people, to the honor of women, etc., in practice it is hardly ever just if declared on probable reasons of justice alone and not certain reasons."" (De Quinto Praecepto Decalogi, quoted in Neo-Conned!, 226. I take ""certain"" here to mean ""reasonably certain,"" not ""absolutely certain"" for de Liguori. However, it here to mean ""reasonably certain,"" but it must mean at least ""beyond reasonable doubt."")

From an author often acknowledged as one of the great neo-Scholastics, Suarez: ""Jus belli est odiosum, et poena ejus gravissima; ergo restringenda est quod fieri potest."" ""The right of war is hateful, and its punishment is most grave; therefore it is to be restricted as far as can be."" (Francisco Suarez, S.J., De Caritate, XIII, 7, 4 (quoted in Neo-Conned!, page preceding dedication). To cite an analogous concept from Islam: within Islam divorce is permitted, but it is explicitly called ""akrah al-masmoohat,"" ""the most hated of the permitted things."" In Islamic thinking, in other words, God himself hates divorce, but permits it. The concept illustrates how even just war seems to be viewed in the actual writings of classic just war thought — while unjust war is, of course, viewed with complete horror in this tradition. These kinds of frank acknowledgments of the certain miseries of war — slaughter, bloodshed, misery, harm, dishonor — are, doubtless, a part of the ""distinctive moral texture"" (Against the Grain, 209) of warfare in classic just war theory, even if they are generally quite hard to find in the writings of Weigel and Johnson.

Up to this point, the positive argument has been made that the phrase ""presumption against war"" can be and most naturally should be understood as well within the bounds of classic just war theory. There are more specific logical errors in the Weigel/Johnson campaign against ""the presumption,"" and the overall negative consequences that result from their push in the opposite direction.

Lost Distinction: ""Presumption against"" Vs. ""Prohibition Of""

It seems Weigel and Johnson have muddied the distinction between ""presumption against"" and ""prohibition of."" Possibly as a result of this, important errors have crept into their own statements about presumptions. This appears to begin with Johnson's statement above that ""The presumption against war idea provided a middle ground [for Catholics] on which those who favored a just war approach and the pacifists could come together: both shared that presumption."" Not so: pacifists believe in a prohibition of war rather than a ""presumption against"" it. The ""presumptions"" against force, violence, and war are not shared with pacifists. It is true that strict just war theorists and pacifists may end up in practice in a similar position: opposing some wars. It is this that is the middle ground, not ""the presumption"" (and there is nothing inherently wrong with seeking and finding such a political middle ground: real politics is packed with such alliances). Another example of this muddying is found in Johnson's quotation above where he writes that ""in classic just war thought . . . the assumption was not u2018against war' but against the evil and injustice that unfortunately abound in the affairs of men and nations, which armed force may be required to remedy."" This is serious confusion: war in just war theory is a grave undertaking, with important moral consequences, that is permitted under conditions. ""Evil and injustice,"" on the other hand, are never permitted under any circumstances. Thus there is neither an ""assumption"" nor a ""presumption"" against evil and injustice, but an absolute prohibition against taking part in them. The parallel is false. Weigel falls into the same error when he writes, in ""Just War: An Exchange,"" (p. 34) that ""[j]ust war thinking starts with u2018a presumption for justice,' not a u2018presumption against violence.'"" These too are false parallels. It is a government's duty to avoid doing injustice in all situations, even, as Weigel notes in another context, when the cost to the rulers is high. It is not its duty, according to just war theory, to avoid violence in all situations. In addition, as noted above, there is often no need to set the pursuit of justice in opposition to the avoidance of violence, because in most cases justice can and should be pursued without the use of force.

Red Herring: A ""Priority"" without Consequences

In his ""exchange"" in First Things with Williams, Weigel never directly addressed the Archbishop's point concerning Aquinas' article on war that: ""Formally, this is a consideration of those conditions under which what would otherwise be gravely sinful would not be so"" (War and Statecraft, 15). Weigel asks, ""Why can a sovereign ruler override what Dr. Williams calls Aquinas' u2018prima facie case against war,'"" thus quietly allowing that Aquinas makes such a case (if not, it would be meaningless for Weigel to say it can be overridden). Weigel insists, though, as if the point contradicts that ""prima facie case,"" that rulers have ""a prior moral obligation, a responsibility to defend the peace of right order. That prior obligation is the beginning of all morally serious thinking about the use of armed force for morally serious ends.""

The ""priority"" of the obligation should be analyzed. In looking at the work of government from any non-anarchist and non-libertarian theoretical standpoint, it is necessary at some point to posit the duty of the government to establish a just and peaceful order, at least within the borders the government controls. In a consideration of the work of government, this duty is likely enough to come prior to considering the issue of war. However, just war theorists (as opposed, generally, to pacifists and anarchists) believe in a government that is authorized to use force at least some of the time. That is true even of openly ""presumption against war"" just war theorists. Therefore, the issue Weigel is so concerned about here is simply a given for the majority of Weigel's non-pacifist opponents. The reason they do not hammer away at the issue is not that they do not believe it; rather, it is because it is so fundamental to their beliefs that it does not cross their minds to raise it.

But does prior acknowledgment of this moral obligation actually makes a difference? Let someone begin by positing that a government has an obligation to establish ""the peace of order,"" using force when necessary, at least within its own borders. It seems certain that Williams agrees with such a statement — the Church of England does not pick anarchists to be Archbishops of Canterbury. Next, the question arises: when may the same sovereign make war outside his borders? We have now ""begun"" in the right place, according to Weigel, we have got our priorities right, yet — the question is just as difficult as if we had not done so. Why? Because there is almost always another government there, with rights and responsibilities, one would think, within its borders. When is it right, therefore, for a government to use force beyond its own borders to promote peace (however defined) against the will of another government, especially if the first government's country is not under any visible or demonstrable attack? How are all the conflicting claims of sovereign authorities to be reconciled? Weigel gives no direct answer to these questions in his answer to Williams. It seems that using Weigel's prescribed starting point simply doesn't help at all in resolving the nitty-gritty question of when a war is actually just or unjust.

Consider a parallel case, the presumption of innocence in court. The presumption of innocence in law is in practice a presumption against a jury's believing the prosecution (i.e. the government), until it proves guilt beyond reasonable doubt. This presumption may be looked at both in terms of where it falls in a theory of criminal justice, and in terms of whether it prevents or discourages prosecutions. There would be little point in debating where thinking about criminal justice ought to begin, as somewhere in the theory government is said to be in the business of enforcing the laws. Somewhere else along the way, at least in the Anglo-Saxon tradition, juries are said to be under a duty to assume the innocence of the accused until their guilt is demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt. Although the duty of government may be logically prior to the presumption of innocence, the presumption of innocence already assumes that government is at work enforcing the laws. What difference does it make whether this assumption about the government enforcing its laws is made explicit or not? In practical terms, hundreds of years of the presumption of innocence in Anglo-Saxon law have not prevented governments from prosecuting criminals, nor from winning convictions against them (including, sometimes, the innocent — it is worth not forgetting that). It seems clear that the order of considering these two facts within the theory makes no practical difference, and beginning with the presumption of innocence would in practice make no difference in the fact of prosecutions and convictions. (Perhaps, though, if there were an effort to try to drown out talk of the presumption of innocence due to a perceived ""conflict"" between that and the obligation of governments to enforce the laws, it might erode the presumption of innocence — not to the benefit of citizens, since that presumption is vital precisely because governments too can be immoral, and power corrupts.)

And what is the effect of this presumption against believing the government, when a prosecution is successful and the jury finds against the defendant? In fact, because of the existence of this presumption, citizens are more sure the jury did rightly — it did not lightly decide to deprive the defendant of money, liberty, or life, but only after it overcame the presumption of the defendant's innocence. This negative presumption actually strengthens our confidence in the rightness of the action the government wished to take, without in any way making convictions impossible. (I am [again] indebted to my friend, Thomas Aquinas College tutor John Nieto, for this observation.) There is no reason for a ""presumption against war"" not to have the same effect.

Not Seeing That Standards Cut Both Ways

Weigel wrote against Williams, a few sentences after his remarks on the ""prior obligation"" of the sovereign, that the ""presumption against war"" has not reinforced the ""obvious"" truth that ""public authority has to make a moral case that the use of armed force in defending the peace of right order is the only reasonable option in this instance, because other nonmilitary means have failed or have been reasonably judged to be unavailing, given the threat and the aggressor."" On the contrary, surely by its nature it reinforces that very truth, to the extent that people think about it, and many did before the Iraq war. The government ""has to make"" the moral case for war, precisely because other ""public authorities"" have a presumptive right not to be attacked, and because, as Williams notes, war is ""gravely sinful"" if fought for the wrong reasons: war is ""presumed to be unjust"" until convincingly demonstrated to be otherwise (and ugly, as Augustine notes, even when it is the right thing to do). That is precisely why Aquinas wrote that war is only just when it meets certain conditions, and why governments strive to show that they have met those conditions. Weigel appears to ignore the possibility that some of those opposing the war did so not out of pacifism but precisely because they did not believe the public authority had convincingly made ""a moral case that the use of armed force . . . is the only reasonable option in this instance, because other nonmilitary means have failed or have been reasonably judged to be unavailing,"" and because they judged the evidence about ""the threat and the aggressor"" insufficient. It appears that Weigel nowhere in that essay accounted for this possibility, but in fact, many opponents of the war were obviously not pacifists. Many opponents of the war, whether pacifists or not, in fact made many of their arguments against the war in precisely these terms: they argued, with evidence, that ""public authority"" had failed to ""make a moral case"" in favor of the war. Like Johnson at times, Weigel appears in this passage unable to see that a standard, by its very nature, can cut both ways. In this case, if a standard shows when a war is just, it can also, by definition, show that a war is unjust.

False Analogies and a Missed One: JWT and Force in General

Looking carefully at Weigel's spanking example at the beginning of this appendix, and his use of Griffiths' driving license example, one finds serious problems, as well as a missed chance to broaden the application of the theory. There is not a presumption against spanking — but that is because the word ""spanking"" itself already includes the idea of a controlled and proper use of force (rather like ""just war""). There is, of course, a presumption against the use of force against children, which is nicely parallel to just war theory: the use of force against children should not be a normal, unrestricted activity. It should be used only for a right cause, with the right intention (for the child's good, not to satisfy parental fury), it should be practiced by the competent authority (the parent, or a designated guardian, or, in an emergency, a competent adult), it should be proportionate to the disobedient act, and it should be a last resort, not used if a lesser sanction, such as a stern warning, will be sufficient. (Reasonable chance of success is more or less a given, or perhaps this is why sixteen-year old boys are rarely spanked.) In this analogy, the pacifist would be the ""never spank"" parent, and the ""war is normal"" theorist the casually violent parent who smacks or cuffs a child without warning and for any reason. The word ""war"" is properly parallel to ""force,"" not ""spanking."" (To make parallel concepts of war and spanking is an ugly idea, in part because a proper spanking almost never causes lasting physical damage at least, whereas even the best-justified war involves death, chaos that allows ugly violence free rein, and destruction.) Weigel's humorous little spanking parable actually reinforces Griffith's point.

While Weigel is right that Griffiths' example of licensing drivers is a strange use of language, that is because issuing driving licenses is a natural, everyday activity, with very minor restrictions. There is a range of human activities — as noted above, some (like knuckle-cracking or taking a walk) come with a very few, very minor restrictions or none, while others come with heavy, serious restrictions. To use ""presumption against"" language when there are few, minor restrictions is an odd use of language, because we usually restrict such language to activities with serious possible consequences. But when Weigel accepts Griffiths' licensing analogy while denying that there is a ""presumption against"" issuing licenses, he implicitly accepts a parallel between making war and issuing drivers' licenses, with a presumption against neither. That parallel would make war an everyday, normal occurrence — an activity that every ""sovereign authority"" should practice as often as his heart desires, a tool of statecraft as unexceptional as sending ambassadors or organizing cultural exchanges. To make war equivalent to issuing licenses in explicit terms would be horrifying, but that is the direction in which Weigel's language pushes him. The whole parallel expresses an overreaction in theory that, in rhetoric at least, has lost touch with the underlying reality.

Weigel misses a much better analogy than that of spanking and war. First, one can one in fact say there is a healthy presumption (understood in the normal, natural sense) against the use of force against any human being, whether by the forces of order or by other citizens — force should only be used under certain highly restrictive conditions. It is not normal to use force against human beings, but at times it may or should be done. However, if we ask when it is permissible to use force, just war theory offers an excellent analogy to other situations. One more example: the police. When do we as citizens want to see the police use force? Well, for a just cause, with a right intention, when they have the proper authority under law (just because they are the police does not prove they are enforcing the law in a particular instance), when the ends are proportionate to the means, when there is a reasonable chance of success, and as a last resort. The parallel with just war theory is excellent. Perhaps Weigel missed it because he has come to think of war as normal and unexceptional, something quite alien to the thought of Aquinas.

Confusion on Private Use of Force

Weigel also claims that the ""presumption against violence"" ""collapses bellum into duellum,"" or ""conflates the ideas of violence and war."" For Weigel, ""duellum"" signifies ""the use of armed force for private ends by private individuals:""

If the just war tradition is a theory of statecraft, to reduce it to a casuistry of means-tests that begins with a ""presumption against war"" is to begin at the wrong place. The just war tradition begins somewhere else. It begins by defining the moral responsibilities of governments, continues with the definition of morally appropriate political ends, and only then takes up the question of means. By reversing the analysis of means and ends, the ""presumption against war"" starting point collapses bellum into duellum and ends up conflating the ideas of ""violence"" and ""war."" The net result is that warfare is stripped of its distinctive moral texture. Indeed, among many American religious leaders today, the very notion of warfare as having a ""moral texture"" seems to have been forgotten (Against the Grain, 209).

In fact, Weigel appears to collapse the private use of force into violence, and to have the wrong idea of what makes the use of force moral. Say a stranger rushes at my wife in the street, red-faced and shouting. I interpose myself, and, when the man tries to shove me out of the way, I wrestle him to the ground. This is private use of force, with no sanction by the state at all, and for a private end — the defense of my wife. Yet, is it immoral? Surely not. Surely it would be fully justified and moral. It is not, as Weigel appears to imply, that government use of force is good and private use is not — that is simply confusion. Instead, there are moral and immoral uses of force, both for individuals and for governments. In both cases, there is a ""presumption against violence."" If the same stranger, instead of rushing at my wife, shouted at her from across the street, ""I hate you! Watch out, you're going to get it,"" would I be justified in crossing the street and pummeling him, with fists or some weapon, or shooting him if I had a pistol with me? No, but not primarily because it would be a private use of force, rather because the presumption against violence rules it out. While the words are hostile, there appears to be no imminent danger. The ideas of ""last resort"" and ""proportionality"" interpose themselves as well, just as they should for a government in an analogous situation. It is not the private use of force that is ruled out, but the use of force that is not in accord with justice and prudence.

It is true that in Augustinian and Thomist thought, a soldier is justified, during a just war, in seeking to kill enemy soldiers because of the command of a right authority, whereas the private person, for Aquinas, is justified in killing even in self-defense only by ""double-effect"" reasoning — he aims to defend himself, rather than to kill, even if the proportionate defensive action he takes does in fact kill his attacker. Nonetheless, even this permission to aim to kill in warfare does not grant blanket permission to kill enemy soldiers. For example, a slaughter of enemy soldiers who have laid down their arms and surrendered is most definitely not a moral act according to just war theory, whatever the orders of superiors may be. There is no blanket permission in just war theory to use force in warfare, even in a just war, any more than in private life. For the state and for the individual, the use of force must be justified.

When Weigel refers to ""the distinctive moral texture of warfare"" in this context, perhaps he is unconsciously guilty of government-worship. Warfare has the same ""moral texture"" (in one sense of the term) as any human activity: if in accord with prudence and justice, it is moral; if not, it is immoral. Warfare is different from the private use of force not because one is moral and the other immoral, but because warfare is a corporate activity, subject to different rules from those that govern private action, even if those rules are based on the same underlying principles. But what is truly distinctive about the moral texture of warfare, as opposed to other corporate activities, it is precisely its hatefulness even when right, an idea strongly supported by the writings of Augustine, Alphonsus de Liguori, and Suarez, as well as the list in which Aquinas places ""war.""

Getting the Practical Consequences of ""the Presumption"" Wrong

A counterexample to Weigel and Johnson's claims the phrase ""the presumption against war,"" or the concept as an introduction to just war theory, leads by some powerful inner logic to pacifist conclusions is found in the Bishops' letter ""The Challenge of Peace"" itself, the very document that seems to Johnson to lead in the wrong direction. In the first instance where the phrase is used in that document, the full paragraph (70) runs thus:

As we have already noted, however, the protection of human rights and the preservation of peace are tasks to be accomplished in a world marked by sin and conflict of various kinds. The Church's teaching on war and peace establishes a strong presumption against war which is binding on all; it then examines when this presumption may be overridden, precisely in the name of preserving the kind of peace which protects human dignity and human rights.

First, the bishops state that the over-riding concern is the ""protection of human rights and the preservation of peace."" Peace is defined in a variety of ways over the preceding sixty-nine paragraphs, but is expressly stated not to be merely ""the absence of war"" (see paragraph 68). The bishops then state that there is a presumption against war, and immediately that it may indeed be overridden (in other words, to be crystal clear, the bishops are stating here when wars may rightly be begun), precisely to preserve a peace that is not just the absence of war, as Johnson wrongly complained of their description, but a peace ""which protects human dignity and human rights.""

In fact, it appears quite inaccurate to say, as Johnson does, that ""The Challenge of Peace described Catholic just war doctrine as beginning with a general u2018presumption against war.'"" It would be more accurate to say that ""The Challenge of Peace"" begins its discussion of war with a long, multi-faceted discussion of peace, including the idea of justice, and then moves on to just war theory only after that context has been established. In fact, the sixty-nine paragraphs that precede that mention of a ""presumption against war"" are largely about the deeper meaning of ""peace,"" in all its complexities, including the requirement of right order, or justice. In one of the first attempts to define ""peace"" in biblical terms the document states, ""true peace implied a restoration of the right order not just among peoples, but within all of creation"" (paragraph 32). Soon after, it states: ""The lament of Isaiah 48:18 makes clear the connection between justice, fidelity to God's law, and peace"" (paragraph 35). And, in paragraph 68 (with slight repetition):

Peace is not merely the absence of war. Nor can it be reduced solely to the maintenance of a balance of power between enemies. Nor is it brought about by dictatorship. Instead, it is richly and appropriately called ""an enterprise of justice"" (Is. 32:17). Peace results from that harmony built into human society by its divine founder and actualized by men as they thirst after ever greater justice.

It is indeed possible to move directly from a ""presumption against war"" to a discussion of how and when to go to war in response to grave injustice, and that is explicitly stated by the very document Johnson and Weigel single out as exemplifying the trend toward pacifism. Note that, despite Johnson's dark suspicions about ""why the aim of peace was left out of the just war jus ad bellum as stated by The Challenge of Peace,"" Weigel himself left that aim out of his own short list of jus ad bellum criteria in ""Moral Clarity in a Time of War"" (Against the Grain, 210). The likeliest explanation in both cases is simply that the ""aim of peace"" falls rather naturally under ""right intention,"" as Johnson himself notes in his January 2005 essay (""Just War, as It Was and Is,"" 20), as well as in his book The War to Oust Saddam Hussein — and Aquinas discusses the aim of peace under right intention as well.

Conclusion on ""the Presumption""

""The presumption against war has smuggled into just war thinking a pacifist premise — armed force is wicked — that classic just war thinking rejects,"" writes Weigel contra Williams. Not at all — the ""presumption against war"" is simply a restatement in new terms of the classic position. Classic just war theory allows war under limited conditions, but shows a strong and well-justified distaste for war, which is gravely sinful if it does not meet the conditions. Classic just war theory does not ""begin"" with a broad, general obligation of all rulers to stop evil everywhere (see section below on ""The Sovereign's u2018Obligation'"") because such an obligation would not solve precisely the problem that (except in a purely and clearly defensive war) needs solving: when is the lack of rightly-ordered peace in the other state so great that war is justified? ""The presumption"" does not presume that ""armed force is wicked,"" as Weigel claims, but rather that the use of armed force conflicts with what is normally good — liberty, and that its full-blown use kills humans — which is tragic. Weigel's logical fallacy here is the ""excluded middle."" Either you believe force is inherently ""wicked,"" or you regard it as completely normal and ""neutral."" The truth is in the middle — war is often wicked, and when it is lawful, it is still regrettable. If pacifism has been smuggled into the classic just war tradition (and regrettably, that is often true), there is no reason to blame it on ""the presumption.""

On the one hand, the attempt to show that just war theory has been weighted toward pacifism is a perfectly legitimate one — the case can easily be made. However, the overreaction by Weigel and Johnson in their long fight against ""the presumption against war"" basically tips the just war theory boat over on the other side, toward a ""presumption in favor of war."" It does this first in the very denial of the concept of a presumption against war, because if there is no presumption against some activity, that activity has to be considered normal, natural, and always acceptable, like issuing a driving license, picking a straw off the ground, or taking a walk. It is doubtful that classic just war theory ever described war in such terms. Secondly, it harms just war theory by an overwhelming use of positive language about war, with only token remarks about its negative certainties.

Weigel even writes in one essay, ""Thus, in the just war tradition, war is not an abandonment of the moral realm; war is a moral category–war is the use of proportionate and discriminate armed force by the legitimate public authority in order to secure certain worthy public goods. Anything else is brigandage, in one form or another."" (Against the Grain, 232-33. Unfortunately, this statement is not taken out of context. There is nothing in the immediate surrounding text about the possibility of an unjust war. It is true that Weigel elsewhere discusses unjust wars, but to write statements like the one quoted appears to demonstrate a serious loss of balance. Coupled with his assertion that Aquinas article is on ""iustum bellum,"" rather than ""bellum,"" it strongly implies a presumption in favor of the justice of war in Weigel's thinking. Aquinas' writings carry no such presumption.) Yet if it were true that ""war"" in the just war tradition is ""the use of proportionate and discriminate armed force by the legitimate public authority in order to secure certain worthy public goods,"" there would have been no need for Augustine and Aquinas to write of ""just"" and ""unjust"" wars, nor for Aquinas to put ""war"" in the middle of his list of uncharitable acts. In Weigel's definition here, all wars are just, and only ""brigandage"" is unjust.

In a similar vein, Johnson writes ""Just war tradition has to do with the possible good use of force, not finding exceptional cases when it is possible to use something inherently evil (force) for the purposes of good"" (War to Oust, 36).

While this is partially correct, it is also sharply misleading, like saying the building code ""has to do with defining when a building is safe,"" or that the speed limit ""has to do with the possible good uses of speed."" Just war theory is not a guide for praising rulers who start wars any more than it is a grab-bag of all-purpose condemnations of the use of force. It is a set of standards: it consists of criteria. According to one on-line definition, a criterion is ""a standard of judgment or criticism; a rule or principle for evaluating or testing something."" It comes from a Greek root meaning to separate, or decide. Moral criteria, by definition, do not exist for the purpose of showing merely what is good and acceptable. By their existence, such criteria unavoidably show also what is evil or unacceptable.

In conclusion, it is not only possible to make a ""just war"" case for war after starting at the ""presumption against war,"" it is a perfectly good place to start, because war is simply not an everyday activity, nor is it desirable except in carefully delimited circumstances. This is both explicitly and implicitly acknowledged by Augustine, Aquinas, and others in the classic tradition, and is clear enough in the very framework, the six classic criteria, that Weigel and Johnson use. Unless it is abused in some way, the neutral, descriptive phrase ""the presumption against war"" falls well within classic just war theory. Creeping pacifism should be fought on other grounds.

Prudence, the Morality of Human Action, and Aquinas

Downgrading the Prudential Criteria

Johnson expresses some reservations about the three ""prudential"" criteria (although he follows up immediately with the statement that the prudential criteria ""are clearly important concerns""):

I have also criticized the priority given in some recent just war thinking to three moral criteria not found in classic statements of the just war idea. My concern with these is not simply that they are new, but that they are at best supportive concerns having to do with the wise practice of government, not primary concerns having to do with establishing and protecting the goods of politics themselves. To treat them as if they are of the same character as the requirements found in classic just war thought, or even as more important, warps just war reasoning. The traditional just war criteria — sovereign authority, just cause, and right intention, including the end of peace — are deontological in character; they impose duties on the person or people having ultimate moral responsibility for the good of the political community and for good relations among political communities. The newly added criteria . . . are consequentialist in nature, requiring an estimate of outcomes and a weighing of the wisdom of resorting to force in a given case (War to Oust, 36).

Johnson restates this caution against treating the prudential criteria as equal to the others in a number of places. Weigel goes further in his downgrading: after denouncing what he perceives as too much emphasis on the prudential criteria, he drops them almost completely from the discussion in his April 2005 article, despite its sweeping title, ""Iraq: Then & Now.""

While Johnson's division between deontological and prudential criteria is an acceptable one, it appears that Johnson and Weigel make far too much of it. Note, first, what appears to be an ambiguity in Johnson's formulation. When he writes that ""The traditional just war criteria . . . are deontological in character; they impose duties"" on political leaders, it is not clear from reading Johnson that sometimes the duty imposed is that of not going to war. A binding obligation generally binds both ways: the wedding vow commits a husband both positively, to love his wife, and negatively, not to have affairs with other women. The criterion ""just cause,"" for example, binds a nation to seek justice for its citizens and, to some extent, those of other nations (sometimes, but not often, through war). Considered by itself, this criterion cannot possibly bind a nation to go to war, otherwise the remaining criteria would be superfluous. But this criterion, by itself, clearly binds a nation not to go to war without a just cause. It is not clear that Johnson has demonstrated that there is a duty to go to war even when all six criteria have been met — might there not be a case in which some of the prudential criteria, while judged to be met, were not overwhelmingly met? If the proportionality of ends criterion, for example, had led only to a weak judgment that the damage from a war was likely to be less than the evil to be halted, or if the chance of achieving success were judged likely but not extremely likely, has Johnson clearly shown the duty of country A to wage war on the behalf of the people of country B?

Secondly, just as the prudential criteria require ""an estimate of outcomes"" and a ""weighing of wisdom,"" so the deontological criteria require ""estimates"" and ""weighings"" of justice, intentions, and legality. No one, statesmen included, (they are, after all, politicians) perceives the force of the law, justice, and the rightness of his own and his nation's intentions with the simplicity of someone perceiving the color of a leaf or measuring the length of a two-by-four. There are difficulties in perception here as much as in the prudential criteria, and motives intrude just as much. Aquinas himself makes this clear (see below).

Later in The War to Oust Saddam Hussein, Johnson criticizes a Jimmy Carter editorial for (among other things) getting the criteria out of order, and for putting a prudential criterion, last resort, first. In his critique of Carter's editorial, Johnson says these criteria ""have to do with the wisdom of doing what has already been determined to be justified. That is, they are about whether it is worth the risk to do what we know is right. This is a question that should be asked, but it is not the first or most important question to ask"" (War to Oust, 59).

The first problem with Johnson's analysis here is that in effect he completely divorces the deontological from the prudential criteria, assigning all the moral weight to the first set, and going further to say the prudential criteria provide a mere risk calculation. Johnson's recommended sequence of considering the criteria appears to be one of the most logical ones, but even if we follow it we have not established the right and wrong of the matter until we are done with all the criteria. For example, the present or future rulers of China might, perhaps, be shown to be as despotic and as guilty of crimes against their ""own people"" as Saddam ever was, and a calculation made of whether the United States should ""oust"" them. The questions of sovereign authority, just cause, and right intention, including the U.S. purpose of ""restoring peace,"" might be settled. Perhaps a future U.S. administration could show that it could neutralize China's nuclear arsenal, probably with preemptive nuclear strikes (to reach hardened underground missile silos). Would that establish the rightness of a war with the Chinese leadership? Wouldn't some other questions need to be examined before the plan was pronounced ""right?"" For example: the questions of how many millions of Chinese civilians (as well as soldiers) might die in the conflict, how those millions of deaths compared to the damage done by the leadership, what practical hope of a better government after such a nuclear strike and subsequent war existed, and whether any other means of producing positive change were possible? Johnson's assigning of the entire moral weight to the first group of criteria and none to the second seems impossible to defend. The evaluation of the second prudential group of criteria in every case forms an integral part of the total justice or lack thereof of a decision to go to war.

Prudential Criteria Form a Useful Shortcut to Evaluation

But that suggests another consideration: the fact that the prudential criteria must be met in order for a war to be just provides a useful short cut. If it is quite clear that one or more of the prudential criteria is in a given situation impossible to meet, why waste time considering the justice of a proposed war in the abstract, except as an intellectual exercise? The example of China above illustrates very well the value of this short cut: no sensible writer would bother to discuss the justice of such a war, because it is clear the costs would be so horrific, and the outcome so uncertain, that the overall justice of the idea is not even worth considering. On a smaller scale, the same is true of North Korea: even without nuclear weapons, the devastation the North, with its well-buried artillery, could wreak on the South is so huge that only a clearly imminent and devastating planned attack by the North could make a first strike (even a non-nuclear one) on the North just, despite the truly odious character of the North's regime. There appear to be no serious calls by anyone for waging preemptive or preventive war on North Korea, presumably because of this rather simple calculation.

For Aquinas, Justice without Prudence Is Inconceivable

In this connection, note also the classical listing of the ""cardinal virtues,"" which include both justice and prudence. Plato lists them, (in The Republic), and the Biblical book of Wisdom (which remains part of Catholic bibles) does also: ""virtues . . . temperance and prudence, justice and fortitude"" (Wisdom 8:7, New Jerusalem Bible). Justice is not first in that list. When Aquinas lists the moral virtues, he rearranges them, putting not justice but prudence in the first place (Summa, I-II. 61, 2. It is true that Aquinas sees justice as ""foremost among all the moral virtues,"" Summa, I-II. 58, 12, and the importance of justice among the virtues for Aquinas can hardly be overstated, but this does not indicate that it can stand alone.) In an earlier article, Aquinas indicates why he does so:

Gregory says . . . ""the other virtues, unless we do prudently what we desire to do, cannot be real virtues."" . . . Moral virtue cannot be without prudence, because it is a habit of choosing, i.e. making us choose well. Now in order that a choice be good, two things are required. First, that the intention be directed to a due end. . . . Secondly, that a man take rightly those things which have reference to the end: and this he cannot do unless his reason counsel, judge, and command aright, which is the function of prudence and the virtues annexed to it.) (Summa, I-II. 58, 4.)

It seems rather clear from these statements that Aquinas would regard justice without prudence not as something incomplete, but as something impossible. For Aquinas, without prudence it is impossible to ""choose well,"" even in the seeking of justice. This reinforces the earlier point that justice must be weighed and argued rather than directly perceived, and that rulers and moralists are just as liable to error in this endeavor as in the ""estimation of outcomes"" involved in applying the prudential criteria. Aquinas' and Gregory's point in this paragraph could be rephrased in terms of war: the justice a nation seeks to achieve in war can be neither chosen nor achieved without prudence.

But there is more to be said about Aquinas' views on justice and prudence. Aquinas' brief article on war is an integral part of his vast Summa, and the context in which he placed this one small piece of his work offers rich insights. The article on war comes in the third main division of the Summa. In the second part of that work, Aquinas has a great deal to say about right and wrong and human actions. Question 18, ""the good and evil of human acts, in general,"" is key here. In the early parts of that ""question,"" Aquinas asserts, contrary to what might be expected, that the goodness of a moral action is not a mere question of abstract definition, but is related to the object of the action: ""the primary goodness of a moral action is derived from its suitable object . . . an action is said to be good from the fact that it can produce a good effect. Consequently the very proportion of an action to its effect is the measure of its goodness."" (Summa, I-II, 18, 2). Aquinas then goes further, and ascribes a key role to the circumstances around an act: ""On the contrary, the Philosopher [Aristotle] says (Ethic. ii, 3) that a virtuous man acts as he should, and when he should, and so on in respect of the other circumstances. . . . Therefore human actions are good or evil according to circumstances."" (Summa, I-II, 18, 3). This leads to a summation in the fourth article of this ""Question:""

Accordingly a fourfold goodness may be considered in a human action. First, that which, as an action, it derives from its genus; because as much as it has of action and being so much has it of goodness, as stated above (Article 1). Secondly, it has goodness according to its species; which is derived from its suitable object. Thirdly, it has goodness from its circumstances, in respect, as it were, of its accidents. Fourthly, it has goodness from its end, to which it is compared as to the cause of its goodness (Summa, I-II, 18, 4).

How does a good or just war fit in here? The first kind of goodness is the elementary goodness of being a complete action — the goodness of existence, not really what our era would call a part of moral goodness. The second derives from the object, and here we deal with ""just cause."" The third kind of goodness derives from circumstances, and here ""prudence"" is vital, along with the prudential criteria. Perhaps sovereign authority, or questions of legality, come under this heading as well. The fourth kind of goodness is from its end, or object, and this is most closely associated with right intention, or the aim of peace.

Later in this second main division of the Summa, Aquinas deals with prudence as one of the intellectual virtues. He asserts that prudence, the virtue of knowing how to achieve good aims,

is most necessary for human life. For a good life consists in good deeds. Now in order to do good deeds, it matters not only what a man does, but also how he does it; to wit that he do it from right choice, and not merely from an impulse or passion. And since choice is about things in reference to the end, rectitude of choice requires two things; namely, the due end, and something suitably ordained to that end [i.e. the means] (Summa, I-II, 57, 5).

Looking at these remarks, which all precede the article on war, it is clear that for Aquinas no action can be good unless it meets prudential criteria as well as deontological ones, to use Johnson's terms. For Aquinas, the right choice necessary to do any good deed, including choosing and embarking on a just war, requires suitable means, chosen through reason so that they actually lead to the aimed-for result in a given situation.

As discussed in Chapter 7, the concept of ""right intention"" for Aquinas is firmly tied to the idea of an ""end,"" and this again links the prudential criteria to the others. Aquinas does not use the term ""right intention"" in a feel-good, fuzzy way, such that anyone who claimed it got credit. While Aquinas' article on war deals entirely with the core question of right and wrong, without mentioning any prudential considerations, it is nonetheless situated in the middle of the Summa. Given that context, it is inconceivable that Aquinas would have believed that a decision to go to war could be morally right without satisfying prudential requirements.

A Thomist Case for Each Prudential Criterion

Going further, a strong case can be made for each of the prudential criteria from specific statements by Aquinas in other contexts. First, proportionality, perhaps the clearest. Consider Aquinas' view of a similar subject to war, the overthrow of a tyrant, expressed in his article ""Sedition"" (Summa, II-II.42, 2). He wrote: ""There is no sedition in disturbing a [tyrannical] government . . . unless indeed the tyrant's rule be disturbed so inordinately, that his subjects suffer greater harm from the consequent disturbance than from the tyrant's government."" The point is reinforced in the article on killing in self-defense: ""And yet, though proceeding from a good intention, an act may be rendered unlawful, if it be out of proportion to the end"" (Summa, II-II.64, 7).

Next, last resort. In Aquinas' discussion of killing in self-defense, he offers a limited defense of such killing, on the basis that the intention is self-preservation, and with the strict qualification that the violence is necessary for self-defense:

Accordingly the act of self-defense may have two effects, one is the saving of one's life, the other is the slaying of the aggressor. Therefore this act, since one's intention is to save one's own life, is not unlawful, seeing that it is natural to everything to keep itself in ""being,"" as far as possible. And yet, though proceeding from a good intention, an act may be rendered unlawful, if it be out of proportion to the end. Wherefore if a man, in self-defense, uses more than necessary violence, it will be unlawful: whereas if he repel force with moderation his defense will be lawful (Summa, II-II.64, 7).

Here we see a condemnation of ""more than necessary"" violence on the individual level. The ""end"" or aim is self-defense: staying alive. In that context, an act that leads to the death of the assailant is only justifiable as ""necessary violence."" It makes good sense to extrapolate from this discussion, on the individual level, to the level of the state. If the just aim of a state can be achieved without violence, that is, without war, it is not lawful to use war, which involves violence, to achieve it. ""Last resort"" as a criterion for a just war is strongly implied here.

Finally, reasonable chance of success. As noted above, the only justification for an act of self-defense which involves taking the life of a human being is that the intention of the one acting is ""to save one's own life."" Therefore, an act ostensibly in self-defense, but which in reality cannot possibly save one's own life, would be ruled out. In the realm of violence in self-defense on an individual level, it would seem that a reasonable possibility of achieving the aim (saving one's life) is necessary to justify a resort to violence. Extrapolating to the corporate level, how could a war not in immediate self-defense be justified if it had no chance of righting the wrong that was the cause of the war?

Moving away from Aquinas himself, the downgrading of prudential considerations to a risk calculation afterthought that Johnson has suggested here is in stark contrast to an important stream of Catholic philosophy, including that which is most appreciative of Aquinas' thought. As Josef Pieper writes:

Prudence is the cause of the other virtues' being virtues at all. . . . Virtue is a ""perfected ability"" of man as a spiritual person; and justice, fortitude, and temperance, as ""abilities"" of the whole man, achieve their ""perfection"" only when they are founded upon prudence, that is to say upon the perfected ability to make right decisions. . . . Prudence is the ""measure"" of justice . . . The free activity of man is good by its correspondence with the pattern of prudence. What is prudent and what is good are substantially one and the same; they differ only in their place in the logical succession of realization. For whatever is good must first have been prudent. (Pieper, The Four Cardinal Virtues, Richard and Clara Winston, Trs., Lawrence E. Lynch, Tr., Daniel F. Coogan, Tr. (Notre Dame: The University of Notre Dame Press, 1966). Quoted in MAGNIFICAT, August 2007, 40.)

""The Community of Nations""

Johnson argues that Aquinas, in constructing his overall theory, ""builds down from his overall conception of the sovereign's responsibility for the good of the political community,"" and says Aquinas sees ""punishment of evil"" as a specific justification ""within this larger conception of the public good."" However, this is a sweeping reading of Aquinas' words, especially if Johnson means by ""the political community"" the community of nations, as his context appears to indicate (""Just War, As It Was and Is,"" 17). Weigel writes again and again of the defense of ""order"" among nations as a reason for war in classic just war theory (Against the Grain, 221 and elsewhere). Both writers appear to glide imperceptibly, as if by sleight of hand, from classic statements about a government's duty to defend order within its borders and its citizens against attack to new and unlimited statements about a generalized duty to defend order everywhere.

These broad statements do not appear to be supported by a careful reading of the classical writers. In Aquinas' core statement under the ""sovereign authority"" section, he says that just as it is lawful for those in authority

to have recourse to the sword in defending that common weal against internal disturbances, when they punish evil-doers, according to the words of the Apostle (Rom. 13:4): ""He beareth not the sword in vain: for he is God's minister, an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil""; so too, it is their business to have recourse to the sword of war in defending the common weal against external enemies.""

The question here is the good of the citizens who are the direct responsibility of the authority, not of those outside his rule.

Next, here is Aquinas' entire paragraph on just cause:

Secondly, a just cause is required, namely that those who are attacked, should be attacked because they deserve it on account of some fault. Wherefore Augustine says . . . ""A just war is wont to be described as one that avenges wrongs, when a nation or state has to be punished, for refusing to make amends for the wrongs inflicted by its subjects, or to restore what it has seized unjustly.""

Here too, the focus is on specific wrongs, not ""evil"" in general, and in the quotation from Augustine, the specific wrongs appear to have been committed against the nation avenging them. The very word ""avenges"" (except in the case of God, as in ""vengeance is mine, saith the Lord,"") strongly implies action taken by the victim of the original wrong, or at least someone closely related.

Finally, in this same short section, Aquinas' first sentence under ""right intention"" lists ""the advancement of good, or the avoidance of evil."" In none of the three sections is there any specific reference to the community of nations (a concept Aquinas could have easily conveyed, living as he did in an avowedly Christian Europe ruled by a variety of sovereign princes who fought each other rather often). Where there is any focus on specified threats or evil actions, they are, either explicitly or implicitly, against those specific persons for whom those in authority are responsible. In other words, it appears to be generally assumed by Aquinas that an authority that declares war on another nation will do so in response to specific threats or evil done to its own citizens. While the ""right intention"" paragraph also speaks of ""securing peace, of punishing evil-doers, and of uplifting the good,"" it seems most natural to read these ""right intentions"" in light of the previously mentioned limited causes, rather than as conveying a broad responsibility to a ""sovereign"" to ""defend the common good"" outside his borders. Any attempt to find a defense of an expansive ""international order"" in these words of Aquinas requires rather loose reading of his words.

It would strengthen Johnson's and Weigel's position if they were to quote an explicit reference in either Aquinas or Augustine that advised or countenanced the punishment or removal of Government A by Government B for either the wrongs Government A had committed against its own citizens or against Nation C. A right, in extraordinary circumstances, to interfere in another country in such a case, may be derived from the positions of Augustine and Aquinas, (see here for example), but it is not clearly stated there, and that is not the focus of their teaching. Perhaps other writers in the classic just war tradition have clearly stated that the defense of ""order"" among nations is a legitimate cause for war. As writers who are extremely skeptical of the competence of the United Nations to settle disputes, or even to act with authority, Weigel and Johnson are left to build on the right of individual nations to create or ""restore"" ""world order,"" a difficult concept in itself.

The Sovereign's ""Obligation""

Is There an Obligation beyond a Government's Borders?

Weigel and Johnson claim that the place to ""begin thinking about"" just war is the obligation of the sovereign authority to defend ""the peace of order."" As Weigel writes, ""Why can a sovereign override what Dr. Williams calls Aquinas' u2018prima facie case against war'? Because, I suggest, the ruler is under a prior moral obligation, a responsibility to defend the peace of right order. That prior obligation is the beginning of all morally serious thinking about the use of armed force for morally serious ends."" Johnson at one point claims that just war theory is an ""obligation-based moral logic"" (War to Oust, 49). Yet there is barely a hint of any obligation at all in Aquinas' article ""On War."" Throughout the article, Aquinas frames his argument in terms of justice and lawfulness, never ""obligation."" That is true even when he compares the defense of the ""common weal against internal disturbances"" with the defense of the realm ""against external enemies."" (Perhaps Aquinas saw rulers as eager enough to start wars without an ""obligation"" to start them.) The classic on-line Catholic Encyclopedia begin its article on War with ""the right of war,"" not ""the duty of war."" The classic just war theorist Suarez writes: ""Jus belli est odiosum, et poena ejus gravissima; ergo restringenda est quod fieri potest."" ""The right of war is hateful, and its punishment is most grave; therefore it is to be restricted as far as can be."" Even the name of the branch of just war theory with which this whole book is concerned, jus ad bellum, indicates that it concerns the right in connection with going to war, not the responsibility to do so.

According to the Catholic Encyclopedia on War, there is indeed an obligation in connection with war:

The right of war is the right of a sovereign state to wage a contention at arms against another, and is in its analysis an instance of the general moral power of coercion, i.e. to make use of physical force to conserve its rights inviolable. Every perfect right, i.e. every right involving in others an obligation in justice a deference thereto, to be efficacious, and consequently a real and not an illusory power, carries with it at the last appeal the subsidiary right of coercion. A perfect right, then, implies the right of physical force to defend itself against infringement, to recover the subject-matter of right unjustly withheld or to exact its equivalent, and to inflict damage in the exercise of this coercion wherever, as is almost universally the case, coercion cannot be exercised effectively without such damage.

However, it is clear here that the ""obligation"" does not mean an obligation of the sovereign to defend the peace of order, rather it is the obligation of the unjust party to the conflict to render justice in some way, a very different idea. The aggrieved party has the right to go to war in order to enforce the other party to live up to its obligations, not an obligation to go to war to do so. Classic just war theory does not appear to impose any general obligation on a ruler to ""defend the peace of order"" outside his country.

The obligation of a government to defend peace within its borders is widely acknowledged (except by hard-core libertarians or anarchists), so that is hardly a live issue for most. When the subject is starting a war that is not clearly defensive, however, the question usually concerns the use of force beyond the nation's borders. As noted above, there is almost always another government across the border, with its own rights and responsibilities. Does a government ever have an obligation to leave its own borders to establish order?

If There Is an Obligation, What Are Its Limits?

In a number of places, Weigel writes as if there are no limits on the region in which ""the peace of right order"" is to be defended, implying that in the classic tradition every ruler, everywhere, should end evil in every part of the world, even if most cannot (although the U.S. government, he implies, can and should). In ""Moral Clarity in a Time of War"" (Against the Grain, 209), he wrote first ""that rightly constituted public authority is under a strict moral obligation to defend the security of those for whom it has assumed responsibility."" This is certainly the clearly discernible view of Augustine and Aquinas (although ""assumed responsibility"" is debatable). But shortly thereafter in the same essay he refers to ""the moral obligation of government to pursue national security and world order, both of which were directly threatened by the terrorist networks"" (Against the Grain, 210). ""World order"" has crept in here as an equivalent responsibility to the protection of a government's citizens. This view is missing from Aquinas' writing, as noted above. But even if one can ""tease out"" (Against the Grain, 231) such an obligation, through extrapolation and analogy, surely an obligation to defend ""world order"" could hardly be unlimited. Would New Zealand have an unlimited responsibility, for example, to contribute troops in the defense of world order? What about U.S. responsibility toward the Chechens, or the Tibetans, or the long-suffering people of Zimbabwe? As the leading military power in the world, would the United States have an unlimited obligation to end injustice everywhere?

This creation, intentional or not, of an unlimited responsibility to create justice everywhere, appears completely unworkable. Weigel thinks highly of Augustine. Yet the Augustinian conception of a flawed world implies, at the very least, that not every wrong can be righted by a human ruler, who will always be flawed himself. Even a just ruler cannot put absolute justice into effect in the realm of his own responsibility, much less everywhere. A broader ""Augustinian"" awareness would suggest that those attempting to right wrongs have to be aware that they too are susceptible to the temptation to commit injustice, sure to act imperfectly, and likely to fall seriously in some way — and wars often lead to vast unintended consequences.

Surely it makes much more sense to speak of a limited right to defend world order, rather than an unlimited obligation to do so. The limits on that right, of course, are those in just war theory.

Who Should Apply Just War Theory?

Weigel and others have several times called to task theologians who take it upon themselves to apply the criteria and decide whether they have been met in a particular case. Weigel wrote in January 2003:

If the just war tradition is indeed a tradition of statecraft, then the proper role of religious leaders and public intellectuals is to do everything possible to clarify the moral issues at stake in a time of war, while recognizing that what we might call the virtue or moral habit [originally ""charism""] of responsibility lies elsewhere — with duly constituted public authorities, who are more fully informed about the relevant facts and who must bear the weight of responsible decision-making and governance (Against the Grain, 222).

In May 2003, in ""The Sounds of Religion in a Time of War,"" Neuhaus, after writing that ""[t]he cause must be just, and in this case the just cause is the disarmament of Iraq,"" continued:

How best to vindicate the just cause, I insisted, is a matter of practical wisdom, of what is called prudential judgment. In just war doctrine, the Church's competence and responsibility is to set forth the pertinent moral principles. As No. 2309 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church makes clear, the application of those principles to specific cases is the responsibility of political leaders. It is true that religious leaders can claim that the principles are being ignored or misapplied, but in the latter case they do so at the considerable risk of exceeding their competence and undermining their credibility (p. 76).

While Neuhaus is surely right that churches are generally wise not to issue pronouncements on whether the just war criteria have been met in particular cases, both Neuhaus and Weigel went further than that, sharply criticizing ""religious leaders and public intellectuals,"" a category that surely includes trained theologians who speak in public and write books, people like Neuhaus and Weigel, simply for publicly analyzing whether just war criteria had been met. Neuhaus stated his principle broadly: ""the application of those principles to specific cases is the responsibility of political leaders."" It is ambiguous language: the narrow interpretation of this statement would be that the political leaders are the ones who must make the decisions applying the principles. But Neuhaus clearly was criticizing his fellow intellectuals and religious leaders, not for trying to usurp the decision-making power of political leaders, but for simply ""applying . . . principles"" analytically. Johnson wrote in his book on the war, ""One may reasonably wonder what special wisdom the president of the U.S. Catholic Conference brings to making a prudential judgment on the effects of a military action against the Saddam Hussein regime. This kind of judgment belongs properly to those entrusted with the office of government, and moral analysis oversteps its role when it tries to usurp that judgment for itself"" (War to Oust, 49).

As noted, Weigel writes, ""the proper role of religious leaders and public intellectuals is to do everything possible to clarify the moral issues at stake in a time of war,"" implying that they should then be silent on whether a given war is actually just or unjust. He then turned around and advanced his own guess at the reason for Pope John Paul II's lack of use of the word ""unjust"" to describe the war in Iraq (Against the Grain, 230). But if Weigel is right that churches should be silent on precisely this question, then there is simply no legitimate inference to be made from that silence. (Weigel's guess about the Pope's opinion was that ""perhaps in part"" he refused to call the war unjust because ""Catholic Church leaders in Iraq had thanked U.S. diplomatic representatives for liberating their country."" In the context of the Pope's strenuous arguments against the war, as well as the well-known courtly manners practiced in Arab culture, that is a remarkable leap.)

In weighing these arguments, it is useful to begin with the sentence in the Catechism to which Neuhaus was referring: ""The evaluation of these conditions for moral legitimacy belongs to the prudential judgment of those who have responsibility for the common good."" First, although the Catechism uses different language for just war theory, it is quite clear from the entire section (No. 2309) that ""these conditions"" that need to be evaluated are not only the prudential ones, but the question of just cause itself. One of the conditions stated is ""the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations [here is the ""just cause"" concept] must be lasting, grave, and certain."" Therefore, if Neuhaus believed that theologians, either as ""religious leaders"" or as part of the ""Church,"" should limit themselves to ""set[ting] forth the pertinent moral principles,"" he has already broken his own rule in the preceding paragraph by writing that ""the just cause in this case is the disarmament of Iraq."" He cannot have it both ways: if theologians should not ""evaluate the conditions"" by pronouncing that some criteria of the theory (including ""just cause"") are not met, neither should theologians state that they are met. To paraphrase Neuhaus' own words, ""It is true that religious leaders can claim that the principles are being correctly applied, but they do so at the considerable risk of exceeding their competence and undermining their credibility.""

Weigel's articles before the Iraq war and for some time after it began followed the Weigel/Neuhaus rule: theologians should clarify the issues, but not pronounce whether criteria were met. Later, however, he simply broke it. In his April 2006 article ""Iraq: Then & Now"" (Against the Grain, 224-49), as well as his April 2007 article in First Things, ""Just War and Iraq Wars,"" (Against the Grain, 250-69), Weigel engages in multiple evaluations of whether just war criteria were met by the Bush administration. The same is true of much of ""Internationalisms, etc.,"" an extended rumination by Neuhaus in First Things in December 2004 (pp. 64-68).

The argument against theologians making pronouncements on whether criteria are met is largely based on their perceived lack of expertise in dealing with strategic and geopolitical issues. It is interesting in that context to note that Neuhaus, a priest and theologian, believed himself qualified to critique, and dismiss as ""crackpot realism,"" an article on war and strategy by Andrew Bacevich, a West Point-trained colonel with a PhD in international affairs (Neuhaus, ""Interests, Ideals, and World War IV,"" First Things no. 152 (April 2005): 59). Neuhaus' belief in the limits of theologians' expertise had its decided limits in this case. While in the application of just war principles he demanded that others exercise deference to government officials, Neuhaus was willing to go far beyond the boundaries of his own training.

Neuhaus appears to follow Johnson in assuming that the deontological criteria are simply clear and obvious (especially to moral theologians, perhaps?), while the prudential criteria require the calculations of experts. ""The cause must be just, and in this case the just cause is the disarmament of Iraq. . . . How best to vindicate the just cause, I insisted, is a matter of practical wisdom, of what is called prudential judgment."" Yet, as an example of how easy it is for a moral theologian to be mistaken on the facts bearing on ""just cause,"" consider one statement in Neuhaus' article ""The Sounds of Religion in a Time of War."" Near the end of his five-sentence evaluation of the just cause, Neuhaus writes, ""none of these facts were in dispute."" Two of the ""facts"" he cited were ""[Saddam] possessed and was bent upon further developing more horrible weapons,"" and ""his refusal to disarm."" These were not facts, but conjectures, and they were most certainly in dispute, no matter how many U.S. officials had asserted them over the years. In article after article, evidence had been marshaled against these supposed ""facts."" The most powerful consideration, of course, was that UN inspectors, guided by U.S., British, and Israeli intelligence, had scoured the country for years without finding a single piece of evidence that these ""facts"" were true. The UN, it should be noted, did not assert them. When Neuhaus writes that the ""just cause,"" the ""disarmament of Iraq,"" was ""affirmed by multiple resolutions of the UN Security Council,"" he leaves the impression that these multiple resolutions stated that Iraq was not disarmed. Yet Resolution 1441 of November 2002 stated no such thing: concerning WMD it ""deplored"" the lack of full disclosure of records of the programs, and the lack of unrestricted access for the UNSCOM and UNMOVIC (and IAEA) inspectors. The resolution did not even imply UN knowledge, or even a UN opinion, that Saddam possessed such weapons: UN weapons inspectors had had years in which to find them, but had never managed to do so.

The United States scarcely knew what a complex disaster it was confronting when it went to war in Afghanistan on October 7, 2001. It will eventually — perhaps years from now — suffer the same fate as Alexander the Great, the British, and the now-defunct Soviet Union: defeat.

What is called ""Afghanistan"" is really a collection of tribes and ethnic groups — Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, and more — there are seven major ethnic groups, each with their own language. There are 30 minor languages. Pashtuns are 42 percent of the population and the Taliban comes from them. Its borders are contested and highly porous, and al-Qaeda is most powerful in the Pashtun regions of northern Pakistan as well as Afghanistan. ""The fate of Afghanistan and Pakistan are inextricably tied,"" President George Bush declared in December 2007. This fact makes the war far more complicated, not the least because enormous quantities of military aid sent to Pakistan is mostly wasted.

Worse yet, Pakistan possesses about 70 to 90 nuclear weapons and the U.S. fears some may fall into the hands of Islamic extremists. At least three-quarters of the supplies essential for America’s and its allies’ war effort flow through Pakistan, and they are often assaulted. Moreover, a large and growing majority of the Pakistanis distrust U.S. motives. The U.S.’s tilt to New Delhi after 2007, which greatly augmented Indian nuclear power, made Pakistan far more reticent to do Washington’s bidding.

Afghanistan is a mess, complex beyond description with mountainous terrain to match. Its principal problems are political, social, and cultural — in large part because Great Britain concocted it arbitrarily. There is no durable military solution to its many problems. As in Vietnam, the U.S. will win battles but it has no strategy for winning this war.

Above all, the regional geo-political context is decisive, involving, India-Pakistan relations — a factor that will prevail whatever the United States and its allies do. Pakistan’s most vital interest is seeing a friendly government rule Afghanistan — no matter who it is. They will not waver on this principle. The Pakistani military is adamant about making India its key focus, and while it is opposed to al Qaeda and the Arab membership, it maintains good relations with the anti-Karzai Taliban — with whom it worked when it fought the Soviets.

The power of Afghanistan’s nominal president, Hamid Karzai, barely extends beyond Kabul, and his inefficiency and corruption shocks many U.S. leaders — most of whom, as in South Vietnam, are ultimately prepared to tolerate it. The Pakistanis regard Karzai as an Indian puppet, and however much many of its leaders dislike Pashtun separatism or the Taliban, they fear India far more. Their military is structured to fight India, not a counterinsurgency against the Taliban and its allies who operate within its borders.

Karzai, a Pashtun who nonetheless is far closer to Tajiks and Uzbeks, is indeed very cordial to India. Indian foreign aid to his government has amounted to over a billion dollars. His ""re-election"" earlier this month — at a time when he is increasingly unpopular — has been attacked as based on fraud. Former President Jimmy Carter declared ""Hamid Karzai has stolen the election.""

This is only part of the context in which the U.S. has been mired for eight years, and Obama’s strategy of escalation will confront growing resistance both in Afghanistan and among the U.S. Congress and public. There are now over 100,000 foreign troops in Afghanistan, mainly American, and more will not change the situation. Fifty-eight percent of the American population was against the Afghan war in September this year, and in some NATO nations — particularly Germany, Great Britain, and Italy — opposition to the war is increasing. These countries will not send significantly more troops to fight there. Influential U.S. Senators — who are still a small minority but an indication the war is becoming increasingly unpopular within the U.S. — are questioning Obama’s strategy.

Obama’s approach to winning the war is far too convoluted to succeed and it is dependent on factors over which he has scant control — not the least being the advice of one of his key advisers, Bruce Riedel, that ""the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the central all-consuming issue for al Quada."" This issue must finally be settled; the chances of that happening are close to non-existent. Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was President Jimmy Carter’s national security adviser, has warned Obama on several occasions that ""we are running the risk of replicating … the fate of the Soviets."" As the author of Moscow’s ""Afghan trap,"" he should know.

Still, Obama is likely to escalate. Apart from the ""credibility"" of American power being involved, most key American officers think, to quote chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen, that ""the main effort in our strategic focus from a military perspective must now shift to Afghanistan."" A few officers, mostly lacking influence, believe it will lead to disaster, and the American military commander in Afghanistan at the end of last September warned that unless there is a rapid escalation of troops within a year the war ""will likely result in failure.""

Meanwhile, Obama thinks he will win the war by escalation — an illusion that also marked the futile war in Vietnam. He also believes he can ""Afghanisize"" the war — like Nixon thought he could ""Vietnamize"" that conflict — even though recruits for Karzai’s army have little motivation apart from collecting their salary, and are scarcely a match for the Taliban — a quite divided, complex organization which today dominates much of the country.

A growing majority of the Afghan population now oppose the U.S. effort because they have led to frightful civilian casualties without attaining decisive military successes. ""The mission is on the verge of failing,"" a writer in the U.S. Army’s quarterly, Parameters, concluded last spring.

That, indeed, may be an understatement.

Recently by Gary North: Why Ron Paul Never Fit in on Capitol Hill

I want to discuss an article. I may be exaggerating, but I regard this article as the most sophisticated exercise in terminal naiveté that I have ever read. It is an intelligent article with respect to the problems that it lays out. It is dealing with the Ponzi scheme economics of the modern world. Certainly, I am in favor of articles that discuss modern government economic policies as Ponzi schemes. I have been doing this for over 45 years, and I see no reason to stop now, especially since we are 45 years closer to the end of the Ponzi schemes.

Yet at the same time, I am always dismayed to see an article written about the inevitable Ponzi scheme collapse of the modern economic world that begins with some version of this assurance: if we act now, we can solve this. It is not too late. The article begins as follows:

Fortunately, there is still time to act. But leaders from all social sectors–government, business, organized labor, environmental and other stakeholder groups–need to act decisively and quickly in order to secure future economic prosperity, social cohesion, and political stability. It is in the nature of Ponzi schemes to collapse suddenly, without warning. No one knows what event may send the developed world and the global economy as a whole back into crisis.

I have heard some variation of this assurance for over 45 years. In fact, if a book on Social Security, Medicare, and the unfunded liabilities of the U.S. government is published by a major publisher, or if an article appears in a journal aimed at establishment intellectuals, it will have the obligatory disclaimer. It will not be published unless there is this assurance somewhere in the article. There are no articles published by respectable scholars or respectable columnists on the Ponzi scheme economics of the modern world that do not include such an assurance. Anyone who insists on the fact that there is going to be a collapse, that these schemes will end in default, and that there is no possible statistically way of avoiding this, will not get his article published in a respectable magazine, newspaper, or book.

This is why I always look for the disclaimer. If there is the disclaimer, I know that I am about to read utter poppycock. It may be highly footnoted poppycock. It may have lots of charts. If it is written by somebody trying to get tenure, it will be filled with arcane mathematical formulas. But it does not matter what the content is, or what the structure is, the article is total poppycock.

WHAT YOU MEAN “WE,” PALEFACE?

The key poppycock indicator is the word “we.” Readers are assured that if we take immediate steps, courageously, systematically, and if we continue to implement the writer’s recommended program of reform, there is still hope to avoid the chaos and devastation that is the inevitable result of every Ponzi scheme in history.

Why is this poppycock? First, because of the nature of every Ponzi scheme. The scheme that Charles Ponzi invented was doomed from the beginning. There was no way statistically that that scheme would not collapse, leaving devastation in its wake. Whether we are talking Charles Ponzi or Bernie Madoff, from the day the deception began, there was no possible way that the scheme would not run aground on the shoals of statistical reality.

The scheme could not have been stopped at any time. The participants in the scheme, from the day they got into it, would not consider the possibility that they had been completely conned by someone who sold them a story that was based on a statistical impossibility. This is a true Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme must end with losses for all but the participants who got in early and got out early. The only people to win in a Ponzi scheme are the people who recognize it as fake, who get in early, get out early, take the money and run. They spot it as a fraud from day one; therefore, they have an exit strategy.

The astounding thing about Ponzi schemes is not that there is an endless supply of suckers, including sophisticated investors, who believe in it. The astounding thing about Ponzi schemes is that their originators seldom disappear with the money, never to be seen again. Charles Ponzi is the classic example. If he had taken the money, which was in the tens of millions in an era in which the dollar was worth 20 times as much as it is today, and if he returned to Italy, from which he had arrived, he would have made out like the bandit that he was. But he stayed in the game until the bitter end. So did Bernard Madoff. The originators know that the thing cannot possibly end well, and yet they are unwilling to take the money and run. They believe their own impossible promises. This, I do not understand.

The essence of the Ponzi scheme is not simply its statistical unsustainability. The essence of the Ponzi scheme is that it is like an addictive drug. Once someone enters into it, he finds it psychologically impossible to face the reality of the unsustainable statistics of the program. He refuses to get out in time. His participation in the scheme fundamentally changes his outlook toward reality. He is no longer capable of being persuaded that he has made a fool of himself by entering into such a scheme. This includes the founder of the scheme. The essence of the Ponzi scheme is not statistical; it is psychological. It creates belief in that which is statistically impossible, and the degree of belief is so strong that anyone who points out the statistical impossibility of the scheme risks being cut off personally by the victim. Ponzi scheme economics creates the classic attitude: shoot the messenger.

What also is astounding about Ponzi schemes is that the messengers never understand the nature of the psychology which undergirds the Ponzi schemes. The messengers come before the victims of the scheme, and they lay out their evidence. Their evidence may be fairly simple, or it may be highly sophisticated. But the person who lays out the evidence is also suffering from terminal naiveté. He thinks that he can bring people to their senses by means of evidence. He thinks that he can persuade someone who is the victim of a Ponzi scheme to change his ways right now, to get out of the scheme immediately, to take out his money if he can, or at least stop putting any new money into it. He thinks he can get a rational response from somebody who is knee-deep, waist-deep, or armpit-deep in a Ponzi scheme which has, on paper, made him rich.

Why should the victim pay any attention to a messenger who comes to him with a twofold message: first, he is going to lose all of his money; second, that he was an idiot for believing in the scheme in the first place. The messenger does not actually tell the victim that he was a fool to get into the project, but that is the inescapable implication of his criticism. This is fully understood the victim. He has no interest in the stack of papers or graphs or formulas that show that the scheme in which he has invested his money is statistically impossible to fulfill, and worse, that such a scheme would only appeal to somebody who is terminally nave.

Every Ponzi scheme is a daisy chain. It is a daisy chain of people who have this sign on their backs: I am terminally nave. This includes the founder, the victims, and the messengers who come before the victims to try to warn them that they have gotten into a statistically impossible scheme that could only have been promoted by a confidence man.

The messenger wants the victim to believe that there is hope if he takes effective action now. What hope? He can get his money back. But all the others can’t get their money back. There is still hope for him, but not for most investors. Maybe he will still come to his senses. Therefore, the messenger is as terminally nave as the victim of the scheme. That is because the essence of a Ponzi scheme is not statistical; it is psychological. It is the belief that there are great benefits without great risks, that there are above-average profits without above-average risk. In short, there is a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.

The victim of the Ponzi scheme believes that the man who sold him on the scheme is a real live leprechaun who is going to lead him and all of the others in the program to the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

When you deal with somebody who believes in pots of gold at the end of rainbows, and who trusts salesman who are obviously in the leprechaun-imitation business, you are not dealing with somebody who is going to respond favorably to carefully prepared refutations of the statistical plausibility of the scheme.

SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM

For over four decades, I have come before people and warned them of the statistical impossibility of the Social Security System and the Medicare system. Never have I implied that the system could be reformed. I have denied the political possibility of any such reform. Never have I warned the person to try to get out of the system. Why not? Because it is compulsory, and inherent in the nature of modern citizenship.

We live in a Ponzi scheme economy. This means that we live in a society in which the vast majority of voters have adopted leprechaun economics, and have re-elected leprechauns on a regular basis since 1935 in the United States, and since 1889 in Germany.

I have always come with this message: “You may be able to escape the worst effects of the Ponzi scheme, but only if you take active steps now that will enable you to escape a system that has been imposed on you by law, for which you are not personally responsible.”

When you come to the victim of a Ponzi scheme with this message, namely, that he was forced into it, and therefore he is not the victim of his own terminal naiveté, you have at least an outside possibility of persuading him. He may begin to take steps to evade the worst aspects of the inevitable collapse that the Ponzi scheme will produce in the lives of virtually all members of society. He does not think you are calling him a dupe of politicians, even though that is what he has been.

Only a tiny fraction of the population will be willing to listen to such a warning. That is despite the fact that they believe in the system, participate in it enthusiastically, and do not believe that it is going to blow up in their faces. They are nave. Only a tiny fraction of the population is ready to listen to the story of the Ponzi scheme, and only if there is a least an outside possibility that they, personally, will be able to escape the worst effects of the inevitable breakdown of the scheme.

Tell a man that he personally has hope, and he may listen. Tell him, in effect, that the vast majority of his neighbors and peers are terminally nave, and victims of a political con job, and he may listen. He has always suspected that they are not too bright anyway. He has always suspected that he is brighter than they are. So, he may be willing to listen.

This is why it never ceases to amaze me that sophisticated economists with academic degrees go to enormous trouble to present cogent analyses regarding the Ponzi scheme nature of the present economy. They spend lots of time amassing evidence of the Ponzi scheme nature of the modern economy, and then they try to tell their readers that there really is hope for the economy if “we” act now. There is clearly no possible hope for the economy. That is because Ponzi schemes are based on leprechaun economics. Nobody gets into one of these schemes who is not from the beginning a believer in leprechauns. They want access to the pot of gold at the end of that government-guaranteed rainbow.

Here is the bottom line. Most voters in the United States since 1935 have believed that the federal government is in fact staffed by well-meaning leprechauns whose only real interest is in providing voters personally with a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, either at the age of 62, with early retirement, or later, if the voter wants to maximize access to that pot of gold. We have in the West an entire civilization, which we call Western civilization, which is based on leprechaun economics.

Occasionally, a Charles Ponzi or a Bernie Madoff comes along and takes advantage of this faith in leprechaun economics on a personal basis. It is not just that middle-class people and working class people believe in government leprechauns. It is that very rich and sophisticated people believe in SEC- approved leprechauns. This, by the way, includes everybody in the SEC, which regulated Madoff. Why? Because the moment they approved the leprechaun who was selling the Ponzi scheme, they got sucked into it to. To admit at this late date that they had been completely conned by a man like Madoff is to imagine that they will turn away in horror at their own stupidity and naiveté, admit that they were completely conned by this man, and say they are really sorry that everybody who put any money into this man’s hand is going to lose everything they have given him. That would be a $$50 billion admission of error. Anyone who thinks that a government agency is going to make this kind of admission before the program is forced into the bankruptcy by the market is himself terminally nave.

From the top to the bottom, from East to West, once one of these schemes begins, it always goes over the cliff. The statistical inevitability of the scheme always asserts itself, because the psychological inevitability of the scheme asserts itself. Almost no one has sufficient self-awareness to overcome his own ego in the name of personal economic self-interest. Almost nobody has a strong enough ego to admit that he had been taken in by this con man. For those few people who do have a strong ego, and who are willing to admit that they have been taken in, their personal self-interest is not in informing the SEC about the con job. Their personal self-interest is in getting whatever money they can out of the system, before everybody else finds out. So, there is almost no incentive whatsoever for anybody who is participating in the system to take personal steps to end the system prior to the inevitable explosion. Once started, a Ponzi scheme cannot be stopped by well-meaning messengers.

SELF-INTEREST AT THE MARGIN

We now come to the heart of the matter, economically speaking, which is economic theory.

The first principle of modern economics is that people make decisions in terms of their personal self-interest. The second principle of modern economics, far less known, is that all decisions are made at the margin. When you accept the truth of these two principles, you can be sure that any prescription or solution that is offered by the enthusiastic bringer of the message, whoever he may be, or how many degrees he has after his name, does not know what he is talking about if he uses the word “we.”

Lies

the Government Told You: Myth, Power, and Deception in American

History, by Andrew P. Napolitano (Nashville: Thomas Nelson,

2010), 349 pages.

Americans

take for granted that politicians lie. You know one is lying when

his lips are moving, so goes the joke. Even citizens snookered by

one politicians lies will quickly acknowledge that the other

side lies.

Bush

Lied, People Died, says the bumper sticker from a few years

back, but many Republicans refused to concede that their president

would knowingly deceive the public into war. You lie!

shouted Rep. Joe Wilson at a frustrated President Obama on the question

of health care for illegal immigrants  an accusation that

was celebrated by the TEA Party Right, but left-liberals found the

charge preposterous, even seditious.

Of course

governments lie and always have. The state cannot maintain its grip

on the people through violence alone  propaganda is an essential

element in governance. Without a public ideology of statism, Leviathan

cannot rule with a free hand. Such fictional dystopias as depicted

in Orwells 1984 rely on lies outrageously brazen. Real-life

totalitarian regimes deceive the world about the conditions endured

by their people. The USSRs Potemkin Village was but a microcosm

of this essentially inevitable tendency of total states to employ

window dressing to obscure their killing fields. In America, police

are trained to lie to lull suspects into self-incrimination. Presidents

have lied to whip the nation into a war frenzy for well over a century.

Even when politicians believe their own lies, government itself

utilizes falsehoods and disinformation to expand its power.

What a treat

that Andrew P. Napolitano, Fox News legal analyst and a libertarian

anomaly within the legal community, has provided us with a solid

book on the U.S. governments many lies. Lies the Government

Told You takes on every sacred cow of the establishment 

left, right, and center. Unlike the partisan and predictable sensationalism

we get from most commentators, Napolitano exposes lies regardless

of political ideology, partisan loyalties, political correctness,

American exceptionalism, or any of the other trappings we expect

from the talking heads.

Founding

myths

Understandably,

Americans distrust government claims, given their tradition of anti-government

skepticism. But typically, a narrative will uncover lies associated

with either conservative or liberal readings of history, while ignoring

the others. For example, many conservative historians idolize the

Founding Fathers, champion U.S. wars, and timidly criticize leftist

economic myths. The Left, in turn, will criticize the Founders,

question some U.S. wars, but then adopt absurdities about how Americas

free market caused the Great Depression and every other ill in U.S.

history.

Napolitano

will have none of that. He tells it like it is. The Founding Fathers?

Hypocrites of course  for all their talk about all mens

being created equal, four of the first five American presidents,

including the still-beloved George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,

and James Madison, owned slaves. Washington comes off as a

particularly cruel taskmaster. He raffled off the slaves of

those bankrupt slave-holders who owed him money [and even] hired

a dentist to extract nine teeth from the mouths of his slaves, and

implant them into his own mouth.

At the same

time, an unqualified resentment toward all for which these men stood

neglects the ideals of liberty for which they did, at times, stand

courageously. Napolitano, unlike the politically correct Left, pulls

no punches but still has the nuance appropriate to historical study.

He credits Jefferson for pushing for the anti-slavery Northwest

Ordinance and struggling with the greatest ethical dilemma of his

time, and praises Benjamin Franklin for his pioneering anti-slavery

work.

The abolitionist

William Lloyd Garrison is favorably cited for his opinion that

the Constitution was actually a pro-slavery document.

But Napolitano does not agree with the typical reading of Abraham

Lincoln on the question of slavery: Lincoln opposed slaverys

expansion into Americas new territories not based on any moral

duty to uphold the Natural Law, or the need to right inherent wrongs.

Instead, Lincoln simply wanted to keep African-Americans out of

the West and keep the white and black races separate.

The conventional

view of the Founders and Lincoln has allowed for an elevation of

those men to a near-religious place in many Americans hearts,

which is troubling for a people supposedly dedicated to liberty

and distrust of government. As for the myth that Americans to this

day enjoy inalienable rights to property and the fruits

of their labor, Napolitano cites the Kelo decision, upholding

Connecticut eminent domain in behalf of private interests.

The idea

that a city government, or any government for that matter, can

justify a taking of ones private property to give to another

private entity for the local governments economic benefit

is one that utterly obscures the distinction between takings for

private and public use.

The courts

have likewise undercut contractual liberty: [Like] our right

to private property, our natural right to contract, as well as the

rights defined in the Contracts Clause of the Constitution (Article

I, Section 10, Clause 1), have been repeatedly violated by the

government, as when the Supreme Court upheld a Minnesota

law prohibiting banks from foreclosing upon mortgages that were

in default in Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell

(1934).

The judiciary

and constitutional rights

The judiciary

is often hailed as being separate from the governments political

vagaries and coercive nature, but Napolitano kills that myth. Far

from being like umpires or folks who dispassionately

follow the Constitution, judges are political beings with biases

and human failings. During the Sonya Sotomayor confirmation hearings,

conservatives feared that she would let her ethnic and ideological

concerns trump judicial objectivity. They often accuse liberal judges

of trying to make the law, but that hardly began with Obamas

judicial appointments, or indeed with any of the liberal judges

of the modern era: the real precedent was set with Marbury v.

Madison in 1803, handed down by the revered Chief Justice John

Marshall, which expanded the effective reach of the Court in determining

questions of constitutionality. Marshall clearly engaged in

a form of policymaking or activism. On the other

hand, There have been many Supreme Court opinions throughout

history in which the Court should have acted in a more activist

way, but failed to stand up to government abuse. In Plessy

v. Ferguson, the Court upheld governmentally mandated racial

segregation.

At the same

time, true judicial activism does exist, as in Roe v. Wade,

where the seven-justice majority … blatantly legislated

from the bench. A less popular, yet exceedingly ridiculous,

example of judicial activism occurred in the case of Missouri

v. Jenkins, where U.S. District Judge Russell Clark ordered

[Kansas City] to increase property taxes on its citizens by 91

percent! A court of appeals panel upheld that order.

Local governments

have long undermined the ability of blacks and minorities to vote.

But judicial activism has also played a role in hijacking the vote,

most notably in Bush v. Gore in 2000, which Napolitano calls

an assault on federalism and freedom…. [The] conservatives

acted out of character. Until Bush v. Gore, neither the Supreme

Court, nor any other federal court, had ever enforced a uniformity

rule in the counting of ballots. Napolitano attributes some

of that decision to the justices political motivation,

describing the close ties Justices Scalia and OConnor had

to Republican politicians and the Bush family.

Finally, we

are told that every vote counts, but that is an oversimplification

at best. Before the Seventeenth Amendment, senators were elected

by state legislators.

Personal

liberties

But surely

some rights are treated reverently? Napolitano would beg to differ.

Freedom of speech is invaluable to our personal autonomy because

it removes constraints on our ability to think what we want to believe.

It is a natural right that preceded the existence of the United

States. But politicians have uprooted this sacrosanct right.

Under Woodrow Wilson, opponents of his war faced up to twenty

years in jail for the utterance of government-prohibited political

speech through legislation upheld by the Supreme Court.

Filmmaker Robert Goldstein was sentenced to ten years

in prison for his movie about the American Revolution, depicting

Great Britain as the enemy. Because Britain was an ally in World

War I, even such patriotic films became a federal offense. Since

World War I, political agitators have been jailed for sedition,

adult movie-makers have been persecuted under obscenity laws, and

the Fairness Doctrine was used to effectively silence radio commentators.

The right

to bear arms has not fared much better. The first people targeted

(other than blacks) were the poor  The core of the National

Firearms Act was the price people were expected to pay. In order

to register a shotgun, payment of $$200 was required … equal to

$$3,056.11 at todays values. Later, in 1968, came

the Gun Control Act and the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets

Act and numerous other local, state, and federal gun restrictions.

Guns are used defensively more than two million times per

year, but we are moving toward a political culture where only

the police have a right to bear arms.

In terms of

due-process rights, Napolitano discusses pretrial hearings, the

treatment of the accused in jail as though they are convicted criminals,

holes in the insanity defense, civil commitments, guilt by association,

prosecutor and police deception, and court precedent that an innocent

man cannot appeal on the basis that he has proof of his actual

innocence as stark examples that Americans are not always

treated as innocent until proven guilty. Recent DNA analysis shows

how indisputably false is the idea that our system protects the

innocent. The Fourth Amendment, meanwhile, has been obliterated

by the secret courts set up by FISA in 1978 (between the years

of 1979 to 2007, this rubber stamp … rejected only

nine of the 25,361 warrant applications submitted to it)

and the post–9/11 National Security Letters (the NSL is in

essence a search warrant, but one that requires no probable cause

or judicial oversight and that allows for any federal agent to request

any and all of your personal records). There is also a terrific

chapter on the myth that we dont torture, exploring

detention policy after 9/11 and its threats to habeas corpus.

How about

the right to control ones own body? That has been made a joke

by everything from deadly FDA regulations that deprive dying Americans

of life-saving drugs to petty bans on transfats. The drug war conspicuously

challenges the concept of self-ownership. Napolitano provides a

chapter on drug policy and elsewhere shows that RICO statutes, wartime

hysteria, and other statist favorites have allowed for constitutional

protections to be diminished under special circumstances.

Americas

supposed free market

We often hear

that a government program is only temporary  another

lie demolished by Napolitano, who cites income taxation and withholding

(when the government takes from us, it is just as immoral

as any other type of burglar), rent control (originally

meant only to help wives and children while husbands and fathers

were fighting World War II, it has become an enduring and harmful

legacy), and Social Security (thievery at the highest

possible level) as examples of programs lasting far beyond

their advocates promises. Napolitano takes aim at FEMA, an

agency with no lawful basis that bungled its response

to Katrina, as a typical instance showing that Im from

the government and Im here to help you is often without

much truth.

Napolitano

also takes on an issue the mainstream neglects: the monopoly control

of money and its systematic debasement for political ends. The Federal

Reserve has turned our money from gold to toilet paper

and, despite what the Feds champions of 1913 promised, is

not effectively controlled by Congress but has become a legally

sanctioned cartel responsible for financial panics and massively

regressive inflation. In essence, Congress struck a deal with

the private bankers who would run the Federal Reserve, granting

them absolute power over the control of Americas money …

in exchange for infinitely deep pockets.

One chapter

explores the myth that America has a free market, addressing

the housing boom and bust that occurred in an atmosphere of heavy

regulation and subsidy. Yet, even with all the laws and regulations

around, the government continues to blame deregulation and the free

market, despite the fact that we have seventy-three

thousand pages of detailed government [economic] regulations.

Then came the finance and auto bailouts, after which the lesson

learned was that as long as you did not take responsibility for

your actions, then you would receive more money.

War

Napolitano

devotes a chapter to the vital topic of wartime propaganda and lies.

There is the seminal example of the Lusitania sinking 

President Woodrow Wilson wanted innocent American deaths to

justify politically American entry into World War I. But that

was not the first time, nor the last that America saw

such propaganda. In 1898, President McKinley used the sinking

of the USS Maine in Havana Harbor. A most exciting

section discusses the eight-point plan used to lure

Japan into firing the first shot in 1941: The United States

got word of the Pearl Harbor attack in January 1941, eleven

months prior to the actual event, which was provoked,

undoubtedly anticipated, and ardently hoped for by the privately

lying President who publicly condemned it. The infamy was his.

Years later,

in 1964, the Pentagon jumped on the Gulf of Tonkin incident to escalate

U.S. intervention in Vietnam. A 2005 NSA report revealed,

however, that not only was there no North Vietnamese attack on August

4, but there may not have even been any North Vietnamese boats in

the area. Napolitano extends his analysis to the current day:

President George W. Bushs use of deception to trick

Congress and the American people into authorizing the Iraq War should

go down as one of the deadliest, yet most creative marketing jobs

in the history of the world.

For government

to expand and abuse its power, the public must put up with it. The

ideology of statism is the key factor in allowing for Americas

bloated welfare-warfare state. To chip away at that ideology, we

must show that so much at the core of Americas civic statist

religion is built on lies and deception. Lies the Government

Told You is an excellent introduction to these lies, on a wide

range of topics, and always with a focus on individual liberty as

the moral foundation of a just society.

223256,"Ralph Raico Is Mr. Classical Liberal

by Walter Block

Recently by Walter Block: Religion and Libertarianism

Review of Raico, Ralph. 2012. Classical Liberalism and the Austrian School. Auburn, AL: The Mises Institute, 347 pages

Words are important in political economic philosophy. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that verbiage is all important in these fields, as they consist of nothing but utterances bandied about. He who controls them controls the dialogue, controls the debate.

Even the previous sentence, in most ways not controversial, is in one way an instance of this very contention, and very debatable. For it began with the word ""he."" In some quarters this is highly objectionable. The claim of the feminists is that I should have said, instead, ""he or she,"" or ""he/she,"" or better yet, ""she or he,"" ""she/he"" and best of all, plain old ""she."" Perhaps, so as to have given no offense, I should have put this in the third person, ""they.""

To the extent they can make this stick, our friends on the left have gone a long way toward winning all the debates they have with their intellectual enemies. If the socialists can insist that we all use their language, they have won half the battle — if not more.

The trouble is, those of us who favor free enterprise, very limited government, private property rights, capitalism, etc., have been ceding all too many words to those on the other side of the aisle. It is all the more difficult to make our case if we must do so by using words demanded of us by our intellectual opponents. Capitalism no longer refers to laissez faire; it now invokes cronyism and imperialism. Leftists such as Noam Chomsky are even now trying to seize ownership of ""libertarian"" and John Dewey long ago made a run at ""individualist.""

But there is no word that has been stolen from us to a greater degree, or with more effect than ""liberal."" And then it has been trashed to such a degree that even the thieves have given up on it and now characterize themselves as ""progressives."" Surprising to many, this used to be one of our own possessions, and still is to some small degree as in ""classical liberal.""

We might as well call the author of the book now under review Ralph (""Mr. Liberal"") Raico because he has done more than anyone else to rescue this verbiage back from its kidnappers, dust it off from the garbage they have piled up on it, and convince us that ""liberal"" has a long and very glorious pedigree, and, once again, thanks to him a very bright future.

Chapter 1 links (classical) liberalism to the Austrian School of economics, which makes the supposedly free enterprise Chicago School look like the pinkos they are. This essay comes to us with particularly good timing, given the yeoman work Ron Paul has recently done in promoting the work of the leading Austrians such as Mises, Hayek and Rothbard. In this breathless chapter Raico lays waste to T.W. Hutchison, Karl Popper, Milton Friedman, Karl Marx and Isaiah Berlin for either economic or philosophical errors or both. Our author is so thorough in his analysis that he even takes on Carl Menger the father of Austrian economics, for his failure to distinguish ""between state and civil society, coercion and voluntarism,"" surely the most crucial distinction in all of political philosophy. Hayek, Austrian economics' only Nobel Prize winner, also comes in for Raico's uncompromising critical analysis, on the ground that he mistakenly rejects apriorism in economics and the role of Austrian intellectual imperialism in undermining not merely social reform but outright socialism.

In chapter 2, Liberalism True and False Raico clears away the underbrush so that we can clearly see who is a (classical) liberal and who is not. You will be sitting at the edge of your chair when you learn why it is that Richard Cobden, John Bright, Herbert Spencer, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, Lord Acton, de Jouvenel, Ludwig von Mises and the Salamancans make the cut while Bismarck, Friedrich Naumann, Karl Popper, John Rawls, Lionel Trilling, John Dewey, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. (""New Deal hack""), and John Stuart Mill (sic!) do not. States Raico on this latter somewhat surprising case: ""Mill's view tends to erase the rather critical distinction between incurring social disapproval and incurring imprisonment.""

The third chapter is the best analysis I have ever seen of why intellectuals oppose true liberalism: free enterprise and the marketplace. There are no truer words said that Schumpeter's: ""capitalism stands its trial before judges who have the sentence of death in their pockets,"" Raico tells us. What are the explanations? There is Hayek's view that this stems from honest errors, Schumpeter's emphasis on the intellectuals seeking after sinecure government employment, Mises' focus on resentment and a contempt for money making (don't ask), and Schoek's spotlight on envy. Raico takes us on an exhilarating tour of the views on this important issue, also of Murray N. Rothbard, George Stigler, Douglass C. North and Robert Higgs.

So important is Keynes in this analysis of liberalism that Raico devotes an entire chapter 4 to examining the case for considering him a member of this class. I'll give you the punchline: No. Keynes didn't try to ""save capitalism,"" as we have been mislead to believe. If anything, this economist was closer to fascism, as the forward to the German edition of his most famous book, General Theory, amply demonstrates.

You thought that class analysis was a monopoly of the Marxists? Well, think again. In chapter 5 Raico uncovers a little known but vitally important aspect of intellectual history: liberal or libertarian class analysis. Hint: it is not based on the erroneous and misbegotten labor theory of value. There is no incompatibility let alone necessary battle between labor and capital. Rather, this type of class analysis pertains to, in a word (remember those entities? If not, check out the first paragraph of this book review, above) robbery, mainly via the tender mercies of the government. All too many people, Raico avers, even Albert O. Hirschman, misunderstand the liberal class analysis brilliantly developed by Vilfredo Pareto, Adolphe Blanqui, Francois Guizot, Augustin Thierry, Charles Comte, Charles Dunoyer, Antoine Destutt de Tracy, J.B. Say and John C. Calhoun, and radiantly brought to us by Raico.

In chapter 6 our author asks us to remove our eyes, for once in our lives, from the British liberals such as Adam Smith whose ""reputation (unjustifiably ) almost blinds the sun"" in the words of Murray N. Rothbard and also from his countrymen Malthus, Ricardo and Mill. Instead, Raico advices, let us cast them toward the continent, and particularly France, from whence a much more principled and rigorous liberalism emanated, in the hands of Cantillon, Turgot, Say, Bastiat, Constant, Tocqueville, along with the Spanish Salamancans. One of the main violators of this advice is the Anglophile Hayek, who is enamored of spontaneous order and rejects constructivism (the product of deliberate ""contrivance and design."") But not every institution that ""evolves"" can be justified on libertarian/liberal grounds, for example, suttee and slavery.

I pass over a discussion of German liberalism (it is not a contradiction in terms — thanks to Eugen Richter and others) in order to more fully consider Raico's treatment of Mises' liberalism. The basic premise of this system was the private ownership of property. This might sound eminently reasonable to modern (classical) liberals, but certainly it was denied by the likes of J.S. Mill, Isaiah Berlin and John Rawls. Liberalism rejects Marxist Socialism communism; that much is clear. So is liberalism part of the right, namely fascism? Since this part of the political spectrum also defends private property (superficially, in any case), and Mises, liberalisms' greatest modern spokesman (not spokesperson) did indeed see fascism as preferable to Bolshevism, this conclusion would appear to follow as Herbert Marcuse and Claus-Dieter Krohn have charged. Not so, not so, maintains Raico: ""Mises criticized and rejected Fascism on a number of crucial grounds: for its illiberal and interventionist economic program, its foreign policy based on force… and most fundamentally its u2018complete faith in the decisive power of violence' instead of rational argument.""

Do I have any reservations about this superb book? Only minor ones. Raico accepts the terminology ""rent seeking"" as a description of one of the worst practices of statism. But why pick on innocent ""rent"" to depict what should be called instead, booty seeking or theft or plunder? Here is another. Raico's blanket condemnation of taking money from the state and welfare statism might be misinterpreted so as to oppose innocent people using government roads, libraries, schools, currency, etc. This of course was no part of his intention, but might have been better explained. These minor cavils aside, this is a gem of a book. I learned a lot from it, and, I expect, so will everyone else.

Let me add a personal note to this review. I have known Ralph Raico since I met him in Murray Rothbard's living room in the mid 1960s. I have learned from him, been inspired by him, and have been lucky enough to count him as a friend ever since then. I thought I well knew his views. But, still, this book of his really blew me away. Those of you who do not know Ralph as well as I do are lucky he has written this masterpiece. Here, you get Prof. Raico in a concentrated form, ranging widely and deeply over politics, economics and history. Enjoy. You are in store for a real treat.

10856,"Following his second-place finish in the New Hampshire GOP primary, when Ron Paul stood before the television cameras to address the crowd, he didnt crow about his personal victory or denigrate his opponents. Instead, he told supporters that we are dangerous to the status quo of the country, and spoke about the power of ideas.

I think the Intellectual Revolution thats going on now to restore liberty in this country is well on its way, and theres no way theyre going to stop the momentum that we have started, Ron Paul said.

In fact, Gerald Celente has been championing the call for an Intellectual Revolution for years. In 2009 he secured the domain www.IntellectualRevolution.com, and in an April 2009 Trend Alert he wrote:

I am calling for an Intellectual Revolution. This is a revolution about thinking  not manning the barricades. Its about brain power  not brute force.

Nothing short of total repudiation of our entrenched systems can rescue America. We are under the control of a two-headed, one party political system. Wall Street controls our financial lives; the media manipulates our minds. These systems cannot be changed from within. There is no alternative. Without a revolution, these institutions will bankrupt the country, keep fighting failed wars, start new ones, and hold us in intellectual subjugation.

In 2009, when Celente was broaching the concept of an Intellectual Revolution, it was those who felt taxed to death, angry at government bailouts, outraged by Wall Street greed, and bitterly resentful of a system that rewards the undeserving rich, who were ready to revolt.

Nearly three years later, in Ron Pauls view, its no longer that irate, tireless minority that is stirring up the troops. Now that irate minority its growing by leaps and bounds. Its going to continue to grow by leaps and bounds. And we will restore freedom to this country.

While Im a political atheist, I still vote, says Celente, who sees Campaign 2012 as little more than The Presidential Reality Show. While I dont agree with Ron Paul on all the issues, we are in lockstep when it comes to the need for an Intellectual Revolution.

And, its not only the US that needs radically new thinking to power it forward. As evidenced by their policies and actions … political leaders worldwide are afflicted by malignant forms of IDD, Intelligence Deficit Disorder. ""

As Gerald Celente wrote in the Winter 2012 Trends Journal, The choices are stark: Follow the leaders or change the course the future is in your hands; Renaissance or ruin.

When one country bombs another, which has not attacked it nor posed any immediate threat to it, that is an act of war. No ""humanitarian"" rationale justifies such an act. Only an act of Congress suffices according to the United States Constitution. Barack Obama has violated that provision of the United States Constitution, which he swore, falsely it is now apparent, to defend and protect. Barack Obama has committed this greatest of impeachable offenses. Other offenses related to torture and violation of the civil liberties of U. S. citizens may emerge as articles of impeachment are drawn up.

Many Tea Party candidates and paleo-conservative and libertarian Republicans, such as Rep. Ron Paul, won office by declaring their high regard for the Constitution. Rep. Paul stated in advance of the attack on Libya that a Congressional declaration of war was necessary according to the provisions of the Constitution before an assault could proceed. If these Republicans do not act now to begin impeachment following the lead of the very principled Dr. Paul, their words meant nothing, and they should be turned out of office.

Similarly antiwar liberals such as Dennis Kucinich backed candidate Barack Obama because of his promises of peace. But President Obama has given us ever more war. His pledge to end the war in Iraq by 2009 turns out to be an empty promise, and he has widened the war in Afghanistan. He has also ordered the bombing of Pakistan, another act of war not authorized by Congress. If such liberals are genuine agents of peace, they too have an obligation to follow the lead of Kucinich who has used the term impeachment with respect to Barack Obamas behavior to initiate impeachment proceedings. Otherwise they are poseurs, and they should be turned out of office.

Barack Obama can himself be called as the first witness to the hearings on his impeachment, so obvious is his crime. In 2008 as a candidate for the presidency he replied as follows to a question from the Boston Globes Charlie Savage.

Savage: ""In what circumstances, if any, would the president have constitutional authority to bomb Iran without seeking a use-of-force authorization from Congress?"" (Specifically, what about the strategic bombing of suspected nuclear sites  a situation that does not involve stopping an IMMINENT threat?)

Obama: ""The President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.""

High members of his administration agree and might provide ancillary testimony. Vice President Joseph Biden has declared: ""The Constitution is clear: except in response to an attack or the imminent threat of attack, only Congress may authorize war and the use of force."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was of the same opinion: ""If the country is under truly imminent threat of attack, of course the President must take appropriate action to defend us. At the same time, the Constitution requires Congress to authorize war. I do not believe that the President can take military action  including any kind of strategic bombing  against Iran without congressional authorization.""

Barack Obama has further isolated the U.S. in the world by going to war against Libya, contrary to his claims of being a part of a broad international effort. This can only do more damage to our country, bleeding now with so many problems. Consider the vote in UN Security Council. Michael Lind informs us of the demographics and power relationships lying behind the UN vote as follows: ""In the vote to authorize war against Libya, the U.S., Britain and France joined by Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, Gabon, Lebanon, Nigeria, Portugal and South Africa. Abstaining from the vote were five countries: Brazil, Russia, India, China and Germany.""

""What do the five countries that registered their opposition to the Libyan war have in common? They make up most of the great powers of the early twenty-first century. A few years back, Goldman Sachs identified the so-called ""BRICs""  Brazil, Russia, India and China  as the most important emerging countries in the world. The opponents of the Libyan war on the Security Council are the BRICs plus Germany, the most populous and richest country in Europe.""

""Including the United States, the Security Council nations that voted for the no-fly zone resolution have a combined population of a little more than 700 million people and a combined GDP, in terms of purchasing power parity, of roughly $20 trillion. The Security Council countries that showed their disapproval of the Libyan war by abstaining from the vote have a combined population of about 3 billion people and a GDP of around $21 trillion.""

""If the U.S. is factored out, the disproportion between the pro-war and anti-war camps on the Security Council is even more striking. The countries that abstained from the vote account for more than 40 percent of the human race. The countries that joined the U.S. in voting to authorize attacks on Libya, including Britain and France, have a combined population that adds up to a little more than 5 percent of the human race.""

The situation appears worse the more one regards it. Lebanons government controls only part of its territory. Gabon is a statelet with a mere 1.6 million people, smaller than many American cities. And the UN ambassadors of two of the countries who sided with the U.S., Nigeria and South Africa, were not present when the vote was scheduled to be taken. Ambassador Rice had to leave the Security Council chamber, find them and usher them in herself.

Partisan considerations should not impede the move to impeach Barack Obama. When George W. Bush was president, many on the Democratic Party Left called for his impeachment. They must do the same for President Obama who has more clearly violated the Constitution than President Bush since he did not even seek the dubious Congressional ""authorization"" which George W. Bush asked for and received. If the Left cannot do this, its credibility will be in shambles, and quite deservedly so. On the other side clearly there is reason to indict Bush, and some on the Left are calling for that as are certain authorities in European countries where the former President dare not go. But at the moment Barack Obama is in charge and capable of greater damage if he is not stopped by impeachment. Impeachment of Barack Obama can no longer be avoided.

President Barack Obama has violated the U.S. Constitution and employed the armed forces of the U.S. as a kings army. The U.S. made its revolution to escape such a predicament, and if this usurper of Congressional authority is not stopped and punished, these crimes will continue under each succeeding executive. This must end and it must end now. Impeachment proceedings must begin at once.

Ambac and MBIA are world leaders in providing financial guarantees and credit enhancements for bond issuers (e.g., municipalities), asset managers, financial institutions, and insurance companies. Both companies are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Holders of bonds and securities, ""insured"" by Ambac and MBIA, are provided irrevocable guarantees of timely payment of interest and principal should there be a default or other triggering event. Between the two companies, they guarantee more than $$1 trillion in municipal, corporate, and mortgage debt. A critical aspect of such guarantees pertains to the fact that Ambac’s and MBIA’s triple-A credit ratings are bestowed upon the bonds and securities they are insuring. This highest credit rating, correspondingly, signals to the market that such insured bonds and securities are of the highest quality and safety. Underpinning this uppermost credit rating, enjoyed by both Ambac and MBIA, is each company’s capital strength. Consequently, it would be reasonable to assume that directors and officers, of both companies, would view financial strength as sacrosanct. The dirty-little-secret, you won’t hear from Wall Street analysts, is that Ambac’s and MBIA’s top managements were knowingly weakening their respective company’s balance sheets just as they were aggressively expanding into structured finance. It is a fundamental tenet for insurers, sureties, and financial guarantors to put the interests of policyowners, beneficiaries, and obligees (i.e., customers) before shareholders. At Ambac and MBIA, this tenet was grossly violated.

These previously obscure companies are dominating the financial headlines as their names are now forever linked to the subprime-mortgage meltdown. These once staid municipal bond insurers aggressively expanded into guaranteeing collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which repackage assets such as mortgage bonds and buyout loans into new securities with varying risk. For these specialists, in risk assessment, to bestow triple-A ratings on what has turned out to be toxic junk simply defies all credit-underwriting principles. When the mortgage-lending industry was openly flaunting ""liars loans,"" low-doc loans, Alt-A loans, etc., how couldn’t it have been clear, to the executives at Ambac and MBIA, that mortgage underwriting standards had gone into the gutter? To turn around and place triple-A ratings on this financial debris is nothing short of financial alchemy; in which these two companies believed they had discovered a means of turning lead into gold. To be so cavalier indicates corporate cultures imbued with arrogance and selfishness.

Standard & Poor’s is reviewing $$534 billion worth of subprime-mortgage securities and CDOs for possible ratings downgrades. This is a staggering figure. For Ambac, MBIA, and other mono-line insurers to be so wildly off the mark is mind-numbing. Of course, this begs the question as to why anyone would ever again trust a triple-A-rated security insured by Ambac or MBIA? When a financial guarantor proves to be untrustworthy, it loses its franchise and cannot remain a viable business concern.

To date, both Ambac and MBIA have experienced horrific financial results in structured finance. For fiscal-year 2007, Ambac suffered a net loss of a little over $$3.2 billion while MBIA suffered a net loss of slightly over $$1.9 billion. When combining enormous losses with significant stock buybacks, in fiscal-year 2007, Ambac’s net worth declined by a whopping 63% (down to $$2,275,826,000) while MBIA’s declined by 49% (down to $$3,649,305,000). Thus, it is no wonder that Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s are reviewing these weakened companies for possible ratings downgrades. Fitch Ratings has already dropped Ambac to double-A and may do the same to MBIA.

To be sure, there are those who will argue that the aforementioned financial losses were not foreseeable. No management team willfully makes such flagrant strategic errors. In turn, the financial losses suffered by both companies most certainly should get the attention of shareholders but should not translate to a loss of trust in the marketplace. I have little doubt that Ambac’s and MBIA’s top executives are saying just that. Perhaps there is a smidgen of legitimacy to this argument.

When it comes to a breach of trust, however, both Ambac’s and MBIA’s executives have been caught red-handed. First let’s discuss the sacrosanct nature of protecting an insurer’s/financial guarantor’s capital strength. Here is what A.M. Best Company — the world leader in providing financial-strength ratings for insurance companies — has to say about capital strength:

The company’s capital and surplus are measured by the difference between its assets minus its liabilities. This value protects the interests of the company’s policyowners in the event it develops financial problems; the policyowners’ benefits are thus protected by the insurance company’s capital. Shareholders’ interest is second to that of policyowners.

Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Ambac’s and MBIA’s executives subordinated the interests of the beneficiaries — who depend upon each respective company’s financial guarantees — to those of the shareholders. This is an outright breach of trust, a dereliction of duty, and here’s how they did it.

From fiscal-year 2001 through the third quarter of 2007, Ambac and MBIA have been engaged in what can only be described now as reckless stock-buyback programs. Over this period of time, Ambac has repurchased $$1,015,036,000 worth of its common stock while MBIA has repurchased $$1,843,044,000 of its common stock. Wall Street, of course, always cheers on a stock buyback because it reduces the number of shares outstanding; which analysts foolishly believe enhances shareholder value (as explained here). The opposite, in fact, is true. A stock buyback weakens a company’s balance sheet and I have never understood why a weaker financial condition is better for a company and its shareholders.

So let’s put this into context for Ambac and MBIA. When a publicly-held company buys back its stock, such transactions can be easily tracked in the company’s financial statement. The first place to look, in the financial statement, is in the statement of cash flows. There you will see it as a use of cash categorized as a purchase of treasury stock. The next place to look is in the statement of changes in shareholders’ equity. There you will see treasury stock recorded as causing a decrease in total shareholders’ equity. So, in the name of enhancing shareholder value, Ambac and MBIA respectively spent $$1,015,036,000 and $$1,843,044,000 worth of cash for stock buybacks (over the past seven years). But, and now you know this, such cash expenditures reduced liquidity and net worth by those exact amounts. How can this be deemed responsible behavior when both companies are expressly in the business of insuring bonds and providing financial guarantees?

To add some more fuel to the fire, let’s fantasize for a moment and assume that both companies had responsible management teams who never would engage in stock buybacks. Well, Ambac’s net worth would be fully 44% higher than it is today while MBIA’s would be fully 50% higher. Accordingly, both companies would stand a better chance, of surviving the subprime meltdown, had their top executives been prudent financial managers. Shareholders, moreover, would certainly sleep better at night had such additional financial cushions existed in order to help their companies ride out these rough times.

And now, the New York state insurance superintendent is begging money-center banks to rescue these two train-wrecked companies. In a separate article, it is stated that ""A group of eight banks is already considering a plan to inject capital into Ambac, which needs at least $$1bn. Several banks are also believed to be talking to MBIA, which needs at least $$500m.""What a mess.

Ambac and MBIA, to say the least, are sorely missing the cash they used to repurchase their own shares. Indeed, this is the blowback management didn’t foresee when they put shareholders ahead of ""policyowners."" Such negligent behavior most certainly has opened the door for municipalities, regulators, and shareholders to file civil lawsuits against the directors and officers of Ambac and MBIA.

Hence, we have the ultimate irony here. You can bet that Ambac’s and MBIA’s directors and officers are praying that their directors & officers liability insurance carriers have been prudently managed so as to put policyowners ahead of shareholders. What a novel idea.

376415,"Several years ago, I composed an article entitled “Darth Greenspan” in which I compared former Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan to Hollywood’s greatest villain Darth Vader bringing attention to his early adherence to a gold based currency and the marketplace, later shifting his allegiance to central banking and centralized power. This article was far from a perfect analogy (as no analogy is perfect) yet many different parallels can be drawn between the Star Wars series and modern day America. In fact, after composing my original article, I began to notice more and more parallels and notice how clairvoyant producer George Lucas was, having scripted this epic story in the 1970s. Whether deliberate or not, George Lucas created a story that was once my childhood fantasy and is now my adult reality – especially as a student of Austrian economics.

To simplify this analogy, the theme shall be limited to the past 100 years beginning with the rise of Austrian economics led by Ludwig Von Mises in the early part of the twentieth century. As Ludwig Von Mises was so intellectually consistent and pure he can be compared to none other than the great Jedi Master Yoda, whose main role in the Star Wars series was to educate others and impart his knowledge of the force on to other Jedis. In the 1920s the Austrian economists were the world’s leading economists as they had accurately predicted so many events of that period. In Episode I of the 6 part series, The Jedi Council (Austrian economists) was respected all throughout the galaxy known for their mental purity, their opposition to the dark side (central banking), and their understanding of the force (the economy and the business cycle).

It was also during the early twentieth century when a central bank (a Sith lord) reappeared in America and the power of this institution began surreptitiously expanding its influence over the Republic. In Episode I, the Sith lord reappeared in the galaxy and it then became the top priority of the Jedi council to thwart the plans of Sith lord and destroy it as soon as possible because they knew how insidious the dark side of the force could become. The Sith lord and the dark side spread its influence behind the scenes by manipulating the political system just as central bankers and the creators of central banks did.

In Episode I, the Sith begins plotting his empire and building up military capabilities just as weapon production capability and military power in the U.S. also began expanding dramatically between 1910 and 1940. Simultaneously, the U.S. government introduced an income tax in 1913 allowing the government to expand its own power even moreso as government expansion boomed in the 1920s and 1930s. The Federal government’s militarism abroad also expanded significantly during this period as the nation began its blatant transition from republic to global empire. Although American citizens were very anti-imperialistic in the 1930s the attack on Pearl Harbor justified the intervention in Europe much like the assaults on planet Naboowhich “threatened the stability of the Republic” in Episode I and Episode II. Only subsequent to World War II, have U.S. Presidents been able to deploy soldiers abroad without Congressional approval – historically this was always the authority of kings and emperors.

It was also during the 1930s when the economic debate in Europe and the U.S. shifted from liberalism (led by Austrian economists) to inflationism and interventionism (led by John Maynard Keynes). Fittingly, Frederick Hayek can be compared to Mace Windu, as he was Yoda’s closest master on the Jedi council. Frederick Hayek and John Maynard Keynes were colleagues at the London School of Economics during the 1930s and they were fierce intellectual opponents on campus. In the early part of the decade Hayek’s name grew after his scathing and accurate critique of Keynes’ Treaties on Money. Later in the decade, Keynes published his magnum opus, The General Theory, which Hayek refrained from dissecting at the time.

Metaphorically, it was from this point on when Keynesianism began to dominate economic classrooms across the world, The General Theory became one of the best-selling economics books in history and Austrian economists were cast aside by the political establishment and the corporate controlled media. Shortly thereafter, WWII began and Ludwig Von Mises escaped Europe to America. As a Jew, Mises fled Europe out of fear of the Nazis whereas Yoda sought exile into a remote area of the galaxy out of fear of the new emperor.

Since WWII, The U.S. government has expanded its global military presence tenfold. In 2009:

“Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Dorothy Robyn referenced the Pentagon’s “507 permanent installations.” The Pentagon’s 2010 Base Structure Report, on the other hand, lists 4,999 total sites in the United States, its territories, and overseas. In the grand scheme of things, the actual numbers aren’t all that important. Whether the most accurate total is 900 bases, 1,000 bases or 1,100 posts in foreign lands, what’s undeniable is that the US military maintains, in Chalmers Johnson’s famous phrase, an empire of bases so large and shadowy that no one – not even at the Pentagon – really knows its full size and scope.” – The Nation. January 2011

Throughout the past 100 years, those within and closely surrounding the central banks have operated behind the scenes as did the sith lord and the dark side of the force throughout the story. In Episode III, if the Senate had known that they were under the control of a sith lord his quest for empire would have been foiled immediately.

Fortunately, the sith was never able to completely wipe out the Jedi. Mises (Yoda) and Rothbard (Obi Wan Kanobi) labored in obscurity propounding the principles of freedom, anti-imperialism and anti-inflationism and spreading these ideas on to others. Even though they were up against an enormous political machine where banks, military contractors and mega-corporations profited from the status quo and used all of their influence to maintain the status-quo they were determined to spread Austrian economics and were convinced that freedom was the only moral alternative to the welfare-warfare state.

In the 1970s another young Jedi emerged in the United States who was enamored by the writings of Austrian economists such as Rothbard and Mises. This young Jedi warrior was Ron Paul. In his life, Ron Paul spent a lot of time studying directly with Murray Rothbard and drove across Texas in 1971 during his lunch break just to meet Mises in person. Mises was 90 years old at the time and died 2 years later.

Luke Skywalker also took a sudden trip across the galaxy to see Master Yoda in his dying years in order to become a Jedi. Upon first meeting, Luke does not know who he’d met explaining that he is “looking for a great warrior”. Yoda laughs and replies “Wars not make one great.” Yoda and Mises were both humble and they constantly preached the evils of the dark side. Yoda emphasized that understanding the force should be used for good and that if lured in by the dark side the force could be used for evil.

If central bankers and their cronies are able to manipulate the economy and the business cycle through central banking they could exploit economic panics, which always lead to government expansion. Through central banking, the government can expand its military presence globally, by deficit financing and monetizing debt. Through central banking, the government can expand the government by secretly printing money when taxing and borrowing is not a popular option. Through central banking, cronies on Wall St can be bailed out after taking risky bets with their clients’ money. Through central banking, megabanks can grow larger and use those very profits to pay politicians to support policies that benefit banks. It is a self-sustaining structure. Manipulating the economy and the business cycle through central banking is the “secret” way to finance the growth of government and the path to empire – yet politicians and federal reserve employees prefer the euphemism “independence” rather than the word “secret”.

Federal Reserve employees do not traditionally attribute themselves for creating economic crises as this would be liable to invoke too much scrutiny around the dark bank but on rare occasions some insiders will go as far as admitting that low interest rates and easy credit do contribute to the boom part of the business cycle. Nonetheless, it is the elite private banking institutions with very close relationships to the Federal Reserve Bank that ultimately benefit from Federal Reserve policy, therefore if the heads of these banks fully understood the business cycle (“the force”) it would be profitable for them to exploit this knowledge of the force, and to join The Dark Side. It is easy to be drawn into the dark side because of the allure that it represents by increasing ones power.

In Episodes II and III, we begin to witness an inner-conflict arising within Anakin Skywalker who begins to lose confidence in their political system of democracy through elected officials and tells his new wife Padme that a more powerful figure should be empowered to make decisions for all, to circumvent the senate with “less deliberating and more action” – an early indication of his willingness to sacrifice principles for a “greater purpose”. In our modern-day political world, politicians and mainstream media pundits often justify the abandonment of principles or rights for the sake of some form of “greater good”. Throughout Episode III, Anakin’s new thirst for greater power becomes increasingly apparent which ultimately attracts him to the dark side. Central banks have complete monopoly control over money and credit, which has been the most sought after power for thousands of years. Chancellor Palpatine offers Anakin increased power, which is something that the Jedi Council would not grant him.

Episode III is when the republic officially transforms to an empire. Shortly before the official transformation, Padme asks Anakin:

“Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side? What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists? And the Republic has become the very evil we fought to destroy?”

Anakin denies this claim stating that Padme is beginning to sound like a “separatist” – someone not completely loyal to the republic. This has become very much the case in political discourse in modern-day America. When people deviate from the status-quo and challenge the political establishment, they are outcast as “un-American” or “on the fringe.” Anakin, like many Americans, falls blindly into the tricks and even believes Chancellor Palpatine when he accuses the Jedi of trying to overthrow the Republic.

On the floor of the Senate, Chancellor Palpatine accuses the Jedi of trying to assassinate him, as a direct attack on the republic, even though this was Palpatine’s plan all along. As a result of this planned attack, the Chancellor is now finally able to rule the galaxy in stating:

“In order to ensure the security and continuing stability, The Republic will be reorganized into the first galactic empire! For a safe and secure society!”

From inside the senate, Padme replies:

“So this is how liberty dies? With thunderous applause.”

This is the perennial theme during the growth of America’s federal government and continuously expanding empire – political leaders always justify this trend with false promises of safety and security. After the death of Mises and Rothbard, Ron Paul became one of the sole public voices propounding the value of liberty and rejecting the empire’s false image of government safety and security. For decades he battled the empire in solitude urging congress not to sacrifice freedom for a promise of security.

Even though Ron Paul used his knowledge of the force to predict the internet bubble and predict the housing bubble the empire was too strong and tightly knit for his predictions and knowledge of the force to be impactful enough to bring down the empire. Fortunately his predictions did gain much attention, comparable to when Luke Skywalker destroyed half of the death star in Episode IV, A New Hope. Since this time, Austrian economics and the Jedi’s place in the galaxy is what central banks fear most, so they will use all of their power to shut down the Jedi and maintain the empire. Historically, empires have always derived their power from control over others while shutting out any threats to the power structure, which is why many members of the political establishment (including media establishment) still deliberately dismiss Ron Paul and the resurgence of the Austrian Tradition.

In Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, Darth Vader and the emperor target Luke Skywalker and his growing rebel alliance in order to stifle any potential threats to the empire. Following the internet bubble bust and 911 attacks, the American empire exploited this opportunity to prevent future rebellion by passing “the patriot act” to suppress the people, creating TheDepartment of Homeland Security and launching pre-emptive attacks across the Middle East, followed by unmanned drone attacks across more and more of the globe.

Luke knew how powerful Darth Vader and the empire was so he began rigorous training in the ways of the force duringEpisode V, as did many students of Austrian economics over the past 10 years, who have grown so passionate and well educated in learning the Austrian tradition. With more and more people around the world studying Austrian economics and the business cycle we are well prepared to enter Episode VI, The Return of the Jedi.

The Austrian school of economics has resurfaced and is officially a major voice in the global battle of ideas. The above analogy is obviously imperfect which is why it is important to focus on the many similarities rather than the countless dissimilarities. What’s more, if one digs deeper into the six part movie, many more parallels can be drawn between the story and real world politics. For example, as the sith operates “behind the scenes”, a great book to download for understanding behind the scenes political maneuvering is called Tragedy and Hope, written by Harvard scholar and Bill Clinton’s closest professor at Georgetown, Carroll Quigley.

Unfortunately, Ron Paul does not own a light saber and if he did he is no longer as mobile as Luke Skywalker at this late stage of his life but he has surely been a great warrior in fighting for the cause of liberty. Moreover, a light saber battle with the head of The Federal Reserve Bank would not be enough to bring down the American empire and shift back in the direction of a freer society. However, educating more people in Austrian economics is a great real world solution for creating a genuine political change. I remain optimistic that the Jedis’ quest to restore balance in the galaxy can be achieved in our world and that good will conquer evil. Watching the circus in Washington DC or the grand scale theft at the Fed are not my source of optimism – however, I am most encouraged by our victories in the battle of ideas on the internet and the small political victories such as the recent and peaceful, grassroots revolution in Iceland.

For victory, knowledge of the force is only part of the challenge. Remaining relentless and stern in our principles is what allowed Luke Skywalker and the Jedi to ultimately restore the republic – resist the empire and the dark side. Spread the ideas of liberty far and wide.

""If you’re going to panic, do it fast and beat the crowd."" ~ Jesse Livermore

At last, Saturday I left the rehab center and returned home. It was quite a shock to return to the new homestead (I had only been living there 18 months). Being at rehab was quite an experience. I thought I had troubles. But after seeing the people at the rehab facilities, I learned better. Broken arms, broken legs, cracked skulls, people frozen with fear screaming jumbled words in the night, ancient women falling asleep over their dinners.

But the worst cases were damages connected with autos. Some people had been caught in crashes, others had been hit by cars. All suffered the awful results of shock. It was sad and even shocking to see these wrecked and broken bodies on muscle-building machines, as they tried to build up strength and repair their broken bodies. It seemed the average age of participants was about 70. At 87 I felt like a veteran.

I did have a lot of time to think while recuperating. In the last three and a half years I’ve had my share of troubles, including a stroke, an appendectomy and most recently the broken hip. They say that ""what ever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger."" Well, I’m still alive  so call me Hercules.

Here are a few of the things I’ve realized.

For 50 years all I had to write about was what was happening in the ""dear old USA."" What was happening overseas was inconsequential or somebody else’s worry. Today I receive a dozen newspapers, and the headlines in each one is different. Most of the headlines are about Europe, Asia, China or Greece. This for me, amounts to too much information. I can’t absorb it all, and I doubt if anybody else can. Britain turns down the Euro monetary union, or China’s inflation rate is discussed, or the rate of exports in Germany is highlighted. Worse, I learn that most US mortgage owners are ""under-water."" Meaning that their mortgage is greater than their equity in their home.

216752,"So those scurvy bums at Wal-Mart are finally getting what is coming to them! The state of Maryland will force all companies with more then 10,000 employees to spend at least 8 percent of their payroll on health insurance. Lots of companies have that many employees, but only one falls under the 8 percent threshold, which is you know who.

It is only the latest legislative blow dealt against the company that is finally accomplishing what everyone throughout all of human history dreamed of: plentiful food and goods available to all people in all places at low prices. What’s to complain about? This is the mystery that cries out for investigation.

That success breeds destructive attacks is part of business lore. A classic in modern libertarian literature, for example, is the poem “The Incredible Bread Machine” by R.W. Grant. It tells the story of Tom Smith, who invents a great machine to bake bread and package bread so cheaply that it could sell for less than a penny. “The first time yet the world well fed, And all because of Tom Smith’s bread.”

But then Tom Smith developed a problem: success. His bread was everywhere, and he was rich. But soon the public began to decry the Bread Trust, and regulation smashed his company. The last two stanzas:

Now bread is baked by government.

And as might be expected,

Everything is well controlled.

The Public well protected.

True, loaves cost a dollar each,

But our leaders do their best!

The selling price is half a cent…

Taxes pay the rest.

The key to the story is antitrust regulations pushed by business competitors and cheered on by an envious public ignorant of economics. It’s pretty much the same with Wal-Mart. Companies with whom Wal-Mart competes are only too happy in the short term to see the company get hammered for undercutting them on price. If you have been trying to fob off products for high prices for years — and these are essential to your profit margins — it must be torture to see Wal-Mart doing so well selling at a fraction of the old market price.

Herein lies not only the origin of antitrust but of vast numbers of business regulations. They are advocated by dominant firms that seek to impose harmful costs on smaller competitors (such as when Wal-Mart itself was pushing for a higher minimum wage) or by smaller firms that hope to impose punishing costs on more successful firms. The notion that these regulations are designed to benefit the public is just the ideological junk-food that is fed to Congressional committees and the general public.

The way to address this problem is for the state to cease to offer business the chance to unfairly compete in this way. If there were no regulations and no antitrust laws, businesses would not face the near-occasion of sin to use government as a way to clobber its enemies. They would face no choice but to innovate, cut costs, and serve consumers better than the other guy.

Much more troubling and mysterious are public attitudes. Wal-Mart was made successful because people like buying there. They like the prices and convenience. The public could bankrupt the company in a matter of weeks simply by failing to show up to make purchases. People are free to do so. That’s the way the market works.

Maybe you hate Wal-Mart. Fine. Don’t shop there. What’s so hard to understand about that?

Why would the same people who enjoy the fruits of Wal-Mart’s entrepreneurship also celebrate laws that harm the company? They believe that they can have their cake and eat it too. There is a lack of economic understanding in operation here. They have failed to understand that one of the reasons Wal-Mart can offer such good deals is that they are running an efficient enterprise.

But does it not come at the expense of the labor force? Of course all workers want raises in all forms, just as all consumers want products and services to be available at the lowest price. These are conflicting demands. At some point in the scale of wages and prices, the tradeoff between the two demands finds a clearing point. What that point is cannot be worked out by a central planner. It has to be discovered by the market.

The moral import of the market is its non-coercive core. The workers who work at Wal-Mart would rather be doing that than any other activity that is open to them. So too for the shoppers. It is the matrix of exchange that has made Wal-Mart a success. No one, unlike with government, has a gun pointed at his head. Everyone is making a non-coerced choice in favor of exchanging as versus not exchanging. Everyone benefits.

Does that seem elementary to you? Then you understand something that most sociologists, literary scholars, news commentators, preachers, and government officials apparently do not understand. You understand that mutually beneficial exchange is the building block of civilization itself.

You probably also understand that this law is not going to be good for Maryland. Fewer Wal-Marts will start up in that state than otherwise would. A legal climate hostile to business will deter future businesses from locating there. Some businesses may leave. Also, a less competitive environment for business will mean higher prices and less consumer choice. And why? So that Wal-Mart’s competition can thrive on an inefficient business model. This law, then, rewards waste and punishes efficiency.

Now, there is a further complication in this case. A main complaint against Wal-Mart’s wage policies is that its employees were draining too much from the state’s Medicaid budget. This is an interesting point. Is it possible that Wal-Mart was, in effect, free riding off the taxpayers? Would it then be better just to roll those costs onto the back of the company itself? There is a superficial logic at work here, but it is the logic that leads to all-out business regimentation.

It is doubtful that in a truly free market business would normally provide any health benefits at all, any more than they provide you shoes, movie tickets, or scotch delivered to your door. These are things that you buy on your own. Medical benefits tied to employment originated as a scheme to get around government wage controls.

If the Medicaid free ride is a problem, there is a more direct solution. Get rid of this program too. What we need are Wal-Marts in the medical industry too, firms that provide great services at low prices. But they won’t come about until we rid ourselves of the subsidies attached to public provision.

Meanwhile, the Incredible Stuff Machine will pay and pay for all the glorious things it has brought the world population, and the ignorant among us will clamor for the machine to be destroyed. Then the only big companies will be those created, run, and subsidized by the government.

The Unites States, an alleged “superpower,” is not capable of putting its own spy satellites into space. The “superpower” is dependent on Russia, which provides the “superpower” with the rocket engines to put up spy satellites to spy on Russia!!!

It seems Russia is more interested in US dollars and “cooperation with Washington” than in national survival.

Little wonder the neoconservatives believe that Putin will acquiesce in Russia’s demise at Washington’s hands.

Washington’s New World Order of tyranny toward all seems safely on course. Russia is enabling Washington’s dominance by putting Washington’s spy satellites in space for Washington.

Perhaps next Russia will provide Washington with the location of all its nuclear-armed submarines and the movement schedule of its train track-based ICBMs. Why not if it ensures “cooperation with Washington,” apparently the Russian government’s only goal.

Isn’t it amazing. Washington imposes sanction package after sanction package on Russia, and Putin continues to sell Washington the rocket engines it needs to send up its spy satellites!!!!!

God help the Russians.

221589,"by Scott Lazarowitz Reason and Jest

Recently by Scott Lazarowitz: I Fear the Government and the Obedient Sheeple, More Than I Fear Guns

It appears that one of Boston’s two commercial all-talk radio stations is being closed down and replaced by another music station. WTKK 96.9 FM, “NewsTalk Ninety-Six Nine,” will cease to be, tomorrow. Last August, Boston’s until-then third all-talk radio station, “Talk 1200,” also ceased to be, and became an all-comedy radio station. The joke’s on us talk radio listeners, though. Now we’re down to just WRKO, which has local hosts Jeffrey Kuhner and Howie Carr, and syndicated hosts Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin, for commercial talk radio. But public radio stations WBUR and WGBH are heavy in news and talk, and provide a needed alternative.

I am not surprised with WTKK’s expiring, given the decline in talk radio in general over the last 20 years, and the decline in our culture that used to appreciate a diversity in points of view. But nowadays, the Left, which controls the government education system, doesn’t even want to consider or hear other points of views, and the neocons, who mainly have ruled over talk radio since the early 1990s, also don’t want to hear other points of view, as both sides remain ignorant and closed-minded.

So now, only a small portion of the population listens to talk radio, because it’s no longer very informative or entertaining, and only a small portion listens to NPR or watches TV news or cable talk/news. Mostly people turn on the radio to hear the crappy music that is now offered, and watch boring crap on TV. America is now a nation of unthinking, texting zombies, who vote for corrupt political sleazebags like Barack Obama and Willard Romney, and show contempt for truth-tellers such as Ron Paul.

But I’ve been a talk radio junkie since the 1970s, beginning with Mike Miller on WTIC in Hartford, Bernard Meltzer and Arlene Francis on WOR and Larry Glick on WBZ. Larry Glick took calls from people in many different states, as WBZ’s reach is quite wide, and Glick talked about the “light” topics and was very funny. Arlene Francis had a wider variety, discussing political issues as well as interviewing celebrities. While Meltzer didn’t discuss politics — his was sort of an advice show — he nevertheless cracked me up with his addressing the callers as “honey,” and “sweetheart.” Today he would be called a “sexist” for that. And Pegeen Fitzgerald and her husband Edward were also on WOR, broadcasting from their apartment that also included sounds of the cleaning lady vacuuming in the background, and their gossiping about the neighbors and bickering. What fun they were, the Fitzgeralds.

But it was really Jerry Williams who got me much more interested in the issues and current events. His show on WRKO during the 1980s was #1 in Boston radio for several years, as were most of the other shows on WRKO. Here is the website devoted to Jerry Williams, who died in 2003.

Jerry Williams’s background was in theater and acting, and he had an extremely diverse palette of interests of his to discuss. He interviewed many people from politics and show biz, and the arts and sciences. I don’t think there has been a talk radio talent as good as Jerry Williams. He was an old-fashioned, pro-union, pro-choice “liberal,” who became more populist in the later years of his show, thanks to the corruption of Gov. Michael Dukakis, the New Braintree prison deal, and the rise in tax-thefts in Massachusetts. Starting in 1994, Williams gradually reduced his hours on WRKO, and then fully retired in 1998. He made a brief comeback in December 2002 on WROL in Boston, and then, prior to his death in April 2003, had a “last hurrah” on WRKO on March 1st, 2003.

I kind of hadn’t been as enthusiastic in listening to Jerry Williams maybe starting in the early 1990s, as he seemed to have become obsessed with the seat-belt law and repealing it, and his discussions of the state political “hacks” were endless. In other words, he was becoming a little boring.

And with WRKO’s decline starting around 20 years ago, I would say that the decline of talk radio in general started around then, too. The cultural decline since the early ’90s is related to that. The 1980s gave us Iran-Contra and the Nazi-wannabe Oliver North plotting his future police state, and then the Cold War came to a close. So with those things then-President George H.W. Bush started his war on Iraq to keep the military-industrial-congressional-security-complex going. But no one seemed to question any of that. Bush managed to whine his way to the UN to get that collection of dictators, war criminals, misfits and degenerates to go along with Bush’s Iraq. But thanks to the decline in education in America, the decline in critical thinking, and the increase in State-worship authoritarianism, the American people didn’t question the propaganda.

Since the 1990s, talk radio has been dominated by the neocons. Rush Limbaugh really became popular thanks to Bill Clinton, the Left’s own Teflon President. And now, when you listen to the average talk radio program, you will hear the host spending long segments talking just by himself, and when they finally do take calls, usually it is fellow neocons agreeing with one another and patting themselves on the back in blindly supporting the military and the “war on terror,” and hating Muslims and immigrants. Basically that’s it now. No wonder their ratings continue to decline.

But if you compare the average hour of talk radio now with discussions that talk radio hosts had during the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s, you’ll hear a big difference, not just in the diversity of points of view and the talk hosts’ allowing that diversity, but the quality of conversations was much higher then than it is now. For example, you can hear Jerry Williams’s 1965 WBBM interview of well-known atheist Madeline Murray O’Hare (before the O’Hare), who discussed the Supreme Court’s ruling on prayer in public schools and how she had been beaten by the police (interviews are at the end of that linked post).

Or you can hear Jerry Williams interviewing John McLaughlin on WBZ (who later hosted the “McLaughlin Group” on TV) in 1974 while McLaughlin was still a Jesuit priest and working as a Nixon Administration flunky. I think that link is the second hour of the discussion, which is provided by the JerryWilliams.org website. Here is the following hour. (Links open a new media player window.)

And here is a 1972 Jerry Williams interview of then-Democrat Presidential nominee George McGovern. I don’t think they took calls from listeners, but it is an interesting discussion.

And here is Jerry Williams’s 1967 discussion of Jack Ruby’s death and the Warren Commission, from WBBM.

And here is a 1970 interview by Jerry Williams of controversial investment advisor Richard Ney, here and here.

And here is a four-minute audio clip from the early 1970s with Jerry Williams taking a call from a frustrated Marine, who stated that we the people needed to take our country back from the liars who rule over us. Not much has changed since 40 years ago, I’m afraid.

There are some clips from WRKO provided on the JerryWilliams.org website, but they do not seem to be as good as all the shows I remember hearing on WRKO throughout the 1980s.

There have been plenty of times that I have turned on the radio, wishing that Jerry Williams was still on, because on WRKO at that afternoon hour is Howie Carr, who replaced Jerry Williams in 1994. Howie Carr is still on! Some people had already been predicting that WRKO is also on its way to changing formats, as its ratings have also been very poor. Oh well, “Entercom happens,” as Carr would say.

Now, WBZ is considered an “all-news” station, and has good ratings. But from 8 PM until 5 AM they do have talk shows. I suppose former WBZ-TV reporter Dan Rea is okay as the evening WBZ talk host, but you can only hear the Registrar of Motor Vehicles so many times, you know. (It seems every time I tune in, he has the Registrar of Motor Vehicle on.)

But regarding WBZ’s evening talk hosts, Rea replaced the funny and politically-observant Paul Sullivan, who died in 2007 at the age of only 50, and Paul Sullivan replaced the libertarian intellectual David Brudnoy, who died in 2004 at the age of only 64. And even Brudnoy had replaced Lou Marcel, who died at an even younger age. (Hmmm. Could there be something wrong there at the WBZ studios? Also, WBZ radio news anchor Darrell Gould died in 1996 at age 56.)

But early deaths do not seem to be reserved for WBZ, as WRKO talk host Andy Moes died at only age 50 back in 2001. Perhaps there’s something going on with radio electronics or radio waves etc., I don’t know. However, some talk radio hosts still seem to have very good endurance, regardless of what might be going on in those radio studios. Howie Carr, 60, continues on WRKO for 18 years despite the health issues he’s had, and Rush Limbaugh, almost 62, continues his syndicated show of 24 years despite his health issues.

And Jerry Williams was a talk radio host from 1957 until 1998. Now that’s endurance. But how much longer will talk radio itself last, as long as we have a country lacking in critical thinking, and a population of zombies who constantly hold and stare at their cell phones like a second sex organ?

But there still seems to be hope for us, and for talk radio. Despite the neocons and progressives and the biased news media‘s attempts at suppressing Ron Paul’s message of freedom and peace this past year, those ideas have been making their way back into talk radio. Investment and monetary analyst Peter Schiff has his new show which is live 10 AM-Noon Eastern, and can be heard on several radio stations (although quite a few of those stations air only the rebroadcast of the show on weekends).

And economic historian Tom Woods fills in for Schiff quite a lot. Now, Woods is the one, in my opinion, who has the kind of communications and conversational talent and abilities to carry on a great talk radio show. If we can just get the Left-progressives and neocons to try to open their minds a little more to the moral principles of individual rights and non-aggression, and get them to step back and see that the State is not really what it and its handlers present it to be, then maybe Woods and others can rejuvenate the talk radio medium, and make it better again.

And if we can only get the zombies all across America to put down those damn cell phones!

Walter Szulc Jrs first experience in a kayak was enough to deter even the bravest as his quiet maiden voyage in the one-man canoe resulted in him being stalked by one of the sea’s most dangerous predators.

Shocked beachgoers on Nauset Beach near Cape Cod were lining the beach screaming shark, shark to attempt to warn him  but he failed to hear them.

Jaws: Walter Szulc Jr., left, is caught on camera the moment he looks back to discover the dorsal fin of a great white shark edging closer

The great white shark was estimated at 12-14ft and was seen less than 100ft out in the water when it appeared behind Mr Szulc.

Onlookers desperately tried to get his attention to get him back to the beach.

One witness said: There were hundreds of people on the beach, and they were all at the edge, yelling paddle, paddle, paddle!

Safely on dry land Mr Szulc said he had not heard the warnings and had no idea there was a shark behind him until he was close to shore.

The moment he turns around to see the sharks fin closing up on him was caught by a bystander.

I looked behind me and that’s when I saw the shark, it was pretty much right there.

735900,"Yesterday, we talked about muscle-building supplements. And while that’s a big market full of dubious claims, nothing can compare to the marketing chicanery of male virility/sexuality boosters.

There are supplements out there that promise to increase your libido while also upping your testosterone. And there are supplements that market themselves as T-boosters, while also touting themselves as an aphrodisiac. And then there are companies that claim to have developed a pill that contains the triumvirate of male-enhancing properties: T-boosting, libido-enhancing, and even fertility-increasing. These supplement makers sometimes throw in an additional claim of muscle gain as well.

For guys who are mainly looking to increase their testosterone, these extra benefits can seem like the icing on the cake, which makes these supplements highly marketable. But when it comes to actually boosting T, do they NOW Maca 500mg, 250 Ve... Buy New $$12.49 (as of 03:15 EST - Details) really work?

The Libido Paradox

Supplements that tout themselves foremost as libido enhancers make up the majority of the market for testosterone boosters. But most don’t have any effect on testosterone levels. So why do people buy them like crazy?

Simple: you think they’re working.

When your testosterone levels go up, so does your libido. Unfortunately, the inverse is not true — your libido levels can go up without your testosterone levels also going up. And that’s how most supposed T-boosters “work”: they make you feel ornery, leading you to think that your T levels are appreciably higher, when they actually aren’t. In rare cases, supplementation will result in a 20% testosterone increase. This kind of improvement may sound impressive, but is irrelevant for practical purposes.

If you treat these supplements for what they are (libido boosters), you may be happy with the results.

Can I boost my testosterone or not?

Legitimate, working testosterone boosters do exist, but they’re not very exciting. They’re not life-changing because, at most, they’ll increase testosterone levels by 20-50%. Compare that to a low-dose steroid cycle, which offers a 300% increase minimum.

You may not be able to tell whether or not a supplement is working without getting a blood test. Even then, blood tests only take your T levels at that exact moment, which can fluctuate based on a lot of different variables. Bottom line: it’s easy to promise a testosterone boost when very few people are actually checking their testosterone levels.

Below we offer a breakdown of the most popular testosterone boosters out there and an assessment as to their effectiveness.

A Breakdown of the Most Popular Testosterone Boosters

Tribulus Terrestris

Tribulus terrestris is the #1 selling testosterone booster, and the best example of a supplement that increases libido, but has no effect on testosterone.

Anecdotally (and traditionally, in East Asia), it’s worked well for men seeking to increase their confidence and libido, but studies have not confirmed this kind of effect. While preliminary evidence suggests that Tribulus can protect the body from stress, it definitely has no effect on testosterone.

D-Aspartic Acid

D-Aspartic Acid (D-AA) catapulted into the spotlight after a study showed supplementing D-AA could increase testosterone up to 42% after just 12 days. This sparked a frenzy of D-AA supplementation. Within a week, people were reporting greatly increased libido, as well as increased testicle size. NOW Vitamin D-3 5,000 ... Buy New $$10.88 (as of 03:55 EST - Details)

Unfortunately, another study done that spanned a longer time period found that after about a month of D-AA supplementation, testosterone levels returned to normal. A month isn’t long enough for elevated testosterone levels to have an effect on muscle growth and development.

D-AA has been found to provide increased fertility and testosterone when supplemented by infertile men, but it has no effect on athletes and people with normal testosterone levels.

Zinc and Magnesium

Zinc and magnesium (both part of the ZMA formula) are frequently recommended as testosterone boosters for athletes. These minerals are lost through sweat and during exercise.

If you’re deficient, supplementing with zinc or magnesium can take your testosterone levels to your normal baseline. Additional zinc or magnesium will not increase testosterone above normal levels.

DIGG THIS

""Funny

money,"" commented a visitor in our earshot at the Chase Manhattan

Bank Museum of Moneys of the World in New York Rockefeller Center.

The visitor, a Texan we surmised from his drawl, height, and wide-brim

Stetson, was referring to a display of Yap stone money. One Yap

specimen measures some thirty inches in diameter and weighs about

175 pounds. It is worth ten thousand coconuts or one wife, or so

the sign read.

Funny money

is right, we mused, but not for the reason that seemed to catch

the eye of most of the sightseers and what we guessed were a few

stray numismatists. They were fascinated by the bizarre in money:

the tiny gold coin, little bigger than a pinhead, from India; the

large copper coin weighing 31 pounds from Sweden; the Joachimsthaler

coin minted about 1520 in Bohemia, the ancestor of the American

""thaler"" or, later, dollar; the ""genuine"" American

wooden nickels; money old and new, money in big denominations and

small, money in assorted shapes and materials, money

made of metal and paper of course but also made of salt, of grain,

of fishhooks, of musket balls, of cacao seeds, of brick tea, even

of woodpecker scalps.

Still, what

intrigued us was the evidence of inflation demonstrated by the museum’s

better than 75,000 specimens of ancient and modern money. Some fifty

centuries of inflation, we’d say. The progressive and quite unrelenting

disappearance of silver in the content of the denarius coin of Rome

(the penny of the New Testament) for example. (Thinning out the

silver content leads inexorably, we figured, to the multiplication

of volume of money and its loss of value. This is the way with inflation

— multiplication is what is sought under the theory that money

is wealth but it is division that, unintentionally, results.)

At any rate,

according to a reference work we found in the museum, the denarius

issued by Augustus was, save for a bit of hardening alloy, pure

silver — i.e., its silver content was practically 100 per cent.

Yet by Nero, in 54 A.D., the silver content of the denarius had

slipped to 94 per cent; by Vitellius, in 68 A.D, to 81 per cent.

By Domitian, in 81 A.D., it had climbed to 92 per cent; by Trajan,

98 A.D., up another notch to 93 per cent; but by Hadrian, 117 A.D.,

it had again wended its way down, to 87 per cent; by Antoninus Pius,

138 A.D., to 75 per cent; by Marcus Aurelius, 161 A.D., to 88 per

cent; by Septimius Severus, 193 A.D., to 50 per cent; by Elagabalus,

218 A.D., to 43 per cent; by Alexander Severus, 222 A.D., to 35

per cent; by Gordian, 238 A.D., to 28 per cent; by Philip, 244 A.D.,

to 0.5 per cent; and by Claudius Victorinus, 268 A.D., to 0.02 per

cent. Then came Diocletian’s famous answer to inflation, his price-fixing

edict of 301 A.D., replete with very sharp teeth for price-breakers.

It didn’t work; inflation persisted. And anyway, Rome was out of

business before long.

Not So Sterling

So much for

the Roman penny. What of the English penny, originally struck of

sterling silver? It is the same sad tale. Another reference work

at the museum bespoke of the same trend of decline of silver content.

For King John, of Magna Carta fame, the English penny (for which

the British today still use the symbol ""d,"" referring

to the time Britain was under Rome when ""d"" stood for

denarius) contained 22.5 grains troy of silver. But by Edward I,

1275 A.D., silver content was down to 22 grains; by Edward III,

to eighteen grains; by Henry IV, 1412 A.D., to fifteen grains; by

Edward IV, 1464 A.D., to twelve grains; by Henry VIII, 1526 A.D.,

to eleven grains; in 1544, still under Henry VIII, to ten grains;

by Elizabeth I, 1560 A.D., to eight grains; in 1601 A.D., still

under Elizabeth I, to 7.8 grains; and by George III, 1790 A.D.,

to 7.3 grains. To sum up English inflation, it might be pointed

out that the London price of gold from 1250 A.D. to 1950 A.D. rose

from seventeen shillings per fine ounce to 250 shillings per fine

ounce. The persistent shrinkage of silver content in the English

pound sterling, from literally a pound of silver to but a fraction

of a pound today, we also noted.

Blame Herr

Gutenberg

But the museum

bespeaks a dichotomy of inflation: metal and paper. The split harks

back to the invention of movable type (circa 1440 AD.), Herr Johann

Gutenberg’s gift to money-making machines, legal and illegal, which

made previous inflation techniques — alloying, clipping, sweating,

over-stamping, and so on — appear crude and amateurish. After Gutenberg

a simple order in the dead of night, in any tongue, ""Psst.

Roll ’em!"" to the fellow at the mint, and a beautiful stream

of newly printed currency would issue forth, endlessly, or so it

seemed.

Plenty of

evidence of paper money inflation is on display at the museum. John

Law’s ""Mississippi Bubble"" money. American Continentals

of the American Revolution (""Not worth a Continental"").

Assignats and mandats of the French Revolution. A Chinese 500,000

yuan note (1947 A.D.), quite irredeemable. A German 100 billion

mark Reichsbanknote (1924 A.D.), which some Germans used for wallpaper.

A Greek one-trillion drachma note (1944 A.D.). A Hungarian one hundred

quintillion pengo note (1946 A.D.) — that’s twenty ciphers or 100,000,000,000,000,000,000

pengoes, worth at the time less than one U.S. cent. It’s all a bit

embarrassing, this bearing witness to monetary hanky-panky in glass

cases.

The Shrinking

Franc

The Texan

circled our way again. ""Get a load of the figure on this money,""

he said to his companion as they stood before the Hungarian note.

""Just like the prices I paid in Paris."" He mentioned six

hundred francs for a shave and haircut, fifty-five hundred francs

for a room and bath, and ""ten grand for a night on the town.""

He pushed his Stetson to the back of his head. ""You need one

of those IBM machines to figure out where you stand after a week

in Paris,"" he said. He also mentioned that the ""spenders""

in Washington could learn something from their Parisian counterparts;

in Paris, he explained, public budgets are not measured in billions

but in trillions.

The talk jibed

with the French francs on exhibit. The 1914 franc officially exchanged

at five to the dollar. The 1945 franc, however, could be had at

fifty to the dollar. Between the two World Wars, in other words,

the franc shrank from twenty cents in worth to two cents, a 90 per

cent loss in purchasing power for French citizens. But today’s franc

exchanges for just under five hundred to the dollar, a 90 per cent

loss compounded on a 90 per cent loss. The franc has sunk to a worth

of one-fifth of a U.S. cent (and the U.S. cent, too, is no longer

what it used to be). But the descent of the French franc will be

reversed — voil — by fiat effective January 1, 1960.

On and after that date only ""heavy"" francs will circulate.

A new ""heavy"" franc is equal to one hundred ""old""

francs. ""Heavy"" francs ease calculation and presumably

return some prestige to the franc. Some ""heavy"" francs

are already in circulation, and we asked a museum official if Chase

Manhattan had one we could see. It did, a one thousand franc note

issued by the Banque de France, with the usual fine engraving, heroic

pictures, and multi-colors of French currency but over stamped in

red ink CONTRE-VALEUR DE 10 NOUVEAUX FRANC. We wondered when a heavy

""heavy"" franc would go on display.

For a theory

of inflation hit us as we poked around the museum, the theory that

inflation is more than a peculiar way of life — it’s a law of life.

The ancient Babylonians and Greeks inflated; the modern Brazilians

and Soviets inflate. Inflation, like sin, is always with us. Every

money in every age, we reflected, inevitably undergoes inflation — a

multiplication of volume and a division in value — sometimes at a

crawl, sometimes at a gallop, but progressive inflation nonetheless.

The Evaporating

Dollar

In retrospect,

the French franc has been galloping, and relatively, the American

dollar has been crawling. Yet the crawl has been fast enough. We

looked at a glass-enclosed Federal Reserve note in the amount of

ten thousand dollars, Series 1934. In 1934 that note bought ten

thousand dollars worth of goods and services. But now that same

note buys just about four thousand dollars of goods and services.

Poof! It’s gone — six thousand dollars of lost purchasing power.

So that’s our new-found law of money; money multiplies in volume

and divides in value over the years. Money, like water, evaporates

over the hot sands of time.

But why inflation?

We scanned the exhibits once more for clues to the why of what was

plainly becoming Peterson’s Law of Inflation. Perhaps we found one.

Whether paper or metal, on each currency unit we confronted symbols

of government.

A royal picture,

a crown, a flag, a national emblem, a finance minister’s signature,

and on the paper money the frequent phrase, ""The Government

of . . . will pay to the bearer on demand…"" But pay what?

Not gold — that went out with rumble seats. Pay only less and

less, according to Peterson’s Law. But could governments be at the

root of the problem? If so, what is it in the nature of government

that makes it partner to inflation? Historically, we thought, governments

have been the big spenders and debtors. And it’s well known that

debtors are not usually averse to borrowing dear and repaying cheap.

For example, a couple of millennia ago Dionysius of debt-ridden

Syracuse astutely called in all drachma coins of Syracusean issue,

doubled their face value by over-stamp, and used half of the new

coins to discharge the public debt with a handsome 50 per cent profit.

It’s plain

the record of governments and their trusteeship over money gives

one no great feeling of trust. As Harry Sherman, board chairman

of the Book-of-the-Month Club, sums up his study of promises by

governments to pay up their debts honestly and of government monetary

management in general (The Promises Men Live By, p. 362):

""Government, it might be said, is the one area of human activity

that constitutes the last stronghold of scoundrelism in human nature.""

But still,

would governments consciously inflate against their own citizens?

The thought was too dismal, the theory too disconcerting. We never

got to check out the connection, if any, between inflation and public

debts, for we left the Museum of Moneys of the World — that

monetary graveyard — for the purer air and traffic of New York’s

Sixth Avenue and fished in our pockets for a fifteen cent subway

token to take a ride that had cost a nickel not so long ago.*

As there are uses and abuses, by commission and omission, of history, theology, sociology, psychology, etc., in the service of ideology and politics, so also there are uses and abuses by commission and omission of religious liturgy for the same purposes. Just in case your Palm Sunday and Holy Week liturgies do not communicate it clearly, or just in case your priest, minister, bishop, preacher or pastor do not tell you it from the pulpit, Palm Sunday and Holy Week are 100% about the victorious and salvific Nonviolent Coming of God into His Nonviolent Kingdom through the Nonviolent Messiah Jesus.

The Palm Sunday narrative of Jesus entering Jerusalem on a donkey is recorded in all four Gospels, which means it is highly probable that it is based on an historical event. But, Jesus has journeyed to Jerusalem on foot from Galilee, why then does He choose to complete His journey by riding into Jerusalem on a donkey? There is no serious scholarly doubt that by this gesture He is symbolically referencing Himself and His mission to Zechariah 9:9–10. There is also no serious scholarly doubt that the Apostolic communities as evidenced by the Four Evangelists were well aware of this and understood its importance to the proper proclamation of the Gospel in general, and in particular to the center piece of the Gospel, the Passion Narrative. Zechariah 9:9–10 announces:

""Rejoice heart and soul, daughter of Zion, shout with gladness, daughter of Jerusalem! See now your king comes to you; he is victorious, he is triumphant, Meek and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey. He will banish chariots from Ephraim and horses from Jerusalem; The bow of war will be banished. he will proclaim peace for the nations. His kingdom shall stretch from sea to sea, from the River to the ends of the earth.""

It is as certain that the manner of Jesus' entrance into Jerusalem is meant to be a direct reference to this prophetic passage in Zechariah, as it is certain that Jesus' words on the cross, ""My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?"", are a direct reference to Psalm 22, which opens with these words. But look at the words of Zechariah 9:9–10: ""meek,"" banishing ""chariots and horses."" Chariots and horses are the equivalent in Jesus' time of today's Stealth bombers and nuclear missiles: the maximal destructive technology of the hour. Again look at the words, this victorious king of Zechariah 9:9–10 will proclaim ""peace"" and his kingdom, which shall stretch ""from the River (Jordan) to the ends of the earth,"" will be completely without arms, the instruments of human destruction, ""the bow of war.""

This unambiguous Nonviolent Palm Sunday entrance into Jerusalem is the beginning of the end of Jesus' journey of Nonviolent Love of friends and enemies for the salvation of all people. Contrary to popular piety, it is not be merely a ""via dolorosa,"" a way of suffering. Identification with Jesus suffering is identification with Jesus loving. His via dolorosa is a Way of suffering chosen in order to confront and conquer evil in a sin-drenched world, not suffering chosen for its own sake or for the sake of placating an unforgiving, ""eye for eye,"" revengeful, terrorist deity. Jesus via dolorosa is the choice of the Way of nonviolent suffering love of friends and enemies made in order to embody and make visible God's Nonviolent Love for all — even for lethal enemies, e.g., the healing of the ear of the armed servant of the high priest who comes to Gethsemane to take Jesus to His death, ""Father forgive them for they know not what they do."" The Nonviolent King, who enters Jerusalem on a donkey in fulfillment of Zechariah 9:9–10, ultimately receives the stature prophesied for Him when crowned with thorns by those He loves to the end, He mounts His throne — the Cross of Nonviolent Love — and has, by order of Pilate, the ruling Roman official of this kingdom of the world at the time, a sign written in three languages, placed above His head on His throne: ""King of the Jews.""

For the Nonviolent Jesus there is a direct route from His Sermon on the Mount, to His Nonviolent symbolic announcement of the Coming of the Reign of the Nonviolent God of Love on Palm Sunday, to His unequivocal incarnation of that God on Good Friday, to the incontestable validation of the reality, power and wisdom of that God on Easter Sunday. Take the Nonviolent Jesus of Nonviolent Love of friends and enemies out of Palm Sunday, out of Good Friday, out of Easter Sunday and there is no Palm Sunday, no Good Friday, no Easter Sunday. Nonviolent Love of friends and enemies is integral to the very meaning and purpose of those days.

Take the Nonviolent Love of friends and enemies of Jesus out of Holy Week and there is no Holy Week. There is no ""Holy"" in the week, because God, the Holy One, is love (agape). Without Jesus enfleshment of Divine Nonviolent Love toward all — friends and enemies, faithful followers and betrayers — there is just a week of unholy, diabolical brutality, violence, torture, cruelty, injustice, suffering and death. Why? Again, only God is Holy and God is agapeic love. Jesus, the Word (Logos) of God, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity is the incarnation of Nonviolent Love toward all because God is Nonviolent Love toward all. The Father and Jesus are one, consubstantial. The person who sees Jesus sees the Father. Jesus comes to do the Father's will and only the Father's will. Starting on Palm Sunday, continuing through Good Friday and on to Easter Sunday, it is the Nonviolent Love of Jesus, God incarnate, that makes this week Holy — and I might add, makes it an efficacious moment in the long process of exposing and conquering evil.

If this were a week of remembering a Jesus entering Jerusalem in a warrior's chariot — surrounded with manned war horses and a legion of soldiers carrying the most advanced killing technology of the time and ready to immediately kill other human beings on Jesus' command — it would not be the beginning of a Holy Week. A Jesus telling Peter to ""finish off"" the armed servant of the high priest, after Peter slashes his ear off, would not make for a Holy Week. A week in which Jesus calls down from the cross curses and retribution on those who are killing Him would not be a Holy Week. A week that ends with a body corrupting in a tomb after a life of nonviolent love of friends and enemies would not be a Holy Week. It is the Nonviolent Love of friends and enemies enfleshed unto death in the now risen Jesus — the Word, the Way and the Truth of God who is love — that makes this week Holy.

The events and revelations of Holy Week unto the redemption and salvation of the world are events and revelations ineradicably united with the Nonviolent Jesus who taught and lived unto death and resurrection a Way of Nonviolent Love of friends and enemies! This is the Holy Week and Jesus of history, of the Gospel and of faith and therefore must be the Holy Week and Jesus of Liturgy and the pulpit. If this is not the Holy Week and Jesus proclaimed in Liturgy and from the pulpit during Holy Week — as well as during all other weeks until time is no more — then an abuse or misuse, culpable or non-culpable, of Liturgy and of pulpit is taking place.

221853,"Its absurd to think the FBI just found out about CIA Director Petraeus affair with Paula Broadwell, his biographer. The timing is too convenient.

The FBI knew about the affair some time ago and, under strict orders, kept their mouths shut until just after Election Day. If they hadnt, the scandal would have blown up during Obamas campaign run.

During the period the FBI knew about Petraeus affair, they also knew he was completely vulnerable to blackmail. In FBI and CIA circles, to have done nothing about it is considered treasonous. Putting a gag on these FBI people had to been done by the White House.

The latest word is that Petraeus will not testify before Congress about what really happened in Benghazi. He may be called on the carpet at a future time, which could mean never.

His absence will help conceal details of the Chris Stevens murder and the build-up of US-sponsored terrorists in the Benghazi sector of Libya.

In fact, Petraeus initial statements to Congress, behind closed doors on September 14, led legislators to believe that absurd film trailer was the cause of the uprising at the house where Stevens was attacked and killed. Was the Generals ridiculous declaration made under orders from the White House, who had the blackmail goods on him?

Then, finally, on October 26th, Petraeus, perhaps fed up at how he was being used by the White House to provide cover for the president, stated: No one at any level in the CIA told anybody not to help those in need [in Bengazi]. Claims to the contrary are simply inaccurate.

In this whole scenario, we would be looking at a potential case of double blackmail. First by the White House, who knew of the affair sometime ago, and second, by whoever might have wrung CIA and military secrets out of Petraeus because they knew about his affair with Broadwell.

What does that make Paula Broadwell. In intelligence parlance, she would be a classic honey trap.

By circumstance, by accident, or on purpose?

She has a long military background. A graduate of West Point, she directed counter-terrorism studies at Tufts University. She worked with the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force. She is no innocent.

She very well knew that, during the time of their extended affair, Petraeus was vulnerable to any number of blackmail vectors. This did not make her waver.

She knew this wasnt just some fling with a lieutenant colonel or even a run-of-the-mill general. Petraeus was head of all forces in the Afghanistan war. Then he was CIA director.

There are a lot of ways to write a biography that dont involve sleeping with the subject and opening him up to blackmail at a very high level.

People from both sides of the aisle in Washington are expressing deep sorrow that an American hero had to resign. What nonsense. Theyre building cover for Petraeus. Theyre intentionally avoiding the question of what compromises he may have agreed to during his peak military service and intelligence directorship.

In Afghanistan, Petraeus was Obamas choice to replace Stanley McChrystal, the general who blew his career during a Rolling Stone interview in which his men took pot shots at the president.

It is quite fair to ask whether Petraeus served as Obamas man in Afghanistan under the unspoken but implied threat that, if there were any kerfuffles, any deviations, any criticisms of the White House Afghan policy, Petraeus affair would become public knowledge.

It’s that time again. Flu season. And with it, a constant barrage of reminders to get your annual flu shot. Interestingly enough, what you’re being told about the influenza vaccine’s effectiveness and the reality are two very different stories. In January 2015, U.S. government officials admitted that, in most years, flu shots are — at best — 50 to 60 percent effective at preventing lab confirmed type A or B influenza requiring medical care.1

At the end of that same year, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analysis2 of flu vaccine effectiveness revealed that, between 2005 and 2015, the influenza vaccine was actually less than 50 percent effective more than half of the time. I wonder if the reality might be even worse than that.

Research from 2011 shows just how easy it is to inflate efficacy rates simply by using different end points.3 At that time, they found that by using serologic measures, i.e., the increase in influenza antibodies identified in the blood, results in an overestimation of vaccine efficacy.

During the 2015/2016 flu season, FluMist, the live virus nasal spray that typically has been recommended for children in recent years, had a failure rate of 97 percent.4 Its failure was so epic, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended FluMist be taken off the list of recommended flu vaccines for the 2016 to 2017 season, a recommendation CDC officials ended up heeding. There are many other examples of the influenza vaccine not protecting people as promised. So, what might we expect from the vaccine this year?

2017 Flu Vaccine Lineup

Flu vaccines are by their nature a tricky business because influenza viruses are constantly evolving and public health officials have to guess at least six months before the flu season starts which type A and B influenza virus strains will be predominantly in circulation so drug companies can manufacture the vaccines. When the strains chosen do not match the strains actually causing most of the disease in any given flu season, the vaccine’s failure rate significantly increases.

Even when there’s a good match, the flu vaccine’s effectiveness is estimated to be between 40 and 60 percent,5 meaning that, at best, public health officials believe you have a 60 percent lower chance of not getting sick with influenza if you get a flu shot. But it could be as low as 40 percent. Put another way, it is still a coin toss no matter which way you look at it. Natureu2019s Way Sambu... Buy New $$16.27 (as of 06:05 EST - Details)

Before reviewing influenza vaccines, It is important to remember that the majority of respiratory influenza-like illness that people experience during any given flu season is NOT type A or B influenza.6 When you get a sore throat, runny nose, headache, fatigue, low-grade fever, body aches and cough, most of the time it is another type of viral or bacterial respiratory infection unrelated to influenza viruses.7 There are several different types of influenza vaccines. This year, the available vaccine lineup includes:8,9

•Trivalent flu vaccines, which target two influenza A strains and one influenza B strain:

◦A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus

◦A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus

◦B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus

•Quadrivalent flu vaccines, which contain the same three strains as the trivalent, plus a second influenza B strain: B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus. Two different types of quadrivalent vaccines are licensed:

◦An inactivated version (Afluria quadrivalent)

◦A recombinant version (Flublok quadrivalent)

There are also a range of delivery methods and formulations:

A high-dose version for seniors over the age of 65, containing four times the amount of antigen as the regular dose of the standard vaccine

An adjuvanted vaccine (Fluad) for seniors over 65, first available during the 2016 to 2017 season. It contains an adjuvant called MF59, described as an oil-in-water emulsion of squalene oil, added to hyper-stimulate a strong inflammatory response to try to strengthen artificial vaccine acquired immunity

An intradermal flu vaccine for adults between 18 and 64

An egg-free recombinant version approved for people over the age of 4 with an egg allergy

A jet injector (needle-free) vaccine approved for adults between 18 and 64

Since it was licensed in 2003, a live attenuated flu vaccine in the form of a nasal spray has been available but, for the second year in a row, the CDC is recommending the nasal spray version not be used by anyone because of its history of ineffectiveness.

New for the 2017 to 2018 season is a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Flucelvax) for individuals over 4 years old that uses dog kidney cells (MDCK) for production.10 Traditionally, candidate vaccine strain influenza viruses, i.e., the viruses selected for inclusion in the vaccine, have been produced using fertilized chicken eggs.

The cell-based influenza vaccine viruses are grown in cultured animal cells instead of chicken eggs.11 Another relatively new technology uses insect cells to produce a recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine, Flublok, for individuals over 18 years old.12,13

Shoulder Damage Following Flu Vaccination

In October 2015, journalist Marlene Cimons wrote about her experience following a routine pneumonia vaccination.14 While she said the injection itself hurt more than most other vaccinations, that was nothing compared to the pain she developed in the days and months following. “Initially, I dismissed it as typical post-shot soreness,” she writes. “But it didn’t go away.” Months later, her left shoulder was still in pain. Her orthopedist diagnosed her with subacromial bursitis — chronic inflammation and fluid buildup in the bursa sac.

“I’m convinced this occurred because the nurse injected the vaccine too high on my arm. I had no symptoms before the shot, and pain has persisted since. The needle probably entered the top third of the deltoid muscle — which forms the rounded contours of the shoulder — and probably went into the bursa or the rotator cuff, instead of lower down, into the middle part of the muscle, missing the bursa and rotator cuff entirely,” Cimons writes. Dr. Mercola Liposomal ... Buy New $$39.97 (as of 07:30 EST - Details)

In a recent Facebook post, ABC Action News journalist Ashley Glass also complained of shoulder pain, saying she could “barely move my arm now,” following her flu shot.15 As it turns out, shoulder damage following vaccination16 is a known side effect of improper injection.

In a 2011 report, “Adverse Effects of Vaccines: Evidence and Causality,”17 the Institute of Medicine acknowledged that shoulder injuries are one of the possible adverse effects of vaccine injections, stating it found “convincing evidence of a causal relationship between injection of vaccine … and deltoid bursitis, or frozen shoulder, characterized by shoulder pain and loss of motion.”

Injection Site Injuries Becoming More Common

According to Dr. G. Russell Huffman, associate professor of orthopedic surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (cited by Cimons), shoulder injury related to vaccine administration, also known as SIRVA, includes chronic pain, limited range of motion, nerve damage, frozen shoulder and rotator cuff tears, and are typically the result of the injection being administered too high on the arm.

Rather than being injected into the muscle, the vaccine is injected into the bursa or joint space and, since vaccines are designed to provoke an immune response, the immune system ends up attacking the bursa sac, leading to the effects just mentioned.

Part of the problem appears to be related to more people receiving their vaccinations outside of a clinical setting, such as in pharmacies and grocery stores. Many will simply pull down the top of their shirt, exposing only the upper part of their deltoid, thereby increasing their risk of getting the injection in the wrong area.

Whatever the cause, reports of SIRVA have definitely increased in recent years,18 as has SIRVA cases settled in the federal vaccine injury court. Between 2011 and 2015, 112 patients were compensated for SIRVA and over 50 percent of those cases were brought in 2015.19,20 In 2016, 202 SIRVA cases were awarded damages by the national Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) created by Congress under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986.21

In July 2015, the Department of Health and Human Services proposed adding SIRVA to the NVICP Vaccine Injury Table (VIT), noting that, “The scientific evidence convincingly supports a causal relationship between an injection-related event and deltoid bursitis.” By adding it to the table, SIRVA cases brought before the government’s vaccine court will be easier and faster, allowing injured patients to receive compensation quicker.

SIRVA, as well as Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), were two vaccine reactions officially added to the VIT earlier this year, and applies to petitions for compensation filed under NVICP on or after March 21, 2017.22,23 One of the first case studies24 to recognize SIRVA was published in 2006. Clusters of GBS cases were noted among U.S. military personnel receiving the H1N1 influenza vaccine as early as 1976.25

It took a decade to get SIRVA added to the NVICP’s injury table. If it takes that long for the government to acknowledge that vaccine injection site injuries are real, imagine what it takes to prove other vaccine injuries.

For GBS, it took more than four decades. Is it any wonder then that many very serious vaccine-related neurological problems still have not made it onto that list — and some have even been taken OFF the list by government officials reluctant to award compensation — considering the far-ranging ramifications it might have for the childhood vaccination program? 26

The More Flu Vaccines You Get, the More Likely You’ll Get Sick

It seems no matter how poor influenza vaccine effectiveness is, the national call for everyone to get a flu shot every single year remains. But is getting an annual flu shot really “the best way” to protect yourself against influenza? Research frequently suggests otherwise. A recent article in Science Magazine27 delves into some of the finer points about individuality and how people’s immune responses vary depending on a number of different factors, including the age at which you’re exposed to the flu for the very first time.

That exposure will actually influence how your immune system responds for the rest of your life. Knowing this, what kind of effects might one expect when the first exposure to influenza viruses are vaccine viruses? It’s a gamble that no one has the answer to as of yet. Other studies have shown that:

Study Suggests Flu Vaccination During Pregnancy Can Cause Miscarriage

In 2009, reports of miscarriage following administration of the pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) swine flu vaccine started emerging.44 Dozens of women claimed they lost their babies hours or days after getting the pH1N1 vaccine, which had not been tested on pregnant women (if it was, the evidence was never published). Not surprisingly, these instances were passed off by health officials as coincidental. After all, miscarriages do happen, and for any number of different reasons.

Alas, scientific findings published September 25, 2017, in the medical journal Vaccine45,46,47 suggest this spike in miscarriage reports may not have been a fluke after all. Researchers found that women who had received a pH1N1-containing flu shot two years in a row were, in fact, more likely to suffer miscarriage within the following 28 days. While most of the miscarriages occurred during the first trimester, several also took place in the second trimester.

The median fetal term at the time of miscarriage was seven weeks. In all, 485 pregnant women aged 18 to 44 who had a miscarriage during the flu seasons of 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 were compared to 485 pregnant women who carried their babies to term. Of the 485 women who miscarried, 17 had been vaccinated twice in a row — once in the 28 days prior to vaccination and once in the previous year. For comparison, of the 485 women who had normal pregnancies, only four had been vaccinated two years in a row.

While study authors stated that direct causation could not be established, they called for more research to assess the link. Commenting on the study, which was funded by the CDC, Amanda Cohn, CDC adviser for vaccines stated:

“I think it’s really important for women to understand that this is a possible link, and it is a possible link that needs to be studied and needs to be looked at over more [flu] seasons. We need to understand if it’s the flu vaccine, or is this a group of women [who received flu vaccines] who were also more likely to have miscarriages.”

At present, the CDC is not making any changes to its recommendation for pregnant women, which states they can and should get a flu shot at any point during their pregnancy, no matter which trimester they’re in.48 This is irresponsible public health policy at its worst, placing the health of women and their unborn children in danger so corporations can profit.

Remember, the former head of the CDC, Julie Gerberding, left the CDC in 2009 to later become president of Merck Vaccines, a position she held until December 2014, when she became Merck’s executive vice president of strategic communications, global public policy and population health.49 She’s a poster child for the revolving door between government and industry, and a clear example of how that door is working against protecting the public health and safety.

Fraudulent Advertising Is the Norm for Flu Vaccines

Now we find out that the 2016 to 2017 influenza vaccine, which public health officials acknowledged was very well-matched to circulating viral strains and was hailed in February 2017 as “one of the most effective in years,”50 actually turned out to be another rather useless dud.

According to the CDC, 100 percent of circulating H1N1, 95 percent of the H3N2, 90.6 percent of the Victoria B lineage viruses and 100 percent of the Yamagata B lineage viruses were similar to the vaccine virus components for the 2016 to 2017 season.51

In other words, the match-up between the vaccine strains and the circulating strains causing type A or B influenza illness was about as good as you could ever hope for and, based on interim estimates in February, the CDC reported vaccinated individuals were 59 percent less likely to get sick than unvaccinated individuals.52

Dr. Joseph Bresee, CDC’s influenza division’s associate director of global health affairs, told NBC News this was “good news and underscores the importance and the benefit of both annual and ongoing vaccination efforts this season.”53 Fast-forward four months, and the good news turned into a report of last year’s seasonal flu shot being yet another dismal failure.

It turns out the 2016 to 2017 influenza vaccine had “no clear effect” in those between the ages of 18 and 49. Ditto for the elderly. In fact, influenza-related hospitalizations among seniors were the highest they’ve been since the 2014 to 2015 season, which was rated as “severe.”

Among young children, the effectiveness was about 60 percent.54 In older children and adults between the ages of 50 and 64, the overall effectiveness topped out at about 42 percent, in terms of preventing illness severe enough to send you to the hospital or doctor’s office.

As reported by U.S. News & World Report,55 “In four of the last seven flu seasons, influenza vaccine was essentially ineffective in seniors, past studies suggest. The worst performances tend to be in H3N2-dominant seasons.”

Last year, H3N2 type A influenza, which is associated with more severe illness and increased mortality among seniors and very young children, was the most prevalent influenza strain circulating in the U.S.56 So far, CDC influenza surveillance data indicates that H3N2 is the most prevalent strain circulating in the U.S. this year, as well.57

You can find a listing of adjusted vaccine effectiveness estimates for each influenza season going back to 2005 until 2016 on the CDC’s Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness, 2005 to 2017 webpage.58 told U.S. News & World Report, “While it is clear we need better flu vaccines, it’s important that we not lose sight of the important benefits of vaccination with currently available vaccines.”

What exactly those “important benefits” are was left unsaid. Personally, I cannot think of a single one. I can, however, point to a number of well-documented risks of harm and failure associated with influenza vaccine, which people take year after year, while apparently getting virtually no benefit at all.

Consider, for example, the mission statement of the Heritage Foundation, arguably the premier conservative think tank in America:

To formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense.

These words, or some variation of them, are embraced not only by the Heritage Foundation but also by every other conservative think tank and conservative educational foundation. Indeed, principles such as individual freedom, responsibility, free markets, and limited government have long been the mantra of American conservatives.

Yet a close examination of what conservatives believe should be the role of government in American life, reveals that the governmental policies they favor are inconsistent with — indeed, contradictory to — the principles of freedom, free enterprise, and limited government they expound.

Consider, for example, laws that criminalize the possession, use, and distribution of certain drugs. Conservatives have long endorsed such laws, enthusiastically. Just do a search of Heritage’s website — or that of any other conservative organization — and you will easily find any number of articles supporting the decades-long war on drugs. In fact, one of the nation’s most famous conservatives, William Bennett, even served as the federal government’s drug czar, proudly enforcing drug prohibition.

Yet how can drug laws be reconciled with free enterprise, limited government, and individual freedom, the principles that the Heritage Foundation and other conservative organizations expound?

Answer: They cannot be. Drug laws constitute a perfect violation of the principles of freedom and free markets.

Freedom entails the right of people to do whatever they want with their lives, so long as they don’t inflict violence on other people. Or as conservatives often say, freedom entails the right to live your life any way you want so long as you don’t infringe on the right of others to do the same.

Therefore, a truly free person has the moral right to ingest any substance whatsoever, no matter how dangerous or harmful. It might not be the healthy thing to do. But freedom entails the right of each person to make that choice, healthy or not healthy.

Most people would argue that smoking cigarettes is not a healthy thing to do. Yet very few people, including conservatives, advocate criminalizing the possession, use, or distribution of tobacco. Paraphrasing Voltaire, the freedom advocate would say, I don’t agree with your decision to smoke cigarettes but I will defend to the death your right to do so.

But when it comes to such illicit drugs as heroin, cocaine, and marijuana, conservatives knowingly abandon the principles of freedom that they expound. Their position is that the state should wield the necessary power to jail and fine any person who possesses, uses, or distributes such drugs, even if he is doing so in the privacy of his own home.

How can laws against drug distribution be reconciled with conservatives’ declared devotion to free enterprise? Answer: They can’t be. Free enterprise, as every conservative knows, requires that a private enterprise be free of government control or regulation. A system in which criminal laws punish the distribution of certain drugs is about as far from free enterprise as one can get. A truly free market in drugs is one in which the government not only doesn’t punish people for possessing, using, or distributing drugs, but actually protects their right to do so.

Public schooling

Consider another example of conservatives’ intentional violation of the principles they expound: public schooling. It would be difficult to find a better example of socialistic central planning — that is, anti-free-market activity — than public schooling. After all, when we use that term — public — we’re referring not to the general public but instead to the government. Public schooling is a government operation. Even worse, it’s a quasi-monopoly, a type of institution that economists have long recognized is anti-free enterprise.

Under public schooling, the government, either at the national, state, or local level, plans in a top-down, command-and-control manner, the educational decisions of multitudes of students. Attendance is mandatory, with criminal contempt charges hanging over the heads of recalcitrant parents. Students are taught government-approved doctrines by government-approved schoolteachers using government-approved textbooks following a government-approved curriculum.

I repeat: It would be difficult to find a better example of a violation of the freedom principles set forth in the mission statement of the Heritage Foundation and other conservative organizations: free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values.

Again, free enterprise means an enterprise free of government involvement. In education, it would mean removing government involvement entirely from education — separating school and state the way our ancestors separated church and state. A free enterprise in education would mean that consumers — families — would decide which educational tools to purchase for their children, and it would mean that entrepreneurs and businesses would supply consumer needs. That’s what free enterprise is all about, as conservatives well know.

With public schooling, not only is government actively involved in education, it’s actually running the show! But while conservatives sometimes recognize this — as well as the predictably disastrous results of this government operation — the best they can do is call for some variation of government control, such as school vouchers. And this despite the fact that vouchers themselves constitute a severe violation of the principles of free enterprise, individual freedom, and traditional American values.

After all, what are vouchers except another form of government welfare, something that conservatives claim to stand against? How many times have we heard conservatives rail against the food-stamp mother in the grocery-store line? Yet vouchers are no different. They are a form of government welfare provided to people to help them educate their children. Like all government welfare projects, they rely on the power of the state to forcibly take money from Peter, who may not even have children, to give the money to Paul, an action that conservatives rail against when it comes to food stamps.

How can the forcible taking of one person’s money in order to give it to another person be reconciled with moral values, which are another important tenet in the principles that conservatives expound? Answer: It can’t be. The immorality of an action (e.g., the forcible taking of one person’s money and giving it to another person) is not converted into a moral action simply because government officials, rather than private individuals, are engaged in it.

Moreover, under the First Amendment, the state is prohibited from forcibly indoctrinating people’s children with religious principles. Yet many people, including conservatives, consider religious principles to be an important part of a person’s education, not simply on Sunday but instead naturally interweaved with the subjects he is studying in school.

The ideal way to resolve this problem is simply to end government involvement in education, which would free families to determine the best education for their children. If a family wished their children to be inculcated with religious values as part of their everyday education, they could do so. Those who wished otherwise could choose a different type of education.

Unfortunately, however, conservatives cannot bring themselves to call for a separation of school and state. Resigning themselves to state control over education, they instead devote their efforts to coming up with schemes on how to teach religion in public schools, which is the title of an article by Krista Kafer, educational policy analyst at Heritage, or they spend their time promoting school-voucher plans, which are really nothing more than educational welfare schemes.

What conservatives all too often fail to recognize is that religious instruction in public (i.e., state) schools can in no way be called voluntary. Even attendance in public schools cannot be considered voluntary, given the state’s compulsory-attendance laws. Students are there because they have to be there. They’re there because of state compulsion. Equally important, their teachers are government employees.

How can forcing children to attend state institutions to learn religious principles from government personnel be reconciled with traditional American values, which the Heritage Foundation and other conservatives claim to support? Indeed, how can educational vouchers be reconciled with such values? Answer: They can’t be.

The welfare state

It’s not simply in the area of drug laws and education that conservatives support governmental regulation and welfare. Long ago conservatives threw their support behind virtually the entire gamut of social-welfare programs that came into existence after the Franklin Roosevelt socioeconomic revolution.

Consider Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, core elements of the welfare state. A genuine free market in retirement and health care would entail everyone’s keeping his own money and deciding for himself how to use it — saving, investing, spending, donating, et cetera.

Yet the best that conservative think tanks and foundations can do is advocate some type of reform plan, such as Social Security IRAs or Medical IRAs, which are sold to their supporters and the public as free-enterprise approaches to the health-care crisis.

In fact, one of the distinguishing characteristics of conservative organizations is their common use of the word reform. The Heritage Foundation and other conservative organizations are notorious for calling for reform of social-welfare programs rather than their elimination, which of course then provides the opportunity for more studies and analyses to be made of the reforms, which then inevitably produce calls for more reforms.

So the question arises: Why do conservative organizations maintain mission statements that are contradictory to the actual government policies they support? Wouldn’t it be more honest, for example, if the Heritage Foundation and other conservative think tanks and organizations changed their mission statements to something like the following: To conserve and reform the socialistic welfare state using the principles of efficient government regulation and welfare. Wouldn’t those words more accurately describe what Heritage and other conservative organizations actually stand for?

Foreign policy

Domestic policy is not the only troubling area for conservatives. Foreign policy provides an equally good example of where conservative policies don’t match the principles that conservatives expound.

Consider, for example, the phrase strong national defense used by many conservatives. What they mean by that is not a military sized to defend the United States from a foreign invasion, which today is virtually a nonexistent possibility. What they mean instead is the maintenance of a foreign overseas military empire, in which U.S. troops are stationed all over the world to maintain international order.

Moreover, as we have learned since 9/11, conservatives support the president’s wielding omnipotent power in foreign affairs — that is, power unconstrained by law — to do whatever he deems is necessary to win the war on the terrorism. Such power includes kidnapping, assassination, bombing, torture, rendition, spying on citizens, and not brooking federal-court interference with the treatment of prisoners, including American prisoners.

That’s limited government?

Consider the omnipotent power that the president now wields to send the entire nation into war against countries that have never attacked the United States, even if it entails killing tens of thousands of innocent people in the process. The president no longer feels any need to first secure a congressional declaration of war, as the Constitution requires. He now wields the omnipotent power to wage wars of aggression, wars that were punished as a war crime by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.

That’s national defense?

Wouldn’t it be more honest if conservative organizations changed their mission statements with respect to foreign policy to read something like this: To formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of empire and wars of aggression? After all, that’s effectively what the noted conservative Max Boot has now done. Unlike other conservatives, Boot no longer operates under the false pretense that America is a limited-government republic. He now openly (and truthfully) declares that America is an empire and that the world should simply get used to it.

Personal responsibility

Another problem with conservatives, however, is that they hardly ever accept individual responsibility for the consequences of the public policies they advocate, even though they often preach the importance of individual responsibility as part of the principles they expound. Like liberals, they wish to be judged by their good intentions, not by the actual results of their policies.

Have you ever heard conservatives declare, We are sorry for all the bad things we have wrought with our drug war, including gang wars, convenience-store murders, muggings, robberies, and governmental corruption? Have you ever heard them declare, We are sorry about all the young people whose minds have been damaged and whose lives have been distorted by our system of coerced state schooling? Have you ever heard conservatives declare, We are sorry for all the terrorism — and the assaults on civil liberties that such terrorism has produced — that has resulted from our pro-empire, pro-war foreign policy? Indeed, given the growing debacle in Iraq, conservatives are becoming increasingly reluctant to remind people of their ardent support of U.S. government actions to oust Saddam Hussein from power, including the sanctions on Iraq, which became a prime motivation for the World Trade Center attacks in 1993 and 2001, and President Bush’s invasion of Iraq in 2003.

Federal spending

Moreover, when one adds up all the costs of all the programs, both domestic and foreign, that conservatives support, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, subsidies, foreign aid, the drug war, the war on terrorism, and the war on Iraq, it’s not difficult to see why federal spending is now totally out of control, which every conservative knows in his heart constitutes a grave threat to the financial and monetary well-being of the American people. Nevertheless, while conservatives continue to rail against big government and big spending, they simply ignore that it is the sum total of the public policies they are supporting, both foreign and domestic, that is producing the big government and big spending that they’re railing against.

Is there a way out of the many crises that face our nation? Yes, but the way out lies not simply in preaching the principles of freedom but also in consistently applying them. It is only through a consistent application of moral principles in public policy that individual liberty, free markets, and a constitutional republic will be restored to our land, along with the peace, prosperity, and harmony that would come in their wake.

We are supposed to feel sorry for 59-year-old Robert Freniere, a retired Air Force colonel with three graduate degrees who once served as a special assistant to General Stanley McChrystal and has spent extensive time in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Now he lives in his van because he can’t even find work as a janitor. According to the original article about him, he “receives an annual pension from the military of more than $40,000.”

People would kill for his military pension. I could certainly double my writing output if I was paid even half that every year.

A reader (D.J.) informs me that according to DoD’s own website a colonel with 30 years of service who retired in 2010 is making $78,000+ a year.

51030,"Trucks, like high-performance sports cars – like minivans for that matter – are specialty vehicles. Which means they’re compromised vehicles.

Some things, they’re very good at – usually, much better at them than a jack-of-all-trades family car.

A high-performance sports car, for instance, can be driven faster around a race track (or your favorite winding country road) than a family car before it approaches the limits of its ability to hold the road.

But the flip slide of this extra capability here is less capability there.

To wit: High-performance sports cars are usually awful in the snow. And they are awful in the snow to a great extent precisely because of the design aspects and features that make them adroit high-speed handlers on dry pavement – such as sport-compound (and short sidewall) “summer” tires and being low to the ground (and so having a low center of gravity).

In this case, you can’t have your cake and eat it, too.

Same goes for trucks – and SUVs built on a truck-type layout.

In order to be extra-capable off-road, on-road handling and stability are usually at least somewhat compromised.

Trucks and truck-based SUVs usually have more ground clearance – they sit higher up off the pavement – which is exactly what you want if you’re heading out into heavy snow or thinking about attempting a trek up a rutted, rock-strewn dirt road. (The lack of clearance, by the way, is one of the chief reasons why low-slung sporty cars suck in the snow. They bottom out sooner – and ride up on top of the accumulating snow, which reduces the ability of the tires to bite through the snow to the pavement.)

On the other hand, riding higher off the ground also means a higher center of gravity – which is exactly what you don’t want if the object is high-speed handling stability, especially in the curves.

The higher ground clearance/higher center of gravity typical of truck/SUV design is one of the primary reasons why they’re inherently less stable – and more prone to rollover accidents – than are cars. The auto industry has worked hard to make trucks and SUVs handle more like cars, to accommodate the conflicting demands and expectations of consumers, but they’re still compromised – and will probably always be compromised . . . so long as consumers expect vehicles to be rugged off-road as well as civilized on-road.

One method by which the car companies have attempted to crutch this Catch-22 is by fitting trucks and SUVs with car-type wheel and tire packages. Specifically, tall (and wide) wheels with short (and stiff) sidewall “sport” tires – as opposed to the Mud & Snow (M&S) rated tires – and not as tall, nor as wide – wheels you’d want if you don’t want to get stuck in the snow and mud. The end result is an automotive oddity. A truck/SUV that might actually be worse in the snow than a standard passenger car.

Again, you can’t have it both ways.

Same goes for the pros – and cons – of the truck’s (and truck-based SUV’s) four-wheel-drive system.

Most trucks and truck-based SUVs are rear-wheel-drive – with a part-time four-wheel-drive system optionally available. It is very, very important to comprehend the functional differences – and relative strengths and weaknesses – of truck-type four-wheel-drive vs. the increasingly ubiquitous all-wheel-drive, which (very confusingly) is often marketed as “four wheel drive” (see, for an example, the 2014 Jeep Cherokee; reviewed here).

Both systems do – technically – send power to (i.e., drive) all four wheels. But truck-type 4WD only sends power to the rear wheels when it’s not engaged, whereas AWD normally sends most of the engine’s power (90 percent being typical) to the front wheels – with (second Big Difference) power being automatically routed to the back wheels in the event the front wheels being to slip. With a part-time, truck-type 4WD system, the driver must engage the 4WD for any power to be routed to the front wheels. Otherwise, all the engine’s power is going to the rear-wheel-drive – and when in RWD, trucks and SUVs (which are light in the tail) are more prone to slipping and sliding than a FWD car!

“In our dreams, we have limitless resources, and the people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hand.” ~ Frederick Gates, chairman of the Rockefeller-created General Education Board, 1902.

For those of us who love and understand individual freedom, it sometimes seems as if the Atlantic just isn’t wide enough to impede the collaboration of Anglo-American elites seeking to re-mold the world closer to their hearts’ desire.

That last phrase, incidentally, assumes that those elites, who look at us with u201Cbright, dead alien eyes,u201D could be said to have human hearts.

The government of departing British Prime Minister Tony Blair has announced a new initiative entitled the u201CNurse Family Partnershipu201D that would (in the words of the Guardian of London) u201Cintervene as early as possible in troubled families, first-time mothers identified just 16 weeks after conception [who] will be given intensive weekly support from midwives and health visitors until the unborn child reaches two years old.u201D

This program could be considered a form of pre-emptive parens patriae; that phrase refers to the fatherhood of the State. The Guardian captured the essence of the British early-intervention initiative in its headline: u201CUnborn babies targeted in crackdown on criminality.u201D

The Blair government, summarized that left-leaning periodical, u201Cis prepared to single out babies still in the womb to break cycles of deprivation and behaviour…. Under the programme, which has been copied from the United States, young, first-time mothers will be assigned a personal health visitor at between 16 and 20 weeks into their pregnancy. They will continue to have weekly or fortnightly visits until the child is two….u201D (Emphasis added.)

u201CChildren belong to the general family, to the state, before belonging to private families.” ~ French Revolutionary leader Bertrand Barere, whose memory was later invoked by French parents to scare disobedient children (I’m serious)

The objective is for these intruders, who are clothed in the supposed authority of the State (the u201Ccoldest of all cold monstersu201D), to instruct mothers how to care for their own flesh and blood. The program is u201Cvoluntary,u201D for now. It will not remain so.

As noted above, the Nurse Family Partnership (NFP) was devised in the United States by Dr. David Olds of the University of Colorado. It has been implemented in 22 states, and legislation proposed by Senators Ken Salazar (D-Colorado) and Arlen Specter (R-Pennsylvania) would u201Cexpand accessu201D to the program to all 50 states and the District of Columbia u201Cthrough the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) … providing at-home nurse visits for up to 570,000 first-time mothers each year.u201D

For more than a century, collectivist social engineers have extolled the merits of home visitations by State-assigned social workers as a way of circumventing parental authority and establishing a proprietary claim on children. The most notorious recent examples — on this side of the Atlantic, in any case — are Hillary Clinton and Janet Reno, the latter demonstrating her solicitude for children by immolating more than a dozen of them at Mt. Carmel and sending stormtroopers to seize another from his Miami relatives at gunpoint.

In her ghost-written opus It Takes a Village, Madame Hillary rhapsodized that she u201Ccan’t say enoughu201D about the merits of home visitation programs. The Nation’s Alexander Cockburn, whose household acquaintances in England included members of the Fabian Socialist movement, has pointed out that Hillary’s blueprint for social engineering bears a familial resemblance to Fabianism.

“Time and again, reading … It Takes a Village, I was reminded of [Fabian founder] Beatrice Webb,” Cockburn has observed. “There’s the same imperious gleam, the same lust to improve the human condition until it conforms to the wretchedly constricted vision of freedom that gave us social-worker liberalism, otherwise known as therapeutic policing.”

“Home visitation” la Janet Reno in Miami…. … and in Waco.

In his 1919 book New Worlds for Old, Fabian activist H.G. Wells (better known for his science fiction offerings), laid out the basic premise of u201Ctherapeutic policingu201D: u201CSocialism regards parentage under proper safeguards as ‘not only a duty but a service’ to the state; that is to say, it proposes to pay for good parentage — in other words, to endow the home.u201D

By making the mother dependent on subsidies, the State became the surrogate father. And, as Wells pointed out, the State claims the right to raise u201Citsu201D children, should the natural parents be found unsuitable. This is the tacit but unmistakable threat that accompanies every State official who is permitted to violate the sanctity of the home.

The Blair regime’s NFP Action Plan makes this quite plain, at least to people alert to the nuances of State-speak:

Section 1.2 of the Action Plan claims a mandate for the government to assure that nobody is permitted to u201Cwasteu201D his u201Chuman potential,u201D since this is u201Cbad for the whole country.u201D

Section 1.6 asserts the State’s right and capacity to take u201Cpreventative actionu201D within the home in order to u201Ctackle problems before they become fully entrenched and blight the lives of both individuals and wider society.u201D

Section 1.9 attempts to cast u201Cwider societyu201D as a victim of unregulated families, since u201Cthe behaviour of some people — particularly some of the most challenging families — causes real disruption and distress in the community around them.u201D ZZ Top they ain’t, but they are one of history’s most notable power trios, “The Therapeutic Police”: Fabian founders Beatrice and Sydney Webb (from the left, appropriately), and Fabian popularizer George Bernard Shaw.

Thus the need, as the Blair regime and its American consultant describe it, to u201Cdevelop and promote better prediction tools for use by front-line practitionersu201D and take measures u201Cto ensure that those identified as at risk are followed up.u201D

Some sense of the purpose of u201Cfollowing upu201D on u201Cat risku201D families can be found in the British Government’s Policy Review paper, u201CThe Role of the Stateu201D:

u201CThe state … has the legitimate monopoly of force in a given territory,u201D that paper begins, immediately laying a totalitarian foundation (from Lenin — the State exercises u201Cpower without limit, resting directly on forceu201D; from Mussolini — u201CEverything within the State, nothing outside the State, nothing against the Stateu201D).

The Fabian Socialist crest depicts a wolf in sheep’s clothing — a suitable symbol for that subversive movement, and an apt metaphor for government “home visitation” programs.

The NFP initiative, the paper continues, is inspired by the vision of a u201Cstrategic and enabling stateu201D which would be u201Cless about command and control and more about collaboration and partnership.u201D The state will u201Cfocus on ends, not the means by which [its] goals are delivered,u201D working through u201Ca new partnership between the State and the citizen.u201D

Ah, but remember that the u201Ccollaboratoru201D and u201Cpartneru201D offering its assistance to the citizen claims u201Cthe legitimate monopoly of force,u201D which means that in the event of a dispute, it is the citizen, not the State, that will be compelled to yield.

To anyone even slightly familiar with the tenets of the Clinton-era u201CThird Way,u201D or the nostrums of the attenuated variety of Marxism called u201CCommunitarianism,u201D none of this will be new. It may strike some as remarkable that the American version of the NFP program has become so deeply entrenched during the reign of George W. Bush, but this wouldn’t be considered odd by those who understand u201Ccompassionate conservatismu201D to be politically enharmonic with Clinton’s u201CI Feel Your Painu201D-style corporatism.

Furthermore, as much as it pains me to admit it, the British Fabian Socialists have nothing on their American counterparts regarding the long, patient campaign to subvert the family.

u201CSince the 1840s … American social history could be written as the deliberate dismantling of the home-centered economy, and the consequent decay of the foundations of our liberty,u201D observers Dr. Alan Carlson. u201C[T]his turn against the home was not a natural consequence of industrialization or the emergence of a modern economy. Rather, the change derived from the application of statist ideology and consciously-made political and legal choices.u201D

“The first direct assault on family autonomy grew out of the reform school movement during the 1830s,” whose influence was particularly strong in New York and Pennsylvania, continues Dr. Carlson. In 1839, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, acting on assumptions inspired by the reform school movement, invoked the concept of parens patriae to justify the state’s actions in supplanting parents it found “unequal to” or “unworthy of the task” of educating children.

In 1882, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled: “It is the unquestioned right and imperative duty of every enlightened government, in its character of parens patriae to protect and provide for the comfort and well-being of its citizens…. The performance of this duty is justly regarded as one of the most important governmental functions, and all constitutional limitations must be so understood and construed so as not to interfere with its proper and legitimate exercise.” (Emphasis added.) The principle of parens patriae, properly understood, requires the demolition of all constitutional limitations, rather than their u201Credefinition.u201D

In 1913, Dr. Arthur W. Calhoun published A Social History of The American Family: From Colonial Times to the Present, which would become an authoritative text for American social-service and welfare workers. Calhoun was remarkably unabashed in promoting a perspective on State supremacy that could have been offered by Marx and Engels (who brazenly called for u201Cabolition of the family!u201D in the Communist Manifesto):

“American history consummates the disappearance of the wider [or extended] familism and the substitution of the parentalism of society…. The new view is that the higher and more obligatory relation is to society rather than to the family; the family goes back to the age of savagery while the state belongs to the age of civilization. The modern individual is a world citizen, served by the world, and home interests can no longer be supreme.”

By 1930, the year that President Herbert Hoover convened the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection, it was possible for an American president to describe, in public, the individual child as someone “who belongs to the community almost as much as to the family,” and a citizen of “a world predestinedly [sic] moving toward unity.u201D The latter phrase seems to foretell, by roughly six decades, the claim contained in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child that government is the primary custodian of all children, with the UN itself at the head of a global system of parens patriae.

For more than a century and a half, collectivist cliques on both sides of the Atlantic have been engaged in a kind of dialectical pas de deux where State control over the family is concerned, each side propelling the other to ever-greater heights of presumption. As I said, sometimes it seems a pity that England is just one ocean away.

The 1% the zombies and the rest of us

How about that Dow? Up 286 points yesterday. And gold up $$17. Markets are counting on their hero, Mr. Benjamin S. Bernanke, to come to the rescue. They can practically hear the printing presses warming up and smell the fresh $$100 bills rolling off.

And where does all the money go? Long time passing

Where does all the money go? Long time ago

Where does all the money go? Gone to rich people every one

When will they ever learn? Oh when will they ever learn?

But nobody seems to make the connection. Only here at The Daily Reckoning will we give it to you straight:

The working classes made substantial gains until the 1970s. Then, wages went flat for the next 40 years.

Wealth was shared out fairly evenly too until the 1970s. From Wikipedia:

data from a number of sources indicate that income inequality over all has grown significantly since the late 1970s, after several decades of stability.

A 2011 study by the CBO found that the top earning 1 percent of households gained about 275% after federal taxes and income transfers over a period between 1979 and 2007.

What happened in the 70s that changed things? Take a guess. The feds changed the money. From a money that was limited  because it was connected to gold  to new money that would stretch as far as the feds wanted to pull it. In the event, they used it to increase US credit outstanding 50 times since the 60s. Total US credit didnt exceed $$1 trillion until 1964. Over the next 43 years it rose to over $$50 trillion.

Where did this new money go? Well, to lots of people all over the world

But more of it went to rich people than to anyone else.

And now everybodys gunning for the rich for the 1%. And what was their crime? Didnt they just get lucky?

But the complainers act as though they did something wrong. As if making money was wrong

And even if that were true, it doesnt address the real issue: how come the 1% got to make so much money?

Even very rich people themselves dont know. And very smart people, such as Nobel Prize-winning economists seem to have no curiosity about it. They just think its time for the rich to give back:

The 1 Percents Problem By Joseph E. Stiglitz, Vanity Fair

Lets start by laying down the baseline premise: inequality in America has been widening for decades. Were all aware of the fact. Yes, there are some on the right who deny this reality, but serious analysts across the political spectrum take it for granted. I wont run through all the evidence here, except to say that the gap between the 1 percent and the 99 percent is vast when looked at in terms of annual income, and even vaster when looked at in terms of wealth  that is, in terms of accumulated capital and other assets. Consider the Walton family: the six heirs to the Walmart empire possess a combined wealth of some $$90 billion, which is equivalent to the wealth of the entire bottom 30 percent of US society. (Many at the bottom have zero or negative net worth, especially after the housing debacle.) Warren Buffett put the matter correctly when he said, Theres been class warfare going on for the last 20 years and my class has won.

Thats about as close as Mr. Stiglitz comes to analyzing the situation, as if it were the result of class warfare. He doesnt seem to realize that Buffett was joking. Or should have been.

Instead, he goes on to describe how wealth inequality is a problem: because people without money cant consume because it leads people to become zombies (rent seekers rather than producers) because it is unfair and because it creates mistrust in the society, leading to dysfunctional institutions.

Then, he offers a solution. He pitches it to the 1% in terms of self-interest:

When invited to consider proposals to reduce inequality  by raising taxes and investing in education, public works, health care, and science  put any latent notions of altruism aside and reduce the idea to one of unadulterated self-interest. Dont embrace it because it helps other people. Just do it for yourself.

He doesnt explain how getting 1% of the voters on your side would make much of a difference in a general election. Presumably, the electorate or its representatives must approve these proposals. Nor does he bother to tell us how spending more money, or investing as he puts, on more education, more boondoggles and more health care will cause wealth to move from the 1% to the 99%. After all, the feds have been lavishing money on those programs for the last 30 years  just as income equality increased!

Nowhere did they spend more money than in the Zombie City itself, Washington, DC. For every dollar Washington pays in taxes it gets back $$5 from taxpayers elsewhere. And nowhere is there greater income dis-equality than in Washington.

Well heres a little good news.

The zombies were dealt a setback this week. Wisconsins governor, Scott Walker, beat back the public employees unions in a recall election.

We dont usually touch politics here at The Daily Reckoning. We dont have a pair of rubber gloves thick enough. But when a politician balances a state budget without raising taxes it is noteworthy. It is even more noteworthy when he has cut back on zombie expenses and then is able to hold his own when the zombies counterattack!

It might even lead some observers to imagine that Mitt Romney might win the presidential election and that he might turn out to be a zombie-killer too. Others go so far as to think the tables have been turned against the zombies, generally.

Wed like to believe it. But history is a long, sad tale of strong leaders doing the wrong thing, not the right thing. If they did the right thing there wouldnt be so much history. No big wars no great revolutions no economic catastrophes.

If history can count on leaders to do the wrong thing so can we.

Mitt Romney is no threat to the zombies. In fact, hes already pledged to give them more fresh meat. Thats right, he says hell send more resources to the US military  the biggest zombie organization on the planet. Why does Mitt think the Pentagon is a little short? Because some of the most powerful lobbyists and biggest campaign donors say so! What more proof could you want?

As to the un-armed zombies, we havent seen Mitt declare himself one way or the other. He seems to have no fixed positions; hell go where the zombies push him. Just like Barack Obama.

But it probably doesnt make any difference. For every successful fight against the zombies, such as the one just won by Scott Walker, there are hundreds or thousands of skirmishes, ambushes, and pitched battles where, when the dust settles, zombies are the only ones still standing.

Yesterday, we sat in our local Ford dealers office while our truck got serviced. Keeping an eye on the TV screen in the waiting room, we noticed no fewer than three zombie ads within a 15-minute period. Two of them were for lawyers. One at 1-800-299-HURT offers to sue someone for you if you were in a traffic accident or a victim of medical malpractice. The other, at 1-800-THE-FIRM , said that if you were injured on the job or in a store, there was a good chance that the business was responsible.

The third advertisement appealed directly to the zombie instinct. It was for a company that calls itself Disability Associates, a group that makes a business out of getting people firmly into zombiedom, where they are fully supported by the rest of us.

Wouldnt you want to know and be able to make some changes so that you do not progress into the ""disease"" range?

Being able to look at your blood work in this manner could make big differences in your overall health in the long run. Standard blood work can give lots of information about nutritional intake, digestion, mineral balance, immune status, liver function and kidney function. In most cases, health problems do not begin overnight. Regular blood work as a preventive tool tells you what areas to target and if the things you are doing are actually working.

Abnormal blood chemistry usually indicates an underlying functional issue. For example, high triglyceride and cholesterol levels are typically used as markers for cardiovascular risk, but they also can indicate deficiencies of essential fatty acids, blood sugar issues, liver/gallbladder dysfunction, thyroid problems and poor digestive function.

Nothing is likely to get an argument started among sports fans faster than attempts to name the all-time greatest in any sport, or even the all-time greatest in a particular aspect of a sport. However, in baseball, we can at least narrow down the list of possibilities — considerably, in fact — when it comes to hitting.

Who was the all-time greatest hitter?

A lot depends on how much weight you give to batting average versus power hitting. But it would be hard to consider someone for the title of the all-time greatest hitter if someone else had both a higher lifetime batting average and a higher lifetime slugging average. That narrows down the list considerably.

The highest lifetime batting average was Ty Cobb’s .367. But Rogers Hornsby hit .358 and, being far more of a home-run hitter, Hornsby had a higher lifetime slugging average than Cobb. No one had both a higher lifetime batting average and a higher lifetime slugging average than Cobb or Hornsby. Both of them therefore belong on the short list of candidates.

Babe Ruth had by far the highest lifetime slugging average — .690. Batting averages count how many hits there are in how many official times at bat. Slugging averages count how many total bases there are from these hits — counting a single as one base and a home run as four, for example.

If you get two singles and a double every 10 times at bat, then your batting average is .300, and your four total bases mean that your slugging average is .400. If you get two singles and a home run, then your six bases give you a slugging average of .600.

Babe Ruth’s lifetime slugging average of .690 means that he averaged nearly 7 total bases every 10 times at bat. That would mean something like a single, a double and a home run every 10 times at bat — over a span of 22 years.

Some great sluggers, in their best seasons, have had slugging averages of .700 or more, usually once or twice in a lifetime. Only two players — Babe Ruth and Barry Bonds — ever had a slugging average over .800 in a season. That’s equivalent to two singles, a double and a home run every 10 times at bat, all season long.

But if we are talking about the all-time greatest hitters, we usually mean over the course of a career, not just in a particular season when a batter was hot.

To put the Babe’s .690 lifetime slugging average in perspective, even such great sluggers as Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio and Hank Greenberg, in their greatest seasons, never had a slugging average as high as the .690 that Babe Ruth had for his whole career. So the Babe makes the short list.

Ted Williams is best known for batting .406. What is not nearly as well known is that he had a lifetime slugging average exceeded only by Babe Ruth’s — and Williams’ lifetime batting average of .344 was two points higher than the Babe’s. So no one had both a higher lifetime batting average and a higher lifetime slugging average than Ted Williams. He too makes the short list.

There is another important dimension to batting, the ability to come through in the clutch. This is not so easily quantifiable. However, there is one batter who stands out above all others when it comes to runs batted in — Lou Gehrig.

Despite a career shortened by the disease that bears his name, Lou Gehrig still holds the record for the most seasons with more than 150 runs batted in — seven seasons, one out of every two full seasons in his career. Babe Ruth is second with three seasons of 150 or more runs batted in. Gehrig had 184 RBIs in 1931.

Lou Gehrig also set the lifetime record for the most home runs with the bases loaded, a record recently tied by Alex Rodriguez. Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron and Barry Bonds, in their longer careers, hit over 200 more home runs than Gehrig, but none of the three hit as many homers with the bases loaded.

Lou Gehrig’s lifetime slugging average is third on the all-time list, just one point behind Ted Williams’. Gehrig’s lifetime batting average of .340 is 2 points lower than Babe Ruth’s and 4 points lower than Ted Williams’. But, if clutch hitting counts, Gehrig also belongs on the short list of all-time great batters.

We can argue about how to weigh various aspects of hitting, in order to pick the one all-time greatest batter, but at least we can narrow down the list of possibilities to five.

Trying to choose the greatest pitcher of all time is at least as difficult as trying to choose the greatest hitter of all time. In both cases, the best we can do is narrow down the list.

Outside a charmed circle of five batters, no one had both a higher lifetime batting average and a higher lifetime slugging average than any of those five. In alphabetical order, they are Ty Cobb, Lou Gehrig, Rogers Hornsby, Babe Ruth and Ted Williams. There are other batters whose lifetime records came close, including Barry Bonds, Jimmie Foxx and Hank Greenberg. But close cannot define the greatest.

When it comes to choosing the all-time greatest pitcher, there are even more complications than there are in choosing the candidates for the all-time greatest batter. Batting is much more of an individual achievement, while a pitcher’s record depends on what his team does, both at bat and in the field.

A great pitcher who is pitching for a team that scores very few runs may have a tougher time winning games than a pitcher who gives up an average of 3 runs a game, but who is pitching for a team that scores an average of 5 runs a game for him.

When a pitcher has a great double-play combination behind him at shortstop and second base, or a Willie Mays or Joe DiMaggio in center field, that can also keep his earned run average down.

With pitchers, as with batters, a spectacular season should not carry as much weight as a whole career of great achievements. Back in the early 20th century, there were a couple of 40-game winners, and 37-game winner Iron Man McGinnity on several occasions pitched both games in a double-header. But pitching a lot of games in a season was not a formula for longevity.

On the other hand, total wins in a lifetime cannot be the sole criterion, since that obviously depends on longevity as much as on pitching effectiveness. Weighing strikeouts against earned run averages can also vary from one observer to the next.

Since the ultimate purpose of pitching is not simply to strike out batters but to keep the other team from scoring, I would give a lot of weight to shutouts. Here one man stands head and shoulders above the rest.

Walter Johnson is the only pitcher to pitch more than a hundred shutouts in his career — 110, in fact. Playing for a team that was not always among the best, more than one-fourth of his 416 career victories were shutouts.

With even the greatest pitchers of our era seldom going the full nine innings, Walter Johnson’s 110 shutouts seems to be the baseball record least likely to be broken. In order to compare the pitchers of our time with those of the past, earned run averages may have to be used.

Walter Johnson’s lifetime earned run average was 2.17. Christy Mathewson had a lifetime ERA of 2.13, but Mathewson played for better teams. It is hard to think of any other pitcher whose lifetime records top theirs, except for records based on sheer longevity, like Cy Young’s 511 victories. Cy Young had a lifetime ERA of 2.63 — obviously great, but not the greatest.

Hard as it is to narrow down the candidates for the title of greatest batter of all time, or the greatest pitcher of all time, selecting who should be nominated as having the greatest versatility seems a lot easier.

There is only one baseball player who, at various times, led the league in both batting and pitching categories. That one man was Babe Ruth.

The Bambino had a league-leading batting average of .378 in 1924 and hit .393 the previous year, when Harry Heilmann hit .403. When it came to home runs, Ruth was the only man to lead the league in that category in 12 different seasons.

Babe Ruth’s records as a pitcher are not nearly as well known. But he led the league in ERA with 1.75 in 1916. His lifetime ERA was 2.28, putting him in the company of the greatest pitchers of all time. The Babe still holds the American League record for the most shutouts in a season by a left-handed pitcher, and holds the record for the longest shutout ever pitched in the World Series — 14 innings.

Is anyone else even close to leading the league in both of these very different and very fundamental aspects of baseball?

One of the questions asked of Dr. Ron Paul after his speech to the Robert Taft Club came from a guy I met at an Institute for Humane Studies (IHS) conference the previous summer. At that event, he was apoplectic after Randy Barnett's talk, in which the supposed Rothbardian outlined his justification of the state. We'll never be accepted by average Americans if we don't tailor our message and moderate our demands, my fellow IHS alum argued. I talked to him later in the week and he explained to me that while he was sympathetic to the free market, he considered himself a libertarian chiefly because he was a consistent social liberal who despised the restrictive social atmosphere that conservatives advocate. A beltway libertarian if there ever was one!

""Congressman, I have tremendous respect for you,"" the IHS alum averred, ""but I was shocked to read in a Reason Magazine profile that you actually stuff earmarks into appropriation bills just like every other member of Congress and I thought you were different, sir, ah, you of course vote against the bill, but I was curious how you could justify stuffing earmarks just like every other member of Congress"" (see here at 4:25). Dr. Paul's response is clear and convincing, but I'd like to go into more depth here. The issue is complicated and while earmark critics have some reasonable points, Dr. Paul's earmarking is ultimately not at odds with his philosophy.

As Paul notes in his answer, cutting the number of earmarks does not cut spending. An earmark is a congressional provision that directs federal agencies to spend funds already authorized on specific projects. If the funds aren't earmarked, the agencies can spend the money any way they see fit. That is, the executive branch, rather than Congress, will determine how the taxpayer's money is spent. This point cannot be stressed enough because even the writers at the Wall Street Journal do not understand it. After quoting a spokesman from Paul's office reminding them that earmarks do not directly increase spending, the WSJ reports, ""On the other hand, good libertarians should want to start cutting somewhere."" Didn't Paul's office just point out that cutting earmarks does not cut spending? Some argue that earmarks can indirectly increase spending by encouraging corruption — this problem will be dealt with below — but in this passage the WSJ seems to imply that adding earmarks directly increases spending. After writing that good libertarians should start cutting somewhere, they continue:

The problem with earmarking is that each year the habit grows by leaps and bounds so that it now represents real money. It is also a gateway to political corruption — a la Duke Cunningham, and other Congressmen currently under investigation for trading favors for earmarks. [Emphasis added]

By writing ""it is also,"" the writers imply that in addition to increasing spending, earmarks encourage corruption rather than the more coherent argument that earmarks increase spending by encouraging corruption.

Ramesh Ponnuru has more sense on this issue than most other mainstream movement conservatives. He recognizes that earmarks make up less than two percent of the federal budget and that fiscal conservatives should be spending more time and energy on more important spending programs. His response to Senator Jim DeMint's criticisms of the earmarking process, however, is less than convincing. ""The game,"" DeMint complained, ""encouraged everyone to be asking for money and everyone to be voting for bills that were bigger than the budget that had been voted for earlier."" Ponnuru counters that, ""It is certainly true, as DeMint says, that earmarks can buy support for government-expanding bills. But they can buy support for government-shrinking bills, too [like NAFTA]."" First, the hundreds of pages of legislation that created NAFTA did not shrink the size of government. Second, while it is conceivable that earmarks could be used to buy support for a government-shrinking bill, given the nature of government, the number of government-expanding bills is going to far outstrip the number of government-shrinking bills. On net, therefore, the quid pro quo of earmark trading is likely to increase government spending. Yet considering that Dr. Paul always votes ""no"" on the appropriations bills he requests earmarks for — as his critics concede — he is not involved in this negative aspect of the earmarking process. No amount of earmarks promised to him will convince him to vote ""yes"" on the bill. They are — as he says — projects meant to return some of his constituents' money that was stolen from them by the federal government, within the context of the current system. The excerpt of the Congressional Quarterly article that Tim Russert referenced (see 6:50) on the Meet the Press interview that reads, ""There isn't much that Rep. Ron Paul thinks the federal government should do…Apparently, though earmarks [that benefit his district] are okay,"" leaves the impression that Paul would support increasing the federal budget by $$400 million just to benefit his district. He would not. He supports forwarding the requests of his constituents that $$400 million of funds that the federal government has already taken from them and designated for spending be returned to their district.

Given that Paul isn't involved in the trading of earmarks for ""yes"" votes, his requests for earmarks must be judged on the other pros and cons of the practice. Earmarks can lead to ridiculously inefficient projects like the infamous ""Bridge to Nowhere"" because, critics contend, earmarked funds do not go through a merit-based selection process as they would if granted to an executive agency. It's not surprising that President Bush is a leading advocate of this argument. Ultimately this argument is part of a fruitless crusade to make government more efficient. But that is impossible. There is no way government can allocate resources rationally, no matter what part of it has the authority to dispense funds. The absence of market prices and the profit-and-loss mechanism makes it impossible for governments to accurately compare the value of inputs with outputs. No matter how many forms an executive agency makes you fill out to receive a grant, government cannot accurately measure merit. The phony free market Wall Street crowd's dream of cutting spending and streamlining government by empowering a unitary executive is both hopeless and fraught with danger. What if, for example, the WSJ gets its way and the president is given the line item veto? Couldn't the president, as Dr. Paul points out, threaten to cut funding from a recalcitrant congressman's district if he didn't support the president's proposed legislation?

Senator Tom Coburn claims that ""the Porkbusters represent what is arguably the only grassroots movement since 1994 to gain traction and build momentum on the core American principle of limited government"" [Emphasis in original]. I've lived in DC for almost four years now and I've been involved with the beltway conservative/libertarian crowd since the beginning. I was working on the earmark issue before it became national news. The enthusiasm for the ""Porkbusters"" coalition in no way approaches the popularity and dedication of the Ron Paul Revolution, a movement dedicated to the wholesale dismantling of large swaths of the federal government. Barry Goldwater was right. Moderation isn't all it's cracked up to be. True free market supporters should stop bickering over the way less than two percent of the budget is allocated and start focusing on scraping whole departments, gutting the military industrial complex, and privatizing entitlements.

The recently discovered tape on which Barack Obama said back in 1998 that he believes in redistribution is not really news. He said the same thing to Joe the Plumber four years ago. But the surfacing of this tape may serve a useful purpose if it gets people to thinking about what the consequences of redistribution are.

Those who talk glibly about redistribution often act as if people are just inert objects that can be placed here and there, like pieces on a chess board, to carry out some grand design. But if human beings have their own responses to government policies, then we cannot blithely assume that government policies will have the effect intended.

The history of the 20th century is full of examples of countries that set out to redistribute wealth and ended up redistributing poverty. The communist nations were a classic example, but by no means the only example.

In theory, confiscating the wealth of the more successful people ought to make the rest of the society more prosperous. But when the Soviet Union confiscated the wealth of successful farmers, food became scarce. As many people died of starvation under Stalin in the 1930s as died in Hitler’s Holocaust in the 1940s.

How can that be? It is not complicated. You can only confiscate the wealth that exists at a given moment. You cannot confiscate future wealth — and that future wealth is less likely to be produced when people see that it is going to be confiscated. Farmers in the Soviet Union cut back on how much time and effort they invested in growing their crops, when they realized that the government was going to take a big part of the harvest. They slaughtered and ate young farm animals that they would normally keep tending and feeding while raising them to maturity.

People in industry are not inert objects either. Moreover, unlike farmers, industrialists are not tied to the land in a particular country.

Russian aviation pioneer Igor Sikorsky could take his expertise to America and produce his planes and helicopters thousands of miles away from his native land. Financiers are even less tied down, especially today, when vast sums of money can be dispatched electronically to any part of the world.

If confiscatory policies can produce counterproductive repercussions in a dictatorship, they are even harder to carry out in a democracy. A dictatorship can suddenly swoop down and grab whatever it wants. But a democracy must first have public discussions and debates. Those who are targeted for confiscation can see the handwriting on the wall, and act accordingly.

Among the most valuable assets in any nation are the knowledge, skills and productive experience that economists call “human capital.” When successful people with much human capital leave the country, either voluntarily or because of hostile governments or hostile mobs whipped up by demagogues exploiting envy, lasting damage can be done to the economy they leave behind.

Fidel Castro’s confiscatory policies drove successful Cubans to flee to Florida, often leaving much of their physical wealth behind. But poverty-stricken refugees rose to prosperity again in Florida, while the wealth they left behind in Cuba did not prevent the people there from being poverty stricken under Castro. The lasting wealth the refugees took with them was their human capital.

We have all heard the old saying that giving a man a fish feeds him only for a day, while teaching him to fish feeds him for a lifetime. Redistributionists give him a fish and leave him dependent on the government for more fish in the future.

If the redistributionists were serious, what they would want to distribute is the ability to fish, or to be productive in other ways. Knowledge is one of the few things that can be distributed to people without reducing the amount held by others.

That would better serve the interests of the poor, but it would not serve the interests of politicians who want to exercise power, and to get the votes of people who are dependent on them.

Barack Obama can endlessly proclaim his slogan of “Forward,” but what he is proposing is going backwards to policies that have failed repeatedly in countries around the world.

Yet, to many people who cannot be bothered to stop and think, redistribution sounds good.

219902,"Christianity and War; And Other Essays against the Warfare State

by Laurence M. Vance (Pensacola, Fla.: Vance Publications, 2005); 118 pages.

When asked to name his favorite political philosopher in late 1999 during a debate with other Republicans in the campaign for the presidential nomination, George W. Bush named Jesus Christ. Bush’s support from Christian groups and voters is widely known, and the turnout of millions of evangelical Christians has been largely credited for his reelection.

From the point of view of even more millions of Americans, Bush and the Republican Party affirm and uphold their Christian morals and patriotic pride better than do Democratic candidates such as John Kerry. Most of America’s large Christian population lean conservative; and Bush’s public pronouncements of faith in Jesus Christ, along with his rhetorical appeals to classic American values, have undoubtedly garnered support from many Christians who feel proud to have a vocally Christian president representing them, rather than a supposedly paganistic chief executive such as Bill Clinton.

One very important factor in all this is the perception that Bush will not waver in defending America — in that he is supposedly more certain than other politicians, especially Democratic ones, to wage war aggressively in the Middle East. Not a few Christians see the war on terrorism as a crusade — as Bush once called it — and not only in metaphorical terms; indeed as a genuine clash of civilizations that has pitted the Christian West against Islam. Combining this religious fervor with a nationalist pride, millions of American hawks see the civilizing forces of freedom-loving Christian America engaged in a battle for survival with Muslim foreigners who hate our freedom.

Does the Christian case for war withstand serious scrutiny? Should people agree with the Rev. Jerry Falwell that God is pro-war? We know that Bush has hardly honored his campaign promise in 2000 for a more humble foreign policy, but has he acted consistently with his claim that he draws his political philosophy from Jesus? If the answer is no on all counts, are any of the lessons taught by anti-war Christian scholars on the evils of war universally applicable and useful to those who might not strictly identify with Christianity but nevertheless respect the positive and unspeakably large impact of Christian values in fostering principles of liberty and peace in the development of Western civilization?

In some senses, America is not technically a Christian nation at all, and yet, in others, the importance of Christian principles in the birth of America becomes clear in the writings of even the most deistic and agnostic of the Founding Fathers. The universal significance of Christianity in our culture is stark. What Christians throughout America regard as legitimately Christian or diabolically un-Christian viewpoints, especially as they relate to government policies as important as war, affects us all. That cannot be denied.

How wonderful it is, given all of this, that Laurence Vance has made available a selection of his writings in a book entitled Christianity and War; And Other Essays against the Warfare State, which contains 13 essays, four of which focus on explicitly Christian themes and nine of which more generally address war and empire and why all Americans should oppose the immoral, un-American — and, yes, sinful — institution of aggressive mass killing known as the U.S. military, at least in its current context. The essays are all readable and informative and explain why any American who takes seriously moral and political principles, drawn from Scripture and religious teachings as well as from America’s Founders and sheer reason, must eschew the U.S. warfare state in its present form, and, indeed, in the form it has taken for more than 100 years.

Religion and war

Attempting to reach people on the merits of peace and the perils of war is not always easy, particularly when they hold tightly to what they believe are teachings of their religious faith that validate or even endorse war. With millions of Christian Americans drawing their attitudes toward war from the bloodthirsty lessons of pro-war clergymen, it is not too surprising, but nevertheless disappointing, to see so many replace faith in God with faith in the state, and respect for the teachings of the Prince of Peace with the calls for blood coming from the god of war. Even many pro-war American Catholics deferred to Bush, but not to the Pope, in the run-up to the Iraq War.

In addressing, point by point, Falwell’s interpretation of Scripture, Vance rebuts the notion that, in Falwell’s words, God is pro-war:

We know from the Bible that God is pro-holiness and pro-righteousness, but to say that God is pro-war doesn’t sound like any description I have ever read in a systematic theology book. Was God pro-Crimean War? Was God pro-War of the Austrian Succession? Was God pro-War of the Roses? Whose side was [he] on in these conflicts? What Falwell really means is that God is pro-American wars. Falwell’s shameless pseudo-patriotism is a violation of the third commandment in the Bible he professes to believe: Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain.

It is here that we see Vance’s central and crucially insightful thesis: American Christians have, by and large, transformed faith in God into faith in the American nation-state, especially as it regards war. But war, as Vance convincingly argues, stands in conflict with the vast bulk of time-honored Christian tradition and literature. Compellingly citing the Bible, Vance demonstrates that blind obedience to and trust in the state directly contradict obedience to and trust in God.

Quite intriguing is Vance’s exposition in the title essay of Hugo Grotius’s Just War Theory, as it pertains to both just cause and just practices in war. War must have

just cause (correct intention [self-defense] with an objective), proportionality (grave enough situation to warrant war), reasonable chance for success (attainable objectives), public declaration (fair warning, opportunity for avoidance), declaration only by legitimate authority, and last resort (all other options eliminated).

Furthermore, even a justly started defensive war must be conducted only against legitimate targets and must respect the doctrines of proportionality and the fair treatment of prisoners.

Many U.S. wars have failed miserably by these standards, and a great many of them have failed on every count. Unfortunately, many Christians defend most of these wars, and some of them were even waged, at least implicitly, in the name of Christianity. (One absurd example that comes to mind is the claim given at the time of the Spanish-American War that the U.S. government was working to Christianize the already mostly Christian population in the Philippines — an intervention that, as Vance reminds us, took the lives of more than 200,000 people, mostly civilians.) That Christianity would be abused in the name of aggressive war is nothing new, however. Vance quotes Veritatis Amans in an essay from 1847:

Many of the wars whose desolating surges have divulged the earth, have been carried out in the name and under the sanction of those who profess the name of Christ.

Two of Vance’s most hard-hitting essays — Should a Christian Join the Military? and Christian Killers? — do not pull any punches in outlining the urgent conflict personally lived by those Christians who are currently carrying out orders for the U.S. military in its aggressive actions. In one profound section in the first of these articles, Vance lays out the case that the U.S. military violates every single Commandment in the Ten Commandments. In the second article, he explores the curious fact that many Christians see less contradiction in the term Christian killers than they might in similarly oxymoronic phrases, such as Christian pimps or Christian adulterers.

Morality and war

As noted earlier, Vance’s book holds significance not only for Christians but for all who are interested in the moral case against war and reasoned critiques against blind allegiance to the warfare state. Even in the essays focusing on Christianity, he has lots of ecumenically useful information, such as a brief summary of the lies told by America’s principal warmongering presidents from James Polk to both George Bushes. He appeals to universal morality, explaining why Christians and non-Christians alike should oppose aggressive war, with such parallel questions as Should a Christian join the military? Should anyone join the military?

However, the distinctly Christian arguments against war may prove among the most interesting content in the book, even to the non-Christian anti-war American, as they weave together a tidy summary of religious principles of peace heard all too seldom these days. Just as one does not need to be an atheist to find value in anti-war reasoning based on the inherently secular values of Objectivism, especially in these days when all too many Objectivists favor war, so too does one not need to be a Christian to recognize the strength in anti-war reasoning based on Christianity, especially in these days when all too many Christians likewise favor war. More than simply appealing to the authority of Christianity — which, with his scriptural citations, the author does quite well — Vance is making a reasoned argument that Christians are holding contradictory positions if they claim to follow both Christ and the secular god of war.

Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, articles 5 through 13 focus not on Christianity and war, but on war itself. Vance has sections on the evils of war, specific wars, and the nature of the U.S. empire, all of which have undeniable universal appeal but which also tie in nicely with his earlier essays, forming a cohesive collection of arguments in his attempt to reach fellow Christians who have been misled into supporting war.

One of the most impressive of these essays is Jefferson on the Evils of War. If Christian Americans have strayed from their faith to cheer on the warfare state, all pro-war Americans have neglected the principles of one of our greatest Founding Fathers in doing so. Instead of dropping only a couple of gems, as many do in citing Jefferson’s inclinations toward peace, Vance supplies more than 11 pages of valuable quotations chronicling his consistent opposition to war. I have seen enough of one war never to wish to see another, said Jefferson, who abhor[ed] war and view[ed] it as the greatest scourge of mankind. Vance shows how Jefferson’s opinions on aggressive war were not ambiguous, as he documents the Founding Father’s general opposition to it as well as his specific observations concerning the American experience, the formalities of declaring war legitimately, and standing armies.

Standing armies

On this last all-too neglected issue alone, Vance presents wonderful arguments against what the Founding Fathers considered a principal grievance in their own time: standing armies during peacetime. Thomas Jefferson named standing armies as a tyrannical component of the British Crown in the Declaration of Independence and described them as

instruments so dangerous to the rights of the nation and which place them so totally at the mercy of their governors that those governors, whether legislative or executive, should be restrained from keeping such instruments on foot but in well-defined cases.

Vance not only consults Jefferson on the evils of standing armies, but devotes large portions of two other essays on the subject, each one drawing on an important voice in the history of America’s founding: Brutus, the pseudonym credited with 16 virtually forgotten essays written in opposition to the Federalist Papers and the ratification of the Constitution; and Cato, the pseudonym credited with the collection of 144 essays, known together as Cato’s Letters, which made the case for liberty in Britain in the early 1720s and were a source of inspiration for the American revolutionaries half a century later.

The Anti-Federalists for whom Brutus spoke had many reservations about the Constitution, not the least of which was standing armies. As Vance puts it,

In four of his sixteen essays … he explains how the establishment and maintenance of standing armies breeds fear, is destructive to liberty, and should be viewed as a scourge to a country instead of a benefit.

In Brutus’s words,

The power of the federal legislative, to raise and support armies at pleasure, as well in peace as in war, and their controul over the militia, tend, not only to a consolidation of the government, but the destruction of liberty.

Vance includes other thought-provoking quotations from Brutus, including his engagement with Alexander Hamilton on the issue of standing armies.

In discussing Cato’s Letters, Vance shows that their early classical liberalism, much like the Anti-Federalist principles of Brutus and the individualism of Thomas Jefferson, had little sympathy for war. The 1720s essays preferred commerce to conquest and, in their own words, strongly opposed the rulers who

[engaged] their country in ridiculous, expensive, fantastical wars, to keep the minds of men in continual hurry and agitation, and under constant feats and alarms.

Cato called standing armies standing curses in every country under the sun, where they are more powerful than the people; opined that it is certain, that all parts of Europe which are enslaved, have been enslaved by armies; and that it is impossible, that any nation which keeps them amongst themselves can long preserve their liberties; claimed never to have met with one honest and reasonable man out of power who was not heartily against standing armies; and contended that great empires cannot subsist without great armies, and liberty cannot subsist with them.

Vance’s presentation of Brutus’s, Cato’s, and Jefferson’s opposition to standing armies is particularly well worth pondering. What many chief philosophical architects of the American Revolution viewed as a sure sign and implement of tyranny, most Americans today, including many libertarians, regard as an acceptable, necessary, and obvious part of national security and the American way of life.

Vance also presents and substantiates eight little-known facts about Iraq, including that there was no country of Iraq until it was created by the British in 1920 and that the United States already sponsored two previous regime changes in Iraq. He discusses the Crimean War, which, he says, should have been the war to end all wars’ instead of being a precursor to the carnage of the war that made the world safe for democracy.’ And he addresses the horrible realities of combat and the terrible prevalence of war in the modern world. The last section of the book is filled with powerful documentation on how extensive the U.S. empire has become, providing lists of places in which the United States has intervened and continues to have an unnecessary military presence. He writes,

The total number of troops deployed abroad as of [September 30, 2003] was 253,764, not including U.S. troops in Iraq from the United States. Total military personnel on September 30, 2003, was 1,434,277. This means that 17.6 percent of U.S. military forces were deployed on foreign soil, and certainly over 25 percent if U.S. troops in Iraq from the United States were included. But regardless of how many troops we have in each country, having troops in 135 countries is 135 countries too many.

Vance’s book provides an important contribution to the cause of peace. Readable, eloquent, and well-reasoned, it serves well in teaching the reader about the Christian principles of peace so often neglected by many of today’s Christian hawks; and it has the rare potential to appeal to and convince them of their error and inconsistencies. I recommend it as a delightfully engaging and quick read, both to win over Christian supporters of the war and to enlighten non-Christians as to the true Christian outlook on war and empire.

The need for returning America to peace and nonintervention has perhaps never been greater. It has perhaps never been more important to make the case for peace. For these reasons, it is crucial that the arguments for peace be made clearly, cogently, and often, within as many philosophical frameworks and ideological groups as possible. It is vitally necessary and useful to reach audiences who support the war in glaring contradiction to other beliefs to which they claim to swear total allegiance. For the potential Vance’s book has in reaching many who might not otherwise be reached, and for providing his readers with some very important rational and moral arguments against the war, Vance deserves the thanks of those of us who love peace and liberty and are working to see them restored to America.

KINGSTON, NY, 26 June 2012 — Gerald Celente's forecast is clear — The 2nd American Revolution is on the horizon. And this American Patriot has done more than just sign up to join the fight, he's established its headquarters.

Inspired by its potent symbolic value, Celente has purchased the 1750s ""Franz Roggen House,"" a stately stone colonial set on the northeast corner of John and Crown Streets, in Kingston's historic Stockade District. This is the only intersection in the United States that boasts pre-revolutionary stone buildings on all four corners.

""Kingston played a critical role in the 1st American Revolution and was, for a short while, the capitol of New York State,"" observes Celente. ""Here is where I'm taking my stand to start the 2nd American Revolution.""

""The 1st American Revolution was fought with armies and bullets,"" says Celente. ""The 2nd American Revolution will not cost lives and limbs; it will be fought with mind and spirit.""

Celente is unequivocal: ""America's democratic political system is degenerate, corrupt and ineffective. It cannot be patched up or papered over. Rather, it must be renewed, revived, and reconfigured from the ground up,"" he says. ""The potential for positive and sweeping change is there. It can happen, but it has to be made to happen.""

How? First, ""We the people"" must be made aware of the urgent need for real change. Then ""we"" must learn to accept and embrace the concept of a full-scale intellectual revolution. ""The time is ripe, Americans are u2018mad as hell and not going to take it anymore,'"" says Celente, who predicts that the November election will be the turning point. ""The polls prove it. There is little enthusiasm for either candidate and, once again, Americans will be left with no choice other than the choice of the lesser of two evils.

""Stay Home, Don't Vote!""

Celente's Revolutionary call to arms begins with a voter's strike. ""Stay Home, Don't Vote"" is his campaign slogan. ""People have been conned into believing that if you don't vote you've lost the right to complain. That's political baloney,"" fumes Celente. ""The true case is exactly the opposite. This is a two-headed, one party system. Republican or Democrat, considering their track records, it's clear nothing can be expected from either Presidential candidate other than the perpetuation of the destructive and criminal policies that have brought America to its current state of perpetual crisis and socioeconomic decline. Ditto for Congress.""

""What self-respecting person would cast a vote for a lesser of two evils?"" asks Celente. ""Not only is it immoral and undignified, it's destructive. Lesser or greater, evil is evil. By supporting one evil or the other, the voter becomes an accessory to the crime. Only a true intellectual revolution can restore dignity, trust, morality, decency and compassion.""

""Anything else is just more of the same. Stay Home, Don't Vote!""

As far as Celente is concerned, ""We can change course, restore our country and regain our independence. United, the American people have the power to prevail and create a more u2018perfect Union.'""

Gerald Celente is founder and director of The Trends Research Institute, author of Trends 2000 and Trend Tracking (Warner Books), and publisher of The Trends Journal. He has been forecasting trends since 1980, and recently called The Collapse of '09.

very strange is going on. It has been going on since August. The

U.S. money supply is shrinking.

Consider

the charts published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

The St. Louis FED has been diligent for decades in making available

charts and tables regarding the money supply, as well as other

key statistics. I trust the long-term consistency of this information.

If you will

see for yourself what is going on, you will be able to understand

this report with less confusion, meaning your confusion will stay

even with mine. I assure you, what the graphs reveal has confused

me. But I think it’s better for all concerned if we see the evidence

before we start speculating about causes.

First,

take a look at MZM, ""money of zero maturity."" This

indicator I regard as the most relevant monetary indicator, because

it is closest to the characteristic feature of money: instant

spendability. Here, the decline is most prominent.

This is not

a minor downward blip. This is a full-scale decline. It has been

going on for six months. The free market, through its innumerable

transactions, is shrinking the money supply.

Second,

look at M-2. This is a traditional indicator. I have followed

it intermittently for three decades. The monetarist school of

economics, once led by Milton Friedman, used to pay more attention

to M-2, which includes time deposits (savings accounts), than

to M-1 (currency plus checking accounts), although I don’t know

if this is still true of most monetarists. This statistic tells

the same story, but less radically.

Third, look

at the adjusted

monetary base. This monetary component is the one that the

Federal Reserve System controls. It reveals the FED’s holdings

of assets, mainly U.S. government debt certificates. The monetary

base is what Friedman has called high-powered money. This base

supplies the reserves that the commercial banking system uses

to create loans, and hence money. Here, things are less clear.

Notice that the graph peaked in late October. It had gyrated after

late August. As you can see, the general trend was upward until

November. Then, it stabilized through December, and has now started

down.

What is going

on? If the monetary base is stable, at least peak to peak, but

MZM and M2 are falling, what is causing the disconnect between

FED monetary policy and the market’s use of monetary reserves?

One answer

is the

rise in the supply of currency, i.e., pieces of paper with

dead politicians’ pictures on them. There was a steady upward

move until late July. Then the rate of increase itself increased.

When currency

increases, the ability of the banking system to increase the number

of loans decreases. When a depositor goes to his bank and withdraws

currency, the bank can no longer use his money to make loans.

When he pulls out currency and refuses to deposit it in another

bank, the banking system cannot make new loans. The fractional

reserve money-expansion process reverses, imploding the money

supply by multiples of the face value of the currency withdrawn.

The banks must call in old loans. When the currency supply rises

faster than the increase of the monetary base, banks cannot increase

the money they lend by the same percentage increase as the monetary

base.

Since August,

the monetary base has stayed almost constant. The currency component

of the money supply has increased. So far, this tells us that

the non-currency components of the money supply must have fallen.

So, I went looking for other statistics that would verify what

the logic of money tells us. I did not have to go far. This chart

tells us: the public is pulling currency out of the banking system

by cashing in (i.e., cashing out) its small

time deposits.

While no

one is using the terminology, we may be witnessing a bank run.

This is not a panic-driven bank run, like something out of the

Great Depression. This is a steady bank run that is motivated

by something other than fear.

THRIFT

DOESN’T PAY MUCH

When the

Federal Reserve Board decided in 2001 to fight the recession and

then fight the after-effects of 9-11, it pumped money into the

economy. Its answer to recession was monetary inflation. This

is the FED’s usual response.

The combination,

a rising money supply and falling demand for commercial loans,

produced the sharpest decline in the federal funds rate in my

lifetime. The federal funds rate is the rate at which commercial

banks lend money to each other overnight, in order for lending

banks that have temporarily overshot their legal reserve limit

to maintain legal reserves for their loans. The fed funds rate

has remained in the 1% range for almost two years.

As the interest

rate on savings accounts has fallen, small, risk-averse savers

have been hit hard. Someone with $$100,000 in a savings account

in 2000 was earning $$2,000 to $$3,000 a year. For the last two

years, he has earned under $$1,000 a year, maybe as little as $$600.

Last May, one survey

reported the following: the typical saver was losing money!

Bankrate.com’s

spring 2003 survey of passbook and statement savings interest

rates shows that interest rates are continuing to plummet. Once

again, rates have reached an all-time low since Bankrate.com

began tracking these rates in 1987.

The national

average interest rate for passbook accounts is 0.60 percent.

That’s down from 0.80 percent last fall and 0.87 a year ago.

Passbook accounts, in which customers track their deposits and

withdrawals in a little book, are fairly rare.

Traditionally,

passbook accounts have paid less than the more modern statement

savings account. But in this survey, the results are equally

dismal. The national average for statement savings accounts

is 0.60 percent, down from 0.82 last fall and 0.92 a year ago.

If you

put $$500 in a savings account and left it there for a year,

you’d get $$3 interest, since the rate and the yield are the

same. If you were in the 27 percent tax bracket, that $$3 would

be whittled down to $$2.19. Subtract 3 percent for inflation

and you have about $$487 in buying power.

That was

May. By October, the

national average for banks was under 0.4%.

In July,

the rise in currency and the decline in time deposits accelerated.

It is understandable why. People who held time deposits were being

paid so little for their thrift — negative, after taxes and price

inflation — that they might as well pull their money out of the

bank.

A person

who has currency can buy and sell without leaving a paper trail.

He can pocket any profits. He has his money close at hand.

Someone else

can send money to relatives abroad. I heard recently that Mexicans

sent $$14 billion to relatives last year. Most of that money, I

suspect, was in currency. I also imagine that more than $$14 billion

was sent. Immigrants send money home. The paper dollar serves

as a second currency in third world nations.

The FED decided

to stimulate the economy in 2001 by pumping in new money. Lo and

behold, this policy is now backfiring. It has produced such low

rates of investment return for savers that they are pulling currency

out of the banks. This has created an anomaly: a fall in the money

supply, or at least a fall in the various money supply statistics.

There may

be better explanations out there for the anomaly of a falling

money supply, however defined, despite a stable monetary base.

What amazes me is that there is so little discussion today in

the financial press about the existence of this anomaly, let alone

its implications for financial markets.

""PUSHING

ON A STRING""

This phrase

has been used to describe central bank policy in a time of recession.

The central bank increases the monetary base, but commercial banks

don’t respond by lending to the public. They buy government bonds

instead. The problem is, this phrase has not generally been applied

to an economy that is in a recovery phase. It is always applied

to an economy in a recession.

The FED today

is not pushing on a string. It is sitting on the string. It is

not pumping in new money. It is pulling reserves out of the system,

though so slowly that this may be a statistical blip. But the

money supply is falling, according to standard measures. Yet

prices continue to rise, although in the low 2% per annum range

(median cpi).

The economy

seems to be recovering. The stock market is up. Gold is up. The

euro is up. The dollar is down internationally. Yet from the statistics,

we learn that the FED is not inflating, the money supply is falling,

and prices are rising, but only mildly.

Thus, all

of the major forecasting systems seem to be stymied. There is

no pattern that makes sense, according to the economic models

that I am familiar with.

I see this

as a warning. Be suspicious these days of anyone who has a quick

explanation. You now have seen the charts. The charts at present

do not seem to conform to any theoretical framework of economic

explanation that I see in newsletters or the financial press.

Newsletter

writers must exude confidence in their systems, but this confidence

ought to be related at least loosely to the basics of monetary

policy. It is better to point out the anomalies than to conceal

them for the sake of preserving an illusion of confidence.

Money is

not the whole story, but it is a large component of any financial

story. What we are seeing is Federal Reserve policy — monetary

stability — that is being thwarted by individual decision-makers

beyond the Beltway and beyond the New York financial district.

The FED isn’t pushing or pulling on the monetary string, but depositors

are making decisions to pull out currency. There may be other

factors in the decline of the money supply, but the currency component’s

direction is the most obvious: upward. This produces a downward

move in time deposits.

There is

another plausible explanation, one suggested to me by Joe Cobb.

People may be switching from time deposits (0% reserve) to checking

accounts (10% reserve), thereby shrinking both M-2 and MZM, but

not M-1. Seasonally adjusted, M-1 is falling, but not seasonally

adjusted, it is up slightly. This would suggest the public’s loss

of faith in saving at today’s rates, but not a run into currency.

But there is this limiting factor at work: the advent of “sweeps,”

in which customers’ money in checking accounts (10% reserve) are

moved overnight to savings accounts (0% reserve), and then moved

back into checking accounts the next day, has reduced

to 30% the number of banks bound by reserve requirements.

Perhaps Alan Greenspan will offer his opinion on this the next

time he testifies to Congress. This assumes, of course, that some

elected official bothers to ask him.

One thing

is clear: the FED is pursuing a stable money policy with the main

tool that it has: the monetary base. All discussion of the U.S.

economy today should begin here.

CONCLUSION

What we are

seeing is a fall in the dollar internationally that is not based

on the FED’s pushing on the string by pumping in new money. Right

now, FED policy looks neutral. But the fall in the money supply

is not neutral.

The rise

in gold’s price is not taking place as an inflation hedge. It

is taking place parallel to the decline of the dollar against

the euro. There is something more fundamental going on here than

traditional inflation hedging, or so it seems to me. There is

a move against the dollar that is not based on fear of inflation.

I think we are seeing the beginning of a shift away from the dollar

as the world’s primary reserve currency. What has prevailed since

1940 is beginning to change.

I am cogitating

on this. Who knows? I may come up with an answer and win the Nobel

Prize in economics. The question is: Will the Nobel Committee

pay me in dollars or euros? I’m hoping for euros.

375602,"They are the songs you cannot get out of your head. Now scientists may have found a way to help anyone plagued by those annoying tunes that lodge themselves inside our heads and repeat on an endless loop.

Researchers claim the best way to stopping the phenomenon, sometimes known as earworms – where snippets of a catchy song inexplicably play like a broken record in your brain – is to solve some tricky anagrams.

This can force the intrusive music out of your working memory, they say, allowing it to be replaced with other more amenable thoughts.

But they also warn not to try anything too difficult as those irritating melodies may wiggle their way back into your consciousness.

For those unwilling to carry around a book of anagrams, a good novel may also do the trick.

“The key is to find something that will give the right level of challenge,” said Dr Ira Hyman, a music psychologist at Western Washington University who conducted the research. “If you are cognitively engaged, it limits the ability of intrusive songs to enter your head.

“Something we can do automatically like driving or walking means you are not using all of your cognitive resource, so there is plenty of space left for that internal jukebox to start playing.

“Likewise, if you are trying something too hard, then your brain will not be engaged successfully, so that music can come back. You need to find that bit in the middle where there is not much space left in the brain. That will be different for each individual.

“It is like a Goldilocks effect – it can’t be too easy and it can’t be too hard, it has got to be just right.”

Dr Hyman and his team conducted a series of tests on volunteers by playing them popular songs in an attempt to find out how tunes can become stuck in long term memory.

By playing songs by the Beatles, Lady Gaga and Beyoncé while the volunteers completed mazes drawn out on pieces of paper, they found they could get songs to play mentally in the participants heads and that they were then likely to recur intrusively through the next day.

They then tested whether performing puzzles such as Sudoku or anagrams would help to reduce the recurrence of the earworms.

They found that while Sudoku puzzles could help prevent the songs from replaying their heads, if they were too difficult it had little effect.

Anagrams were more successful and they found that solving those with five letters gave the best results.

“Verbal tasks like solving anagrams or reading a good novel seem to be very good at keeping earworms out,” said Dr Hyman, who now hopes to examine whether similar techniques could be used to prevent other intrusive thoughts caused by anxiety or obsessiveness.

I monitor a chart on a website that almost no economic forecaster pays any attention to. The chart has indicated a remarkable shift toward economic optimism. It has indicated that the American economy will not fall into recession this year. This shift has taken place in the last three weeks.

The problem with the chart and the site is that, by design, no explanations are ever offered. There is no theory of why the economy will or will not fall into recession. That is because the site is a gambling site. You pays your money and you takes your chances.

The site is Intrade. It is a web-based site. It is run from Dublin. If the owner ever sets foot on U.S. soil, he will be arrested, tried, convicted, and sent to jail. But he can afford to stay out of the United States. He is a very rich bookie.

The site allows gamblers to make bets on future events to take place or not take place during a defined time frame. One of these listed events is recession in the U.S. in 2008. As recently as mid-April, betting was over 70% that there will be a recession this year. Then, without warning, the odds turned the other way. Today, the odds are 27%.

This is a major shift of opinion. In the sports world, it would be as if Michael Jordan had been seriously injured mid-season when he played for the Bulls. You can see the chart here.

A law passed in 2006 that prohibits U.S.-based banks from making credit card payments to off-shore gambling sites: The Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006. So, the betters on Intrade are not Americans, other than Americans who have opened off-shore bank accounts and who use foreign post office boxes as their addresses. This is not many Americans. The site is limited to those few Americans who value their privacy and who want a way to make payments even if the government closes certain doors, either on all Americans or on them personally.

So, the chart reflects foreigners’ assessments of U.S. economic prospects in 2008. They were very pessimistic in mid-April. They are no longer pessimistic today.

The magnitude of the shift and the speed of the shift are what caught my attention. These are not marginal moves.

How do the gamblers define “recession”? As the National Bureau of Economic Research is widely believed to define it, but in fact doesn’t.

For expiry purposes, a recession is defined as two successive quarters of negative real GDP growth.

Expiry will be based solely on the data reported by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Bureau of Economic Analysis, Table 1.1.1, “Percent Change From Preceding Period in Real Gross Domestic Product”) as reported by the BEA.

This is how most

informed American investors define a recession.

WHY TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY?

For well over a century, statisticians have known that predictions made by large numbers of people — over a thousand — are more accurate than predictions made by experts. This phenomenon was discovered by Charles Darwin’s cousin, Francis Galton, who was a statistician. He did an experiment at a county fair. He asked a large number of attendees to estimate the butchered weight of an ox. There was a contest to see who could estimate it most accurately. He found that the average of the estimate was more accurate than the guesses made by livestock experts.

This phenomenon has been repeated for over a century. Again and again, the results are the same. An average of the guesses turns out to be very accurate. This fact and some of its implications were summarized in a best-selling book in 2004, The Wisdom of Crowds, by James Surowiecki.

Over the last few years, there have been several websites set up that allow people to guess about future events. Some of them use play money to stay out of the government’s clutches. One is set up as a commodity futures exchange, which is legal for bets (investments) under $$500. Then there are the foreign gambling sites.

These sites post the results of the bets. They publish charts. I monitor some of these charts, just to see what’s happening in the world of non-sports betting. I especially pay attention to sites where gambling is for real money. Intrade is one of the largest. It merged with TradeSports several years ago.

Galton’s discovery confirms an important insight of free market economists, most notably F. A. Hayek. In his most important article, “The Use of Knowledge in Society” (1945), Hayek argued that central economic planning cannot be as efficient as free market economic planning because central panning boards cannot accumulate or accurately assess the information possessed by the investing public. Knowledge is decentralized. No man knows more than a sliver of this knowledge.

The supreme task of society, Hayek argued, is to gain access to the best knowledge available. This can be done only through private ownership, the legal right to exchange, and the profit-and-loss system. Central planning interferes with all three.

Galton’s discovery is a specific application of Hayek’s general theory regarding decentralized knowledge. It seems that the highly specific knowledge possessed by large numbers of people is superior to expert knowledge possessed by a handful of individuals.

This is bad news for investment advisors as well as central planners. I think this is why we see so few references to these new prediction market sites. Investment advisors do not want to think a bookie has access to more accurate knowledge than they do.

The thought that the bookie then posts a chart in the free section of his website . . . well, it’s clearly un-American. I know this must be true, because when a free market economist, Robin Hanson, recommended the creation of a betting site for future terrorist acts, in order to better assess their likelihood, there was such a firestorm of criticism from Congress that the Defense Department dropped the idea the day after news of the suggestion hit the media. When a free market solution for a better system than the colored terrorism alert system used by the government, Congress saw red. That was in 2003. It seems even more un-American today.

Yet few Americans know that this same technique was used in 1968 to locate the sunk American submarine, The Scorpion. I first read about this years ago in the book, Blind Man’s Bluff. It had been recommended to me by a retired captain of a submarine. This story is summarized by Prof. Arthur Rubenstein.

The Navy had all but given up hope of finding the submarine when John Craven, who was their top deep-water scientist, came up with a plan which pre-dated the explosion of interest in prediction markets by decades. He simply turned to a group of submarine and salvage experts and asked them to bet on the probabilities of what could have happened. Taking an average of their responses, he was able to identify the location of the missing vessel to within a furlong (220 yards) of its actual location. The sub was found.

IF THIS IS NOT A RECESSION. . . .

So far this year, we have seen a higher unemployment rate, a decline in the median price of the American home, widespread consumer pessimism, rising personal debt, a manufacturing sector in a recession (reports the Institute for Supply Management), large commercial banks in big trouble for bad mortgage loans, the financial industry in turmoil (Bear Stearns, Carlyle Capital Corporation), the threat of a bailout by Congress of foreclosed houses, a decline in sales in the auto industry — even Toyota — with no end in sight, and the Federal Reserve System in panic mode. Even Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway shares have fallen from $$150,000 to $$125,000 since mid-December. Yet, in terms of the GDP figures, the economy is not yet in a recession.

If this is not a recession, I don’t like to think about recession.

The fact that European gamblers do not think the U.S. will have a recession in 2008 is good news, but how good? With non-recession economic conditions what they have been so far this year, the good news is consistent with continuing bad news. It just isn’t super-bad news.

The U.S. stock market has not reflected a shift in opinion comparable to the magnitude of the shift on Intrade. It is still below 14,000, which it reached last November.

Interest rates on Treasury debt is low, with T-bills under 2%. This is consistent with fears of recession. Investors are accepting a taxable rate of return that is below the official rate of price inflation. Why are they willing to do this? Because they fear the loss of their capital.

If investors believe that a boom is imminent, they would shift back to the stock market. So far, they haven’t.

WHICH STOCKS?

There is an addiction known as “buy a stock index fund and hold.” I call it an addiction because, ever since its peak in March 2000, stock indexes have fallen. The NASDAQ is less than half of where it was in 2000. The S&P 500 is down from the mid-1500’s to the 1400 range. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up slightly, but not if we factor in the 21% increase in consumer prices. Yet at no time did the “buy and hold” crowd ever tell their readers to get out of stocks. I did: in February and March of 2000.

So, these people have been conditioned to ignore economic reality. No matter what happens, they are told to buy and hold. When the indexes are down, eight years after their peak, the “buy stocks” promoters start recommending sectors. But this advice is counter to the original “buy and hold a no-load index fund.” This is speculating to beat the indexes. This is inconsistent with the buy-and-hold theory.

I realize that most of my readers hold stocks. They have taken a beating for eight years, but they still believe the experts. (By the way, the experts also did not forecast the decline in housing prices. I started warning readers to get out in April of 2005.)

If you own stocks, why not Asian stocks? Asia is clearly the wave of the future. They are where the economic growth is. Why buy shares in a low-growth nation that is running a $$700 billion to $$800 billion balance of payments deficit every year? Why buy the shares in a nation whose national government is running $$400 billion annual on-budget deficits and has an unfunded off-budget Social Security/Medicare liability of over $$70 trillion?

Most important, when your income is in dollars, shouldn’t your investments be in assets denominated in foreign currencies? Isn’t this what portfolio diversification is all about? Of course it is, but the experts rarely mention that, in order to be diversified, you retirement portfolio must be diversified out of the currency unit in which your monthly salary is denominated.

I am not convinced that Asia’s stock markets will rise during the later phases of the real estate crisis. This crisis is international. It has barely begun. But if you use a buy-and-hold strategy, the case for Asian stocks is far stronger than the case for American stocks.

DEBT

The American economy is Keynesian. It is debt-driven. Every aspect of it rests on the increase of debt. Yet it is already the biggest debtor nation in history.

Private household debt is under significant pressure today. With the reversal of housing equity, the home equity loans, called HELOCs, are becoming more difficult to secure. People need higher credit scores. As the housing market continues to suffer equity losses, banks will be forced to reduce this lucrative source of income.

When will this happen? I think it will happen in September, when the summer house-buying season is over and the foreclosure market is still glutted with unsold, empty houses. The lenders will have to begin to foreclose in earnest this fall. We have seen only the preliminary phase of foreclosures so far. The lenders are hoping against hope that the borrowers will be able to make payments again. This is not going to happen.

In my previous report, “Real Estate Maps of Doom,” I discussed the extent of the crisis. It pointed to the institutional problem facing the lenders: centralization. This is the product of government intervention into the housing market coupled with academic theories of asset pricing that ignored the effect of the policies of Greenspan’s Federal Reserve era. I wrote:

The lenders are huge, centralized conglomerates. They bought pooled packages of real estate loans. This was all very scientific, the lenders were told. It diversified risk.

This crisis is not like previous housing crises. There is no local banker who made the loan with his bank’s assets. There is therefore no highly motivated local seller of a foreclosed property. There is no one locally with the authority to negotiate. Centralization lowered costs getting into the deals. It has dramatically increased costs of getting out.

This system is

locked up. No one is willing to take responsibility for the growing

inventory of unsold houses. But eventually, accounting rule 157 will

force lenders to write down loans that are not performing. This is

the day of reckoning for the housing market.

But the foreclosure system is paralyzed. The locals have no authority to negotiate. The distant bureaucrats are insulated from reality. They dream of a government bailout. They don’t want to sell at the newer, lower prices, because this will force them to write down their loans’ value. They refuse to declare losses that the market has already imposed.

This is why I

regard the reversal in Intrade’s recession bet as overly optimistic.

The Europeans do not understand the effect of the accounting rules

on the housing market.

I am not willing to dismiss this betting market. This is the best single indicator that has signaled “no recession.” I take it far more seriously than I do any forecasting service that did not issue a warning in 2007 regarding the seriousness of this year’s economy.

CONCLUSION

The American economy has two major engines of growth: the housing market (debt) and the auto market (debt). Both are in recession.

The service sector may withstand the crisis in the largest manufacturing sectors. It may smooth out the economy so that it does not fall into recession, as defined — meaning undefined — by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The head of the NBER, Martin Feldstein, thinks the American economy is headed into recession.

Nevertheless, I am now ready to accept the counter-estimate of a bunch of faceless gamblers in Europe who have their own money on the line.

This is a case for optimism. It is not much of a case, but it’s the best anyone has offered so far this year.

I think the recession will arrive this year. I do not expect a severe recession. I also do not think the recovery will be strong or rapid. The slowdown will last for over a year. So will a depressed housing market. But I do take seriously Intrade’s assessment. We are less likely to have a recession than we were as recently as mid-April.

89973,"As over-leveraged investment houses began to fail in September 2008, the leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties, of major corporations, and opinion leaders stretching from the National Review magazine (and the Wall Street Journal) on the right to the Nation magazine on the left, agreed that spending some $700 billion to buy the investors’ ""toxic assets"" was the only alternative to the U.S. economy’s ""systemic collapse."" In this, President George W. Bush and his would-be Republican successor John McCain agreed with the Democratic candidate, Barack Obama. Many, if not most, people around them also agreed upon the eventual commitment of some 10 trillion nonexistent dollars in ways unprecedented in America. They explained neither the difference between the assets’ nominal and real values, nor precisely why letting the market find the latter would collapse America. The public objected immediately, by margins of three or four to one.

When this majority discovered that virtually no one in a position of power in either party or with a national voice would take their objections seriously, that decisions about their money were being made in bipartisan backroom deals with interested parties, and that the laws on these matters were being voted by people who had not read them, the term ""political class"" came into use. Then, after those in power changed their plans from buying toxic assets to buying up equity in banks and major industries but refused to explain why, when they reasserted their right to decide ad hoc on these and so many other matters, supposing them to be beyond the general public’s understanding, the American people started referring to those in and around government as the ""ruling class."" And in fact Republican and Democratic office holders and their retinues show a similar presumption to dominate and fewer differences in tastes, habits, opinions, and sources of income among one another than between both and the rest of the country. They think, look, and act as a class.

The Ruling Class: How ... Angelo M. Codevilla Best Price: $1.99 Buy New $3.12 (as of 04:30 EST - Details)

Although after the election of 2008 most Republican office holders argued against the Troubled Asset Relief Program, against the subsequent bailouts of the auto industry, against the several ""stimulus"" bills and further summary expansions of government power to benefit clients of government at the expense of ordinary citizens, the American people had every reason to believe that many Republican politicians were doing so simply by the logic of partisan opposition. After all, Republicans had been happy enough to approve of similar things under Republican administrations. Differences between Bushes, Clintons, and Obamas are of degree, not kind. Moreover, 2009-10 establishment Republicans sought only to modify the government’s agenda while showing eagerness to join the Democrats in new grand schemes, if only they were allowed to. Sen. Orrin Hatch continued dreaming of being Ted Kennedy, while Lindsey Graham set aside what is true or false about ""global warming"" for the sake of getting on the right side of history. No prominent Republican challenged the ruling class’s continued claim of superior insight, nor its denigration of the American people as irritable children who must learn their place. The Republican Party did not disparage the ruling class, because most of its officials are or would like to be part of it.

Never has there been so little diversity within America’s upper crust. Always, in America as elsewhere, some people have been wealthier and more powerful than others. But until our own time America’s upper crust was a mixture of people who had gained prominence in a variety of ways, who drew their money and status from different sources and were not predictably of one mind on any given matter. The Boston Brahmins, the New York financiers, the land barons of California, Texas, and Florida, the industrialists of Pittsburgh, the Southern aristocracy, and the hardscrabble politicians who made it big in Chicago or Memphis had little contact with one another. Few had much contact with government, and ""bureaucrat"" was a dirty word for all. So was ""social engineering."" Nor had the schools and universities that formed yesterday’s upper crust imposed a single orthodoxy about the origins of man, about American history, and about how America should be governed. All that has changed.

224675,"Recently by Thomas Sowell: Political Statistics

Someone once said that taxes are the price we pay for civilization. That may have been true when he said it, but today taxes are mostly the price we pay so that politicians can play Santa Claus and get reelected.

That’s not the worst of it. We may think of taxes as just a source of government revenue. But tax rates are a big political statement on the left, whether they bring in any revenue or not.

For more than 80 years, the political left has opposed what they call “tax cuts for the rich.” But big cuts in very high tax rates ended up bringing in more revenue to the government in the Coolidge, Kennedy, Reagan and Bush 43 administrations. This included more — repeat, more — tax revenue from people in the highest income brackets than before.

That was because high-income people took their money out of tax shelters like municipal bonds and invested where they could get a higher rate of return, after these returns were not being taxed as much. This has happened repeatedly, over so many decades, in administrations of both parties, that you might think this would put an end to the “tax cuts for the rich” demagoguery.

But the same rhetoric that “progressives” like Senator Bob La Follette used against tax cuts in the 1920s is still going strong in the 21st century. When you point out to today’s “progressives” that “the rich” paid more total tax revenue to the government after what were called “tax cuts for the rich,” that doesn’t make a dent.

After all, “the rich” paid that larger sum of taxes only because their incomes had risen. Their paying a higher share of all taxes doesn’t matter to the “progressives,” who see high tax rates as a way to take a bigger bite out of the incomes of higher-income people, not just provide more revenue to the government.

Tax rates are meant to make an ideological statement and promote class-warfare politics, not just bring in revenue.

There has been much indignation on the left over the recent news that General Electric paid no taxes, despite its large amounts of profit. But another way of looking at this is that high tax rates on paper do not mean high tax revenues for the government.

The liberal answer to budget deficits is almost always to raise tax rates on “the rich,” in order to bring in more revenue. The fact that higher tax rates have often brought in less revenue than before is simply ignored.

Our corporate tax rates are higher than in many other countries. That may have something to do with the fact that many American corporations (including General Electric) expand their operations in many other countries, providing jobs — and tax revenues — in those other countries.

But high-tax ideologues don’t see it that way. They would be horrified at the idea that we ought to lower our corporate tax rates, just so that more American businesses would do more of their business at home, providing more Americans with much-needed jobs.

To ideologues, that is just a cop-out from the class-warfare battle. It is far more important to them to score their political points against “the rich” or “Wall Street” than that a few million more Americans out of work would be able to find jobs.

The idealism of the left is a very selfish idealism. In their war against “the rich” and big business, they don’t care how much collateral damage there is to workers who end up unemployed.

It so happens that many — if not most — of those called “the rich” are not rich and many, if not most, of those called “the poor” are not poor. They are people who happen to be in a particular part of the income stream as of a given moment in their lives when statistics are collected.

Internal Revenue Service data show that the income of people who were in the lowest income tax bracket in 1996 rose by 91 percent by 2005. But people in the “top one percent” had their incomes drop by 26 percent in those same years.

There is nothing complicated about this. Most people simply start at the bottom when they are young and their pay rises as they get more experience. Most people in the top one percent are there for only a single year when they happen to have a spike in income. They too are not an enduring class.

The time is long overdue to start thinking about taxes as sources of revenue, not as ways of making political statements.

223100,"Mr. O's Fairness Taxes Could Backfire and End Up A Big Zero for America Tax Reforms Appeal to the Envious Masses, Protect Friends of Mr. O and May Backfire To Crash the Economy

by Bill Sardi

Recently by Bill Sardi: Bankers Want Entire Industry To Become One Giant MF Global

In an era when growth in the private sector of the economy has ceased and an unprecedented compensational expansion of the federal deficit budget has been launched in a massive wealth-transfer maneuver, instead of lowering taxes to free up capital to grow the economy, Mr. O appeals to the American masses that the wealthy aren't paying their fair share of taxes.

The widening gap between rich and poor creates believability to the idea the wealthy are a bunch of tax cheats who have helped create an unprecedented decline in the American economy. In fact, the wealthy may be scapegoats who may take a bullet that should be aimed at crony capitalists who own the White House. Truth-be-told — proposed tax increases will likely backfire and lead America over the cliff into a financial morass while the real tax cheats hide behind the Presidential Seal.

I thought the problem was government over-spending but the widening income gap between the very wealthy and poor has been exploited to gain votes for the upcoming election. It's a bait and switch maneuver that is gaining traction in the streets as the slogan about the 99% vs. the 1% has now spread across the globe. In fact, it appears the 99% vs. 1% banner is nothing more than a hidden campaign to restore undeserved confidence in Mr. O and aid his re-election. There are powerful forces in play here, the same forces that were able to award Mr. O a Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, barely a year into his Presidency, at the height of the public's first realization Mr. O was not living up to his campaign promises.

Then Presidential candidate Mr. O faced ABC's Charles Gibson in the 2008 primary debates. Gibson said: ""history shows that when you drop the capital gains tax, the revenues go up."" Obama's reply: ""Well, Charlie, what I've said is that I would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness."" So this fairness theme for taxation has been on Mr. O's mind for some time.

Don't pin the tale on the wrong donkey

In this game of pinning the tale on the donkey, blame has been laid on the super wealthy for the sour state of the American economy. The super wealthy are mischaracterized as tax evaders rather than high income individuals who are simply avoiding taxes by taking all the deductions the tax code provides. And upon examination, the super-wealthy become anyone making $$200,000 or more a year.

Mr. O isn't talking about fairness taxes for his cronies in the banking and investment industry who are plundering the American economy via fast electronic stock trades, insider trading, exorbitant bonuses for government bailed-out financial institutions, government guaranteed stock trading, money laundering, disregard for reserve requirements, side-stepping of accounting rules, overvaluation of real estate, and violation of other existing laws. Mr. O's administration is laced with cabinet members and other White House consultants from the financial industry. If you don't believe Mr. O is buddy-buddy with Wall Street banksters, watch this video.

Instead, Mr. O is aiming at American entrepreneurs like Larry Ellison of Oracle, Bill Gates of Microsoft and Mitt Romney of Bain Capital fame, who derive a great deal of their income in the form of capital gains that aren't taxed at the same rate as normal income. It should be remembered that Mr. O promised when he was running for office in 2008 that he would cut the budget deficit in half by the end of his first term.

Now in 2012 it is the evil millionaires and even quarter-millionaires that are to blame for the sour economy. The change of subject by Mr. O is achieved only because of a news media that doesn't point all this out to the public.

NPR presents Mr. O's fairness taxes:

Here is what NPR has to say about Mr. O's fairness tax plan:

Under current law, the top capital gains rate is scheduled to rise next year from 15 to 20 percent. You’ll hear a lot in the coming months about how this tax increase will destroy jobs. That’s demonstrably untrue. Indeed, we’d like to see capital gains rates rise to the level of income taxes. For one thing, it would prevent the sort of tax-code gaming that occurs when wealthy investors disguise what’s actually income as capital gains, just so they can pay the lower rate. For another, a capital gains tax lower than the regular income tax causes the U.S. Treasury to forego a vast amount of revenue — and, given the budget deficit, that’s something we can ill afford.

But, perhaps most importantly, there’s a basic matter of justice at stake: Why should we tax labor at a higher rate than capital? Why should the wealthy be able to contribute at lower rates than other Americans? These were some of the principles behind a 1986 tax reform bill that taxed capital gains at the same rate as wages. It was signed by a notorious left-winger named Ronald Reagan. It did not cause the sky to fall. And it made America, however temporarily, a fairer place.

Rebuttal to NPR But, but, please NPR, just how does the growth of more federally-backed jobs do anything but put more unemployed people on the backs of the remaining employed? Taxes don't create real jobs, private capital does. The federal government swipes 15% of its revenues just for overhead.

And why, asks NPR, should America tax capital at a lower rate than labor? Answer: because this attracts more investment and growth in the economy. The idea is to keep the wealthy from hoarding wealth and not putting it to use. For example, Mr. Romney, like many retirees, derives a great deal of his income off of capital gains in the form of stock dividends. You can ridicule Romney and make him your poster boy for fairness taxes, but sticking tax pins in a Romney doll would drastically reduce the retirement income of many seniors who wisely invested their money years ago rather than relying solely upon Social Security to see them through their retirement. It is a misdirected idea to raise capital gain tax from 15% to 30%, as Mr. O proposes. His appeal for fairness taxes only polarizes Americans, pitting rich against poor in a convincing vote-getting tactic that preys upon the desperate masses and their financial plight.

There goes the consumer economy

Another proposed fairness tax would be to ditch the Bush tax cuts and raise the tax on top tier wage earners from 35% to 39.6%. This suggestion has gained great traction in the news media but it too will backfire like the rise in capital gains taxes.

With manufacturing and exports having dwindled, 70% of the American economy is now represented by consumer spending. It has become clear that wealthy Americans have continued to go shopping during this economic downturn. Sales of luxury goods are up. American Express beat forecasts in January 2012 largely on higher spending per card by its more affluent customer base. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has said economic recovery depends upon consumer spending, ""the willingness of households to spend,"" he said.

Now, take away that additional 4.6% that top wage earners get to keep (difference between 35% and 39.6% top-tax rate) and the consumer economy is likely to collapse.

It seems like Washington DC is mindless in its quest to dig itself out of deficit spending, risking a backfire that would bring down the whole economy. That the masses are herded into this factitious corral is even more frightening.

Tax hikes appear inevitable regardless of the election

Regardless of who is elected to the White House in the 2012 election it appears that these proposed tax hikes are going into effect. Take a gander at the Congressional Budget Office chart (click here for link) showing annual federal spending is charted to decline from –$$1.079 trillion in 2012 to –$$585 billion in 2013 and -$$269 billion by 2015. That is all accomplished by the proposed tax increases.

Something that is lost in the history of the Bush tax cuts is the fact GW Bush reduced taxes by about $$400 billion, tax cuts that were enacted in 2001 and 2003. Immediately thereafter, sharp rises in gasoline prices followed. Bush was a former oilman. He simply released money that would have come into the federal coffers into the economy so oil producers could raise their prices. But now we have the opposite, with gasoline prices rising rapidly and a major oil producer (Iran) threatening to re-direct its oil to non-western countries. We now have the prospect of $$4-a-gallon gasoline. The proposed tax increases will further diminish the disposable income of Americans.

Peter Ferrara lowers the boom on fairness taxes

Peter Ferrara, writing at Forbes.com, explains the outcome of President O's fairness taxes this way (excerpted):

….Already enacted under current law for 2013 are increases in the top tax rates for virtually every major federal tax. In that year, the tax increases of Obamacare go into effect, and the Bush tax cuts expire, which Obama refuses to renew for the nation's small businesses, job creators and investors. That is the English translation of individuals making over $$200,000 a year, and couples making over $$250,000 per year.

As a result, if the Bush tax cuts simply expire for these higher income earners, the top 2 income tax rates will go up by nearly 20%, the capital gains tax rate will soar by nearly 60%, the tax on dividends will nearly triple, the death tax rate will rise by nearly a third, and the Medicare payroll tax will explode by 62% for these targeted taxpayers.

Obama explains these tax policies in his budget message, saying ""everyone must shoulder their fair share,"" and ""we need an economy where everyone shoulders their fair share to put our fiscal house in order."" The taxpayers targeted for these tax increases are the top 3% of income earners. But as the Wall Street Journal noted Tuesday, those top 3% pay more in federal income taxes than the bottom 97% combined! So if that is not their fair share, what would that fair share be, Mr. Obama?

By contrast, the bottom 40% of income earners as a group paid no federal income taxes. Instead, they received net payments from the income tax system equal to 3.8% of all federal income taxes. In other words, they paid negative 3.8% of federal income taxes.

This was after more than 25 years of supply-side Reaganomics cutting tax rates! The share of federal income taxes paid by the top 1% was 17.6% in 1981, when President Reagan brought his supply side economics to Washington. After a quarter century of rate cuts, that share had more than doubled by 2007, as indicated above. That is because with the lower tax rates, incomes boomed along with the economy, and high income taxpayers had the incentives to pull their money out of tax shelters and invest it in the real economy, fueling the boom while increasing their reported incomes. That is why Jack Kemp always used to say if you want to soak the rich, cut tax rates.

Jack Kemp always used to say if you want to soak the rich, cut tax rates.

President Obama explained in his budget message, ""a teacher, a nurse, or a construction worker who earns $$50,000 a year should not pay taxes at a higher rate than someone making $$50 million. It is wrong for Warren Buffett's secretary to pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett."" Agreed, it would be wrong if it were true. That is why conservative Republicans propose a flat tax, where everyone pays the same rate, and ""everyone plays by the same rules,"" to use the President's words.

In fact, if President Obama's comprehensive tax rate increases are not averted, the result will be revenues falling far short of projections, or even declining further, and deficits and debt increasing even more, rather than declining as Obama wrongly projects.

Ferrara goes on to say that when the capital gains tax rate was cut in 1997 from 28% to 20% that revenues increased by $$84 billion over the pre-tax cut projections for 1997-2000. There are similar examples of this same phenomenon in 1999 and in 2003.

Other rationales for lower capital gains taxes

There are many other rationales for a low capital gains tax:

We should not forget that America is in competition for capital. Germany, Holland, Mexico and India have no capital gains taxes while Canada, China and Japan have tax rates much lower than 30 percent. It's possible a rise in the capital gains tax will drive capital overseas.

There are 21 States that tax capital gains as normal income and at least major State is reevaluating that tax. Tax-free states like Florida beckon investors. Competition for money is keen.

Furthermore, it may be an unpopular fact that many wealthy individuals over-pay capital gains taxes on property they bought years ago and sold years later at a loss or break-even because of offsetting inflation. Currently there is no provision for inflation in capital gains taxes. A lower tax rate on capital gains, which is the current state of affairs, would help offset this problem, says Ray Madoff, writing at Bloomberg News.

The wealthy who own stocks may choose to hold onto their stake in a company for a long time as taxes are not generated until shares are sold. The very wealthy, like Larry Ellison of Oracle fame, can borrow money to purchase yachts and homes using their stock as collateral and pay no tax. So Mr. O wants to enact ""the Buffet rule"" — a new minimum tax of 30% for households earning at least $$1 million a year. But imagine what that minimum 30% tax would do to Mr. Ellison who has pledged 95% of his wealth to charity. The main point here is that the wealthy have many avenues to avoid taxes.

Just exactly how Mr. O pretends to be helping the poor while enriching the wealthy is revealed in an increase in taxpayer-funded subsidies, proposed by the White House, for those who purchase new-technology vehicles, like the Chevrolet Volt. The subsidy would be $$10,000 per buyer for an automobile that sell for $$41,000. The typical Volt buyer has an average annual income of $$175,000.

In summary, Mr. O's fairness taxes may result in a big 0, or even worse, a big minus-zero, for the American economy. If you are wearing a Mr. O T-shirt and you retain it as a keepsake, it might become valuable when Mr. O becomes known as President Zero.

371461,"Divergence between paper gold and physical gold price is happening, the process begun. Actual physical shortages have kept the price up. The naked shorting of futures has kept the paper price down. The fraud cases and lawsuits, with no hint of prosecution, provide the levered force to create much wider divergence, as traders and entire firms depart the tainted crime scene that is the COMEX. Trust has vanished along with private accounts. At the center of the backdrop for the divergence, apart from the criminal events, is the economic deterioration and asset market downdraft. It leads to margin calls, loan payment obligations, fading investor confidence, negative sentiment, and a desire to avoid loss. Hence the huge liquidity concerns, selling of good assets that command a strong price, and central bank encouragement of gold sales even with lease. These forces conspire to push down the gold futures price from the discovery process, called the paper gold price. These forces, although real, are exaggerated by the Syndicate to explain all. On the other side is the desperation among central bankers to cover debt securities up for sale or rollover funding. They resort to utter hyper inflation by monetizing the many types of government bonds. They are obligated to aid their banker cohorts, and thus purchase truckloads of badly impaired sovereign bonds and other collateralized bonds. Over time these sovereign bonds have proved toxic. The compelling need to stimulate economies, to redeem toxic bonds, and to recapitalize and nationalize the big banks adds to the monetary inflation outcome. Therefore, two sides are in opposition in a battle to the death of one or the other. No middle ground can be achieved, not any longer. It is the quintessential battle between monetary hyper inflation and restoring bank system integrity to avert collapse. The insolvency has recently met illiquidity. The battle features strong forces on each side. The divergence between physical and paper gold price is widening.

The incurable speculator junkies committed to the addictive leveraged game rigged by the Forces of Evil seem stuck at the casino tables, where fingers are lost, finally entire hands and arms. If their practice was to purchase physical, they could benefit from the paper price swoon, and join the Forces of Good team, rather than fighting the evil side on their dominated turf. To be sure, many aware analysts in the news maintain a small gold position in COMEX that is rolled over constantly. Many have physical positions but keep with the paper trades as a hobby, better described as an addition to the juice. Leverage cuts both ways. Their continued activity has left them exposed to theft, while knowing the criminality was widespread within the arena. So many players and firms are departing the arena altogether like Ann Barnhardt of BCM Capital. The divergence between physical and paper gold price is widening.

The desperation of the bad team is growing. The gold cartel has benefited significantly from the fresh Libyan gold supply (144 metric tons) and Greek gold supply (111 metric tons), not to mention the ample Dollar Swap Facility. It is the bankers New Gold, as reported by intrepid Jeff Neilson. In a fresh sign of bankster desperation, the lease rates for gold have been pushed down to net negative levels. The fresh supply from the two broken nations has greatly aided the COMEX, providing new cannon fodder. Perhaps more wars to liberate the oppressed can be conjured up, to release more tyrant wealth. It is not a coincidence that negative gold lease rates came when Libyan gold was made available (heisted) and when Italian sovereign bonds went into critical DEFCON mode. The gold supply helped to aid the lack of bond demand. The gold lease story is analyzed more fully in the December Hat Trick Letter.

INELASTICITY BLEMISH

A preface is warranted. The paper Gold market is very different in its internal dynamics from the physical. The paper Gold market shows signs of inelasticity that borders on comical. Witness the low demand in 2001 and 2002 when Gold had a paper price tag at $$300 or less per ounce. Witness nowadays the amplified selling when the paper price declines. The leverage from the corrupted paper mechanisms forces margin pressures and sales. The leveraged game goes opposite to the real world of price mechanisms. On the upside, global demand rises with a rising physical price, called the gold fever. The inelasticity on the supply side is prevalent in the paper market, while the inelasticity on the demand side is prevalent on the physical market. To confuse the mix, mining firms realize some inelasticity as price falls, they are stuck with a liquidity crunch on their forward sales ruin. A huge amount of money is required to cover their losses, urged on by Wall Street advisors. Their mining operations suffer from lack of funds, and projects are curtailed. The paradoxical differences in dynamics help to push the gap between the paper and physical Gold price. The incompatible forces work to rip apart the COMEX. The divergence between physical and paper gold price is widening.

ILLICIT USAGE OF CLIENT FUNDS AS COLLATERAL

The hypothecation battle will bring sufficient publicity to help the divergence along. As more assets are seen as committed, involved, and tainted in the process of grabbing, snatching, and securing collateral, even by illegal means, the physical assets will be removed from the system. Parties will remove accounts and metal from the COMEX in response from basic self-preservation. On the investment and speculation side, harm has been rendered to managed risk. The client funds have begun to flee. The protection and security of money in private accounts has been under siege in recent weeks since the MF Global crime scene was established and the yellow tape cordon has been put in place. Investors are pulling money out of hedge funds at a rapid rate. The COMEX will be increasingly isolated. Clients funds were redeemed to the tune of $$9 billion in October, almost four times as much as they pulled in September, according to Barclay Hedge and TrimTabs Investment Research. Investors in October yanked more from hedge funds, setting a single month high over the last two years.

The redemptions are the largest for the hedge fund industry since July 2009, when $$17.8 billion was returned. The Barclay Hedge office put lipstick on the corrupt pig by commenting on how investors have lost patience with lackluster investor returns. To be sure, the average hedge fund is down by about 4% this year. The global hedge fund industry size has been reduced to $$1.66 trillion, still sizeable. It is always interesting, if not amusing, to read the spin from the isolated corners. Hedge funds are seeing capital depart for the simple reason of moving away from crime centers. In the process the COMEX is being isolated. With increased isolation comes the easily recognized fraud. Look for some major stories soon about the raids to the GLD and SLV inventories by their custodians engaged in naked shorting. The Exchange Traded Fund fraud story is analyzed more fully in the December Hat Trick Letter. The divergence between physical and paper gold price is widening.

DYNAMICS OF PAPER VERSUS PHYSICAL BASIS

Grand divergence dynamics are becoming clear. Ann Barnhardt explained in detail how the COMEX will go away. It will not default, but rather fall into irrelevance. She laid it out in credible detailed form with numerous factors coming to play. The COMEX might still suffer the shame and spotlight of criminal prosecution. It will more certainly suffer from being ignored and shunned. The physical basis market will not respond to the declines in the paper futures market. The current dominant market will go away due to lost integrity and eroded trust. The consequences and implications of the recent major scandal and coverup are enormous, staggering, and sweeping. The changes from the MF Global failure and theft of private segregated accounts will come in time, perhaps accelerated by another similar event to slam the message home. The Syndicate has turned desperate, resorting to theft in the open daylight, which has resulted in direct consequences. Hundreds of COMEX clients waited in line for delivery of gold, and had their wallets stolen by JPMorgan. Their Gold & Silver set for delivery found its way into JPMorgan accounts at the COMEX. The details of the missing silver then reappearing silver is discussed in the December Hat Trick Letter. The slow mentally overlook this fact. The alert who point to fraud consider it a smoking gun. On its face, evidence mounts that JPMorgan simply converted 614k ounces of MF Global client silver into JPM licensed vaults. Big hats off to the Silver Doctors for excellent financial fraud forensic analysis. Do not expect prosecution over the crime, for MF Global, for JPMorgan, or for the accomplices in London, not even Jon Corzine. The Fascist Business Model in the Untied States does not permit prosecution. The bigger the crime, the more likely the perpetrator is in control of the government high offices, the financial ministry, the printing press, or the regulators.

Ann Barnhardt explained how the COMEX will fade away into oblivion. Its final chapter will be marred by a grand price divergence, where the futures market price declines from shunned avoidance, while the cash physical market price holds steady then rises. Many including the Jackass had thought that a slew of delivery demands would force a drain in their gold & silver inventory, eventually leading to a slew of lawsuits, together to shut them down as a corrupt enterprise arena. The MF Global theft reveals the alternative route that seems more clear. The gold cartel led by JPMorgan and secretly by the USFed will not go quietly. They have resorted to theft of private accounts on the open stage. The money is not missing. That is the lie. It is held in JPMorgan accounts in London, where fraud laws are more relaxed. We have seen this Madoff movie before, but it will be shown on the silver screen again. The divergence between physical and paper gold price is widening.

90422,"Eduardo Saverin, the Facebook co-founder immortalized by his falling out with Mark Zuckerberg in the movie The Social Network, has renounced his U.S. citizenship ahead of the companys IPO.

Saverin, 30, may have made the move for tax reasons, hoping to avoid the highest rates before Facebook goes public. Although born and raised in Brazil before moving to the United States in 1992, he now lives abroad in Singapore. According to a spokeswoman, Saverin actually renounced his citizenship last September, but the information didnt become public until Bloomberg reported that the IRS released his name on April 30.

Saverin would not be the first billionaire to renounce citizenship for tax purposes. John Dorrance III, heir to the Campbells soup fortune, cashed out of the family business when he sold his 10.5% stake in 1995-1996. Dorrance renounced his U.S. citizenship and moved to Ireland prior to the sale. John Fredriksen, oil tanker tycoon, jumped ship out of Norway in favor of tax-friendly Cyprus. Brazilian Lily Safra, widow to banker Edmond Safra, ditched Brazil for Monaco.

Other billionaires have left their homeland for non-tax reasons. Bidzina Ivanishvili, who wants to become prime minister of Georgia, renounced both his Russian and French citizenships to curry favor with voters. Ted Arison, deceased father to current billionaires Micky and Shari Arison, left the U.S. for Israel in 1990.

Since his falling out with Zuckerberg, Saverin has sold more than half his Facebook stake and has used some of that money to invest in promising startups. In January 2011, he led an $8 million round of financing in Qwiki, which works to improve the way people experience information online. In March 2011, he led a $6.5 million round in Jumio, whose first product, online payment method Netswipe, uses a webcam as a verification device.

458966,"As one who has studied and written on federal criminal law for the past seven years, I have concluded that the ultimate goal for federal prosecutors is to be able to target anyone and charge him or her with a crime. I hardly am exaggerating, as the following article from Slate demonstrates:

At the federal prosecutor’s office in the Southern District of New York, the staff, over beer and pretzels, used to play a darkly humorous game. Junior and senior prosecutors would sit around, and someone would name a random celebrity — say, Mother Theresa or John Lennon.

It would then be up to the junior prosecutors to figure out a plausible crime for which to indict him or her. The crimes were not usually rape, murder, or other crimes you’d see on Law & Order but rather the incredibly broad yet obscure crimes that populate the U.S. Code like a kind of jurisprudential minefield: Crimes like “false statements” (a felony, up to five years), “obstructing the mails” (five years), or “false pretenses on the high seas” (also five years). The trick and the skill lay in finding the more obscure offenses that fit the character of the celebrity and carried the toughest sentences. The result, however, was inevitable: “prison time.”

Today, they have the weapons to do the preceding with ease, and the weapons are so powerful that I can guarantee that everyone reading this article is a felon. That’s right; you, too, are a criminal and if a federal prosecutor targets you, then you are going to prison.

Constitutional Chaos: ... Andrew P. Napolitano Best Price: $$1.00 Buy New $$1.44 (as of 09:30 EST - Details)

You might not have robbed a bank or stolen anything, or engaged in any of the 10,000 ""crimes"" that federal prosecutors have in their buffet line, but I can guarantee that you are ""guilty"" of ""honest services fraud."" Have you ever taken a longer lunch break than what you are supposed to do? Have you ever made a personal phone call at work or done personal business on your employer’s computer? Have you ever had a contract dispute with an employer or a client? All of those things can be criminalized by an enterprising federal prosecutor.

If you are an attorney and have signed forms even though you have not read every word in them (for example, the standard closing documents for real estate), then you have committed ""honest services fraud."" The list goes on and on, but most likely by now you have the picture: you are guilty even if you never are placed in the dock in federal criminal court.

As one person intimately familiar with these kinds of prosecutions told me, ""This is better than RICO,"" and the RICO statutes have proven to be one of the ultimate weapons used by federal prosecutors. Just the threat of invoking RICO can make even tough defendants turn into pliable putty ready to plead out instead of going to trial. Just ask Michael Vick.

Jeffrey Skilling right now is serving more than 20 years in prison, as the former Enron CEO was convicted of ""honest services fraud."" Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich is under indictment for the ""crime,"" and the feds currently are investigating the archdiocese under Catholic Bishop Roger Mahony to see if they can secure indictments under this statute. From former college basketball coaches to politicians, ""honest services fraud"" has become the ultimate prosecutorial weapon, and prosecutors are quick to declare their support for it. According to the Wall Street Journal:

…prosecutors love it. Patricia Pileggi, a former prosecutor who has brought honest-services fraud cases, says “since you don’t have to prove loss of money, the statute is easier for prosecutors to use” than extortion or bribery statutes.

In fact, this particular law, first passed by Congress as an amendment to a wire and mail-fraud statute in 1988, allows federal prosecutor to do what prosecutors always have dreamed of doing: circumvent Constitutional protections against the accused by both creating what essentially are bills of attainder and ex post facto law. Let me explain.

The Road to Serfdom: T... F. A. Hayek Best Price: $$2.72 Buy New $$6.98 (as of 05:40 EST - Details)

First, and most important, the law itself is vague. According to the statute, Congress has criminalized “a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services,” but how does one define ""honest services""? And who is deprived?

Those questions are answered by prosecutors seeking indictments and convictions, and it is they who decide what is ""criminal"" and what is not. Although the question of guilt ultimately is supposed to be left to a jury, the very presence of such broadly-interpreted criminal laws with draconian penalties of 20 years or more in prison will lead many innocent people to plead out to something because the risk of going to trial is too great. Because federal prosecutors see their job as being a ""hammer"" and they see everyone else as a ""nail,"" it is clear that the loose and vague language in the statute involving an ""intangible right"" to services of others is an open-ended invitation for prosecutors to craft charges around whatever alleged act they wish to criminalize, even if the act itself is legal. This is the very essence of a bill of attainder.

Second, because all-too-often an act is interpreted as being ""criminal"" after the fact, in essence, prosecutors are able to go back to an act that everyone believed to be legal and effectively apply a criminal statute to it. This is the essence of ex post facto law, which is unconstitutional. In a remarkable joint move by two ideologically-opposing groups, the Heritage Foundation and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers wrote in a February 11, 2009, letter to Congress that this law creates ""a charter of authority for courts to decide, retroactively, what forms of unfair or questionable conduct in commercial, public and even private life should be deemed criminal.""

There is another huge problem with this law (if we can dignify it as such by even calling it ""law""): its vagueness and broad interpretation permits federal prosecutors to engage in tyrannical selective prosecution. When a law is so broad that nearly everyone who provides any services has broken it, then prosecutors are able to target people who might be politically unpopular.

For example, despite the fact that Jeffrey Skilling did not break the law by putting some of Enron’s assets in ""special purpose entities,"" which were included in the company’s financial statements, nonetheless prosecutors were able to convince jurors that his actions were criminally fraudulent. Although Victoria Sprouse was not charged with ""honest services fraud"" when she recently was railroaded in federal court, nonetheless federal prosecutor Matt Martens told the jury that because she had admitted to not reading every word in every by-the-numbers legal document she signed, she had committed ""honest services fraud.""

Now, if someone like Martens wanted to launch prosecutions against professional people for not reading documents they sign, why is he not bringing criminal charges against members of Congress, who rarely read bills that either they approve or vote down? For example, John Conyers, D-Michigan, recently caused a stir when he admitted that he did not read bills before him. So, here is a lawmaker openly admitting that he does not read legislation, and he hardly is alone. (Few, if any, members of Congress read the Patriot Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act before approving them overwhelmingly.)

There is no substantive difference between what Martens deemed as ""fraud"" with Victoria Sprouse and what the nation’s elected representatives do every day they are in session. In fact, one could argue that at least Sprouse knew the substance of the documents before she signed; many senators and representatives cannot tell their constituents the content of the legislation before them. Yet, Sprouse is going to prison and members of Congress do not have to worry about prosecution (at least for violating that statute).

Journalist Gary S. Chafetz recently wrote about ""honest services fraud,"" pointing out that even the language of the law itself is a fraud:

One of the cardinal rules of a grade-school vocabulary test is this: the word that the student must define cannot be used in its definition. However, honest-services fraud — “a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services” — is a term that no one seems able to define without using “honest-services” in its definition. Which a priori implies that because it cannot be defined, it is unconstitutionally vague.

This horrible law is 20 years old and only now is the U.S. Supreme Court even beginning to look seriously at it. The court has agreed to hear the appeal of recently-convicted media figure Conrad Black who is in prison after a federal jury convicted him of ""honest services fraud."" Unfortunately, I doubt the High Court will do anything to upset federal prosecutors, who pretty much own the federal ""justice"" (sic) system, lock, stock and barrel.

503103,"“In many parts of the country, teachers are viewed as beyond reproach, much like doctors, police officers, or clergy … and, therefore, are rarely challenged about their classroom conduct. In some cases, this means that actions that would be considered criminal if committed by a parent remain unchallenged by law enforcement if they occur in a school setting.”—Senator Tom Harkin, “Dangerous Use of Seclusion and Restraints in Schools Remains Widespread and Difficult to Remedy: A Review of Ten Cases”

Roughly 1500 kids are tied up or locked down every day by school officials in the United States.

At least 500 students are locked up in some form of solitary confinement every day, whether it be a padded room, a closet or a duffel bag. In many cases, parents are rarely notified when such methods are used.

On any given day when school is in session, kids who “act up” in class are pinned facedown on the floor, locked in dark closets, tied up with straps, bungee cords and duct tape, handcuffed, leg shackled, tasered or otherwise restrained, immobilized or placed in solitary confinement in order to bring them under “control.”

In almost every case, these undeniably harsh methods are used to punish kids for simply failing to follow directions or throwing tantrums. Very rarely do the kids pose any credible danger to themselves or others. A Government of Wolves... John W. Whitehead Best Price: $$4.00 Buy New $$6.59 (as of 09:35 EST - Details)

Unbelievably, these tactics are all legal, at least when employed by school officials or school resource officers (a.k.a. police officers) in the nation’s public schools.

For example, in what may be the youngest example of a child being restrained in this way, in October 2014, a 4-year-old Virginia preschooler was handcuffed, leg shackled and transported to the sheriff’s office after reportedly throwing blocks and climbing on top of the furniture. School officials claim the restraints were necessary to protect the adults from injury.

In New York, “school safety agents” tied a 5-year-old ADHD student to a chair with Velcro straps as a punishment for throwing a tantrum in class. Police officers claim the straps were necessary because the boy had tried to bite one of the adults.

A 6-year-old kindergarten student in a Georgia public school was handcuffed, transported to the police station, and charged with simple battery of a schoolteacher and criminal damage to property for throwing a temper tantrum at school.

A second-grader in Arizona who suffers from ADHD was duct-taped to her chair after getting up to sharpen her pencil too often.

Kentucky school officials placed a 9-year-old autistic student in a duffel bag as a punishment acting up in class. Turns out, it wasn’t the first time the boy had been placed inside the “therapy bag.”

An 11-year-old special needs student had his hands cuffed behind his back and was driven home in a police car after refusing to come inside after recess and acting in an out of control manner by “passively” resisting police officers.

Unfortunately, these are far from isolated incidents.

According to a ProPublica investigative report, such harsh punishments are part of a widespread phenomenon plaguing school districts across the country.

Indeed, as investigative reporter Heather Vogell points out, this is a local story everywhere. It’s happening in my town. It’s happening in your town. It’s happening in every school district in America.

In 2012 alone, there were more than 267,000 attempts by school officials to restrain or lock up students using straps, bungee cords, and duct tape. The numbers are likely far greater when one accounts for the schools that underreport their use of such tactics.

Vogell found that “most [incidents] of restraints and seclusions happen to kids with disabilities—and are more likely to happen to kids with autism or emotional/behavioral problems.” Often due to their age, their emotional distress, or their disabilities, these young people are unable to tell their parents about the abusive treatment being meted out to them by school officials.

At least 500 students are placed in “Scream Rooms” every day (there were 104,000 reported uses of scream rooms in a given year). For those unfamiliar with the term, a “scream room” is an isolated, unmonitored, locked room—sometimes padded, often as small as four-feet-by-four-feet—which school officials use to place students in seclusion.

These scream rooms are a far cry from the tested and approved “time out,” which involves monitoring the child in a non-locked setting in order to calm him down. As psychiatrist Keith Albow points out, “Scream rooms are nothing but solitary confinement, and by extension, that makes every school that uses them a prison. They turn principals into wardens and make every student an inmate.”

Schools acting like prisons. School officials acting like wardens. Students treated like inmates and punished like hardened criminals.

This is the end product of all those so-called school “safety” policies, which run the gamut from zero tolerance policies that punish all infractions harshly to surveillance cameras, metal detectors, random searches, drug-sniffing dogs, school-wide lockdowns, active-shooter drills and militarized police officers.

Paradoxically, instead of making the schools safer, school officials have succeeded in creating an environment in which children are so traumatized that they suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, nightmares, anxiety, mistrust of adults in authority, as well as feelings of anger, depression, humiliation, despair and delusion.

Even in the face of parental outrage, lawsuits, legislative reforms, investigative reports and endless cases showing that these tactics are not working and “should never be used for punishment or discipline,” full-grown adults—police officers and teachers alike—insist that the reason they continue to handcuff, lock up and restrain little kids is because they fear for their safety and the safety of others.

“Fear for one’s safety” has become such a hackneyed and threadbare excuse for behavior that is inexcusable. Dig a little deeper and you’ll find that explanation covers a multitude of sins, whether it’s poorly trained police officers who shoot first and ask questions later, or school officials who are ill-equipped to deal with children who act like children, meaning they don’t always listen, they sometimes throw tantrums, and they have a hard time sitting still.

That’s not to say all schools are bad. In fact, there are a small but growing number of schools that are proactively switching to a policy of Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS), which relies on the use of “engaging instruction, combined with acknowledgement or feedback of positive student behavior,” in order to reduce the need for unnecessary discipline and promote a climate of greater productivity, safety, and learning. One school in Pennsylvania for children with significant behavior challenges found that they were able to “reduce the use of physical restraint from approximately 1,000 incidents per year in 1998 to only three incidents total in 2012” after switching to a PBIS-oriented program. If exposed to this positive reinforcement early enough in school, by the time a student makes it to the third grade, little to no intervention is required.

Unfortunately, these schools are still in the minority in an age that values efficiency, expediency and conformity, where it’s often faster and easier to “lock down” a kid who won’t sit still, won’t follow orders, and won’t comply.

Certainly, this is a mindset we see all too often in the American police state.

So what’s the answer, not only for the here-and-now—the children growing up in these quasi-prisons—but for the future of this country? How do you convince a child who has been routinely handcuffed, shackled, tied down, locked up, and immobilized by government officials—all before he reaches the age of adulthood—that he has any rights at all, let alone the right to challenge wrongdoing, resist oppression and defend himself against injustice?

Most of all, as I point out in my book A Government of Wolves: The Emerging American Police State, how do you persuade a fellow American that the government works for him when for most of his young life, he has been incarcerated in an institution that teaches young people to be obedient and compliant citizens who don’t talk back, don’t question and don’t challenge authority?

Peter Gray, a professor of psychology at Boston College, believes that school is a prison that is damaging our kids, and it’s hard to disagree, especially with the numbers of police officers being assigned to schools on the rise. What this means, notes Mother Jones, is greater police “involvement in routine discipline matters that principals and parents used to address without involvement from law enforcement officers.”

Students, in turn, are not only finding themselves subjected to police tactics such as handcuffs, leg shackles, tasers and excessive force for “acting up” but are also being ticketed, fined and sent to court for behavior perceived as defiant, disruptive or disorderly such as spraying perfume and writing on a desk.

Clearly, the pathology that characterizes the American police state has passed down to the schools. Now in addition to the government and its agents viewing the citizenry as suspects to be probed, poked, pinched, tasered, searched, seized, stripped and generally manhandled, all with the general blessing of the court, our children in the public schools are also fair game.

What can be done?

Without a doubt, change is needed, but that will mean taking on the teachers’ unions, the school unions, the educators’ associations, and the police unions, not to mention the politicians dependent on their votes and all of the corporations that profit mightily from an industrial school complex.

As we’ve seen with other issues, any significant reforms will have to start locally and trickle upwards. For a start, parents need to be vocal, visible and organized and demand that school officials 1) adopt a policy of positive reinforcement in dealing with behavior issues; 2) minimize the presence in the schools of police officers and cease involving them in student discipline; and 3) insist that all behavioral issues be addressed first and foremost with a child’s parents, before any other disciplinary tactics are attempted.

“Children are the messages we send to a time we will not see,” Professor Neil Postman once wrote. If we do not rein in the police state’s influence in the schools, the future to which we are sending our children will be characterized by a brutal, totalitarian regime.

by Andrew P. Napolitano

Recently by Andrew P. Napolitano: The President's Private War

The trial of the alleged masterminds of 9/11, which began last week at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, will address some of the most profound issues of our era. Are natural rights truly inalienable, as Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence, or can the government take them away from those it hates or fears? Does the Constitution protect the rights of all persons who come in contact with the government, or does it protect only certain Americans, as the government argues? Can the government deny a person due process by changing the rules retroactively, or is the Constitution’s guarantee of due process to all persons truly a guarantee?

These are all questions that the government does not want to answer. But it should know better, because by structuring the trial after the crime was committed and by establishing retroactive rules — which are prohibited by the Constitution — that have never before been used in any American civilian or military court, Congress has created and the Obama administration will conduct a trial that will resemble none in our history.

The trial is being held in Cuba because President Obama caved to political pressure from New York City politicians who did not want the trial at the location where the murders took place. In one of the few rules of criminal procedure laid down in the Constitution itself, the Framers required all trials to be held in the same judicial district where the alleged crime took place. They were familiar with the British practice of trying colonists in London for alleged crimes committed in New York. But today New York politicians and their allies in Congress and the president think they can pick and choose which parts of the Constitution to uphold and which parts they can ignore.

The Constitution guarantees the right to confront evidence and witnesses. The colonists were all too familiar with Star Chamber, a British trial system in which evidence against an accused was summarized by a clerk of the court, rather than presented by witnesses with personal knowledge or revealed in documents for all to see. In trials at Gitmo, the government may summarize evidence for the court, and it may keep documents it plans to use away from the defendants.

The rules for this trial also permit hearsay: basically, anonymous accusations that were also the hallmark of Star Chamber. They permit the Secretary of Defense, who is the boss of both the prosecutors and the judge, to replace the judge if the secretary is displeased by his rulings. This is a procedure that is taken right out of the Communist Party playbook in Stalinist Russia.

Perhaps the most radical departure from American due process and pronounced return to Star Chamber is the congressional authorization for the admission of evidence obtained under torture. There is no question that these defendants were tortured. The CIA has admitted publicly that it waterboarded one of them 183 times and then destroyed the videotapes of the torture so jurors could not see how horrific this procedure is.

Torture is so abhorrent to American values that its use by rogue cops has resulted in what is known as the “shocks the conscience of the court” rule. This principle, which has been in place since colonial times, permits the court to dismiss the charges — no matter how grave — when the government’s behavior shocks the conscience of the court. And all intentional torture is in that category.

I understand the emotions that are fueling these prosecutions, and I understand the pain and loss suffered by those whose loved ones were murdered on 9/11, and I understand the horrific nature of the crimes for which these defendants have been charged. But in America, we still have the rule of law. And that means that no one is above the law and no one is beneath it. Everyone is subject to the law, and the government may not exclude anyone from its protections. That is the essence of our system of justice. It is mandated by the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, and its preservation is the reason we have fought our just wars.

This trial may have dire unforeseen consequences. From the president who opposed all this when he was a senator but now effectuates it, to members of Congress who enacted the Military Commissions Act that authorizes incarceration after acquittal (a procedure even the Soviets did not utilize), to the victims’ families who surely would not want this rough justice visited upon their children; all these people now crying for blood could one day see the ruination of due process in America, with this case as precedent.

What constitutes a fair trial is the due process of American justice, which is guaranteed and required by the Constitution itself. If we deviate from the moral values of that system for the people we hate, woe to us for making law retroactively and based on hatred.

Arrogance and RampantHypocrisy!





In my opinion,

government is at best, tolerated because there is no other recognizable

option available at the time. At worst, it is an evil and tyrannical

overlord of the individual, never ceasing in its desire for power,

money, total control, brutality, war, and imperialism. This opinion

obviously does not serve as a recommendation for any governing system,

with the one exception of peaceful anarchy, or a society without

the State.

Government

is always an instrument of force, as government has nothing, creates

nothing, and produces nothing; it only steals from those who do.

Therefore, politically based government should be avoided at all

cost. Unfortunately, this has rarely happened in history.

Although government

is controlling and brutal in its efforts to remain in power, it

can only retain that power over the rest of society given that the

majority consents to be ruled. In many instances, this consent is

simply implied.

In order to

gain the consent or implied consent of the people, the state uses

many strategies that are steeped in lies and deceit. Government's

most important and necessary strategy for retaining control is fear.

Fear mongering therefore, is a constant weapon in the arsenal of

the state. For if the people were not afraid, they would have little

use for government's continuous assault on their liberty. Fear is

a most powerful driver of emotions, and the illusion of safety a

most coveted prize of the sheep. Rulers, whether elected or not,

fully understand the importance of using fear tactics and the illusion

of safety as weapons against the people. The desired effect is to

at once purposely intimidate the population at large, while allowing

for a state manufactured rescue. The result is an acceptance by

the citizenry of less freedom for an imagined safety.

To achieve

these ends, the state has to create false enemies. In order for

this strategy to be successful, one individual has to be pitted

against another; one group against another group; one nation against

another nation, and so the deception goes. This strategy is nothing

new, but it has been forever effective. It is the strategy of divide

and conquer, derived from the Latin saying, Divide et impera,

which may refer also to divide and rule.

This divisive

agenda takes on many faces, and planned divisiveness and dissension

is found virtually everywhere, this due to the stirring of the pot

by political agitators. Consider white versus black, heterosexual

versus homosexual, Christian versus Islam, men versus women, rich

versus poor, and Republicans versus Democrats. Consider Wall Street

versus Main Street, citizen versus immigrant, and the U.S. nation

state versus the Middle East. As George W. Bush said after the 9/11

attacks, a statement meant to divide if ever one was uttered, ""Either

you are with us or you are with the terrorists.""

Most are aware

of this great divide in our country, but most don't understand that

much of it came about by design. Division leads to separation. Separation

leads to weakness. Weakness leads to serfdom, which of course is

slavery!

Those who seek

to rule understand this concept very well, and use it in order to

gain more power. Those in power control the mainstream media, and

that media is a willing accomplice in the spread of hate. John C.

Danforth once said:

The loudest

voices we hear are those who advocate conflict, divisiveness.

This is a true

statement, and it should serve to alert all to the fact that those

who scream the most, those who spread fear, and those who would

seek a platform to pit one against another, are nothing more than

wolves in sheep's clothing. The U.S. government is just such a wolf,

and constantly seeks to spread fear and hate among us.

It is government

that should stand in fear of the people. Government is afraid of

an educated and intelligent populace. Government is threatened greatly

by self-responsibility and self-reliance. Government becomes impotent

in the presence of peace. Government cowers when confronted by a

unified people. Government loses control when the people know the

truth.

But this government

is not afraid. It is not impotent. It does not cower. It has not

lost control of its power. It is a monster!

So long as

""we the people"" continue to accept the government's plan

for us, so long as the hate continues, so long as most continue

to live in fear, so long as unholy war continues unabated, and so

long as Americans hide from the truth, our future will be predestined.

If we do not alter that now probable destiny, only a life of lost

hope will remain!

Government

is in the last resort the employment of armed men, of policemen,

gendarmes, soldiers, prison guards, and hangmen. The essential feature

of government is the enforcement of its decrees by beating, killing,

and imprisoning. Those who are asking for more government interference

are asking ultimately for more compulsion and less freedom.

215109,"Halliburton apparently does now, as this report from the Houston Chronicle indicates. And to answer the important question, no, Dubai doesn’t. Extradite everyone we ask for, that is.

Perhaps Dubai will extradite Halliburton executives in the future, and Halliburton accountants and administrators and operators, too. We will surely need their testimony, and their bad selves, for all those future criminal charges here in the United States. Maybe Dubai will, maybe Dubai won’t.

If I were Halliburton’s CEO Dave Lesar, with less than two years left in a Cheney administration, I’d move all the junk in my trunk to Dubai, and quick. Time is money. And there could be a lot of time served given the way Halliburton has ""earned"" their government paycheck over the past six years.

This isn’t about the latest top felon in Washington, Irving ""Scooter"" Libby, although I can’t avoid seeing some link between his important but mild conviction to the Halliburton move. After all, the Libby trial has been ongoing for some time. As it turns out, regular people really can follow a confusing rabbit trail, and fairly and justly convict a nice-looking, well-mannered guy called Scooter. I predict après Scooter, le deluge for the less likable members of this corrupt administration, and their BFFs.

It is certainly gratifying to see Scooter convicted by a jury of his peers for lying to law enforcement officials. It is extremely disgusting, and unfortunately typical, if one believes former Nixon counsel John Dean (and I do), to see a guy lie to protect the people to which he owes his career.

It is also perturbing and frightening to understand Scooter Libby, a lying, felonious ""public servant,"" is nearly guaranteed a pardon, and probably a George W. Bush Presidential Freedom Medal to boot. Libby was a good soldier in the public fraud leading to a war of choice waged by the biggest and best military in the world against one of the weakest and least capable for no legal or honest reason. Libby helped foment the destruction of Iraq, something he believed in and wanted desperately, a destruction that proceeded apace, and was successful beyond any neoconservatives’ wildest dreams.

Some neoconservatives dreamed of a new, larger and awe-inspiring military presence in the heart of the region, able to act in immediate response to actions against Israel (or our own inconveniently placed forces) by any of the ""unholy seven"" — that list of seven countries the Bush-Cheney administration would ""take out"" in five years. Others, including many military leaders, dreamed of grand massive new bases, and untrammeled air, land and naval training areas in the western and southern deserts of the former country of Iraq. Still others, including many large government-connected corporations, like Halliburton, dreamed of U.S. government approved, arranged, and facilitated contracts (with U.S. military security 24/7, no charge) while doing a booming business repairing and operating the potentially productive oil fields of Iraq, and of other parts of the region.

The dreams all came true, unless you were an Iraqi, or an American soldier or Marine, or perhaps a parent or brother or sister, or spouse or child of someone who gave mobility, sanity or life for the Bush-Cheney project in Iraq. The deals, the bases and the contracts are nothing new. Just a little something — something patriotic Americans back home can think of as a ""freedom discount."" Others call it imperialism, still others corporate capitalism on a global scale. Some simply call it immoral, illegal, and criminal.

Imperialism is illegal by any count, because it is force, and theft, and murder, because it is unjust and hateful and contemptuous. Because it is greedy and ugly, its purveyors and its spawn fare poorly in courts of law.

In an age where most Americans today understand exactly what as been done in their name by the current occupant of the White House, charges will flow slowly at first, and then flood the dockets. Convictions will follow. The Libby jury, as hand-picked as any jury where the defense is highly paid and the defendant establishment-borne, concluded that Libby lied. Why he lied, they don’t know for sure. But I’d bet many on the jury have some good ideas of what the whole thing was about.

Halliburton is correct to jump ship to Dubai, a place proud of its independence and freedom of trade, as well as money laundering capacities. The UAE aspires to be the Switzerland of the region, and perhaps replace Switzerland entirely in an age where it is oil, weapons, and drugs, not gold, that constrain, or fail to constrain, the paper dollar.

It will cost Halliburton a small amount of money and a lot of bad press to move their headquarters to Dubai. This move may indicate less a fear of prosecution and tax liability at home than a sincere desire to participate in an unhampered marketplace, or even a belief (well-justified) that just as Jay Garner stated in early 2004, we are in Iraq militarily for 20 to 30 years, the long haul, with primo military bases no matter who is elected the next American president.

In the George W. Bush lexicon, ""Freedom isn’t free."" And freedom for Halliburton will cost dearly, but the price must be paid. So Dubai it is.

In his second inaugural address only a few years ago, curious George asked this question: ""Did our generation advance the cause of freedom? And did our character bring credit to that cause?""

The jury is still out on the first question, if only because George W. Bush and Dick Cheney are inadvertently creating new libertarians at an unprecedented rate. However, the mainstream media’s breathless reporting from Washington and Houston confirms the answer to the second.

374822,"The Duke, Congressman Randy Cunningham, is America’s self-proclaimed Super Hero and Super Patriot. A real Top Gun Navy pilot and decorated Vietnam Ace, he boasted endlessly about being the “Model” for Tom Cruise’s Super Hero in “Top Gun.”

Like all of America’s Super Patriots, jingoistic war-mongers and creators of foreign Demons for those filled with blood lust to attack and murder, The Duke is a very ignorant man who knows little about human or American history and far less about other cultures and civilizations around the world he wants to “Liberate” by annihilating and ruling them. He represents the district just north of where we live on the coast in La Jolla, California. I have endured his self-proclamations of wisdom and superiority for years in the local and national Big Media, which were lavish in their coverage and boosterism for his ignorant and preposterous blasts.

There is nothing personal in my loathing for what he represents in America. I assiduously avoid any personal contact or interest in these self-proclaimed Christian warmongers and annihilators of nations and war criminals, since I know such bigots are totally closed to any facts or reasoned discussions against their global imperialism wrapped in the shining armor of totally deceitful claims of Freedom and Liberation and Democracy. I must have argued with thousands of these Worst and Dumbest over fifty years and finally gave up.

Personally, the fallen Duke is an object of pity. His tearful confession for the judge and tv cameras that he has betrayed his country, his family, his friends, and his constituents (but not his God?) is obviously a ploy to get a reduced sentence at Club Fed once he rats out his vast web of co-conspirators in plea bargaining, but it also touches that chord of pity in us. I would gladly forgive him and grant him total pardon, if he would tell the American people in simple, heart-felt honesty how his Republicrat Party has betrayed the Constitution, the American nation, mankind and God in their lust for power, vanity, blood, conquest, and wealth.

The Super Patriot Duke made a major contribution to all of this Total Corruption at the Top of America that is now destroying the heart of America  the love of Freedom  and the soul of the Constitution  the laws against all big government and other concentrations of power that constitute in themselves the destruction of freedom. But he is a small time player, a mere supporting actor for Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Powell, Rice, Clinton, DeLay, Kerry, and all the top leaders of the Republicrat Gang of Thousands. He will now be abandoned and trashed by all of them not in danger of immediate indictment and imprisonment from his anguished plea bargaining, as they beat their Breastplate of Righteousness to “prove” to the uneducated and totally paid off rich that they are not part of that cesspool of corruption.

The Duke is their Super Patriot wingman. He has always done their bidding. He represents them and all the rottenness and filth and slime and sleaze in this New America of immense secret police armies and imperial conquests and mass murders and war crimes and tortures around the globe.

It is what he represents and supports slavishly, the Totally Corrupt Republicrat System, that I loathe, not this pitiful shell of a Top Gun for the Party. He succumbed to all the immense temptations of that System they have built over the past century and was swept away by hubris into vast crimes and self-betrayals in the same way all of us would be if we were transformed as he was from a real person into a Super Hero of The System.

As you watch the Duke and his army of co-conspirators weeping in shame at having been caught, remember that these were once decent, real human beings inspired by human and Godly values who were swept away to become the worst and dumbest in our nation and destroyed by the Republicrat System in the same way you or I would be. No one can or ever has resisted those godlike powers. Tremble at the recognition of the fact that The Duke represents and is what everyone at the top of that vast pyramid of power has become. And feel the dread that is now gripping mankind as the Super Power sinks into this ghastly vortex of corruptions that threatens the world.

369791,"Most Reverend Thomas Olmstead Bishop of Phoenix 400 East Monroe Street Phoenix, AZ 85004-2336

Subject: On the Proper Defense of Marriage: An Open Letter to the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix

Most Reverend Olmstead,

I write to you as a humble lay parishioner and sinner, worshiping in the Diocese of Phoenix. Like all American Catholics today, I am concerned with the present state of marriage in this country. Recently, the USCCB issued a letter urging the US Senate to support the now failed federal marriage amendment. The failure of this constitutional amendment should be seen as a blessing and it is my humble opinion that supporting such an amendment in the future would be a grave strategic error in defense of the true institution of marriage. I hope to demonstrate that such an amendment would become a significant threat to the sacramental nature of Catholic marriage as well as to the magisterial authority of the Church in the United States.

First let us examine the impetus for such a constitutional amendment on marriage. It is certainly understandable why many Catholics and our separated Christian brethren would push for such an amendment, particularly with the recent aberrations that have taken place in San Francisco and Massachusetts. In the United States marriage is suffering from the multitude of non-marital living arrangements, from a lack of understanding and therefore commitment to sexual ethics, from an epidemic of divorce, and from the current homosexual aberration. These developments should shock all Christians and cause them to take action against such monstrosities.

Surrounded by all these negative developments, some Catholics and Christians hope that the force of secular law can help protect and save the marital institution by shielding marriage from societal vices. Past and current vice laws were enacted to combat some of these problems. There have been state laws against unmarried couples living together; despite these laws many do. Prostitution and proposed pornography laws seek to assist the marriage commitment, but yet they would still plague an immoral society. Sodomy laws seek to curb immoral sexual actions, yet many practice it. All these laws seek to forcibly remove these immoral actions from our presence, yet they remain. These secular laws are really intended for the hardness of man’s heart. A hardness that grows ever harder in absence of the Real Presence.

Are these laws and federal amendments going to save or support the sacrament of marriage? We know as Catholics that it is only through the true exercise of Christian discipleship that the marital vocation is saved. The ultimate marital regulators for Catholics should be the sacraments of Eucharist combined with Reconciliation in light of the Gospel. Of course a proper understanding of the Eucharist’s Real Presence among Catholics is imperative in this regulation. Without proper knowledge of the Real Presence, a man’s heart will grow harder and seek other less desirable coercive ways to regulate his behavior. It is only through Christ that homosexuality, sodomy, pornography, and prostitution can be effectively eliminated from the heart. It is only through Christ that we can have meaningful and self-actualizing marriages. A federal marriage amendment will do no such thing.

There will be something that a federal marriage amendment will do in this country. It will set up a federal agency to regulate marriage. It is important to note that every positive assertion or regulation in the Constitution has an agency or office associated with it. The only clauses that don’t have offices associated with it are the Bill of Rights, which seeks to protect the people from the government. The marriage amendment positively asserts that the only legal union to be conferred is that of a man and a woman. With such a positive assertion there will come a marriage Czar and another office of federal bureaucracy. Be warned that such a Czar will be a threat to the Catholic Church and its proper authority over Catholic marriage in the United States. The Federal government has already found sneaky ways of regulating Church associated organizations through the granting of government funds and other laws. As I’m sure you know well that the California Supreme Court has recently mandated that the Diocese of Sacramento’s Catholic Charities provide insurance coverage for contraception. This example is just the infancy of threats the current nature of the American secular state is capable of producing and it should be a warning sign to American Bishops. Give a marriage czar some time and you will see mandates for a government type pre-cana for all marriages complete with un-natural family planning and lessons on abortion.

Catholics should not forget their history and look back to at the initial reasons for many modern secular institutions in this country. Woman’s suffrage, the temperance movement (Prohibition Amendment), public education, immigration restriction, abortion and contraception were all secular instruments initially used with the intent to undermine the Catholic Church in the US.1 So why should Catholics put faith in mechanisms that that have been used to undermine the sacred Church? Why put faith in a few miniscule political victories when they can detrimentally hurt the Church?

Let us not put faith in secular laws. It is God’s dominion that we seek and it is through the temporal structures of His Church that the marital sacrament can be best defended. Currently the Church is doing some good things in the defense of marriage with its pre-cana programs and writings like John Paul II’s Theology of the Body.

Despite the positive aspects of the Church’s protection of marriage, there is something subtle that the American Church is allowing to happen before it recognizes a sacramental marriage. It is that of a civil marriage granted through licensure by the state. Now one may not think that going to the state for a marriage license has much affect on the institution of marriage, but an examination into such licensure would show just how profound the affect is. The current regime in the American States goes as follows:

State: Come to me first when marrying. You need our license first.

Church: After a solid pre-cana, come to us with your license and we will confer a sacrament.

State: Come to me when trouble comes. Divorce is just a few documents away. Go to your attorney. Go to the divorce store.

Church: Come to us after your civil divorce and we may find cause for a proper annulment. Some will not look for an annulment and just drop out of Church life.

When a couple goes through hard times together, as almost all invariably do, it is much easier to seek the advice of legal counsel and hammer out a divorce. The adversarial nature of secular courts nicely suits spouses who have reached the unfortunate relationship of adversaries. Many say why go to the Church, when their recommendations are ""unrealistic."" ""They don’t understand my needs,"" will exclaim many. Even as Catholics, many of us are easily tempted to take on the role as adversary because it is so easy to go through some lawyers and the state. Often these paid representatives have in mind the selfish and uncharitable needs of adversarial spouses, unlike that of the Church. Unfortunately in the hearts of most, the Church plays second fiddle to legal and cultural institutions that suit their ""needs."" This situation is subtle and not easily seen, but of utmost importance.

In this subtle situation, the state is always trying to seek recognition prior to the Church and God’s dominion. In fact, it’s a safe but troubling bet that most Christian children in the US receive their social security number before they are even Baptized. Granted, we are called by the Church to submit to legitimate authorities and serve for the common good of society. However, the Church also states:

The citizen is obliged in conscience not to follow the directives of civil authorities when they are contrary to the demands of the moral order, to the fundamental rights of persons or the teachings of the Gospel. Refusing obedience to the civil authorities, when their demands are contrary to those of an upright conscience, finds its justification in the distinction between serving God and serving the political community. ""Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s."" We must obey God rather than men… [Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2239]

So then is it right that we as Catholics should refuse obedience to the civil authority in the case of a marriage license, and is such a license a homage that we must render to Caesar? The answer must be an emphatic yes to the former and no to the latter, because the implication of all state marriage licenses is the right to terminate the contract in the secular court for reasons even as frivolous as ""irreconcilable differences."" With such an implication of divorce are couples truly entering the vocation freely and without mental reservation? Marriage under the Church offers no such implication, but American Catholics become easily confused with a state license in their hands. These state licenses should be looked at by the Church as an unlawful license to divorce, not marry. It is a tool which works contrary to the upright conscience and confuses many into following the civil authority rather than God’s law and the Gospel in light of Mat 5:31—32.

Further the empirical evidence on divorce in the United States supports an argument for Catholic civil disobedience on marriage. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, they explain divorce among the general American population from 1870 to 1905:

The rate per 100,000 married population was 81 in the year 1870 and 200 in the year 1900… Divorce rates appear to be much higher in the United States than in any of the foreign countries for which statistics relating to this subject have been obtained [emphasis mine].

Among the US population, divorce has been recently cited as the termination of greater than 50% of all marriages. For American Catholics, it has been cited as greater than 30%. Consistently through the years, the US seems to have a greater instance of civil divorce than most other countries.

Therefore, in light of the fact that divorce is implied by a secular marriage license and the subsequently numerous cases of divorce, American secular institutions cannot be trusted as a desirable means in a Catholic defense of marriage.

Besides, why let US secular institutions have authority over the Catholic sacrament of marriage, when no other sacrament is regulated by secular institutions? Right now, one does not need a license to Baptism, Reconciliation, Eucharist, Confirmation, Holy Orders, or Anointing of the Sick, as there never should be. Nor should there be a license for the Sacrament of Marriage.

There are effective positive alternatives that the Church can pursue to defend marriage from the confusion caused by the state’s imposition of a marriage license.

The Catholic Church in America would be wise to not allow for the licensure of any civil marriage of Catholics in the future. All matters of marriage for Catholics would be best dealt with solely by the recipients of the Sacrament and the Church. Prior to marriage, the Church would ask those seeking the Sacrament to not seek the adversarial position of the secular court unless the Church has deemed the marriage to be properly annulled or when the civil rights of an individual spouse or family member have been violated (rape, assault, murder, etc.). In the case of annulment, an adversarial position could be then taken by annulled spouses for dealings with property issues, but not for the granting of a divorce of an unlicensed Catholic sacrament. In the case of violated civil rights the spouse should still not seek civil divorce and deal solely with the Church on annulment.

As for current Catholic holders of such a license, they should leave it as is, and be asked to treat their marriages in the discipline mentioned above. The only difference is that that American Catholics should seek to have their civil license divorced only after the Church deems the marriage as properly annulled.

The advantage of this proposal would be greater discipline over the sacrament of Marriage by the Church than there currently is. There would be no cause for confusion among married parishioners about divorce and the Church will be seen as the primary and sole arbitrator of Catholic marriages. Marriage will lie within the realm of the Church and there would be no concerns over loss of ecclesiastical authority, thus decreasing the likelihood of heresy entering It.

Subsequent to such enactments, the Church will see great spiritual benefits. The Church will see greater reflection on marriage as a call by the Triune God to a true Christian vocation, rather than something one feels like doing for their own sake. This will lead to fewer annulments as parishioners find a proper response to their true callings. Greater reflection will lead others to see their true call to a religious life either through Holy Orders or other religious vocations.

In the short run, there may be resistance to such a discipline by many Catholics who fall to the temptation and the trappings of secular society and will find it hard not to look back. There may be some who go to the civil authority to break their Catholic marriage with a divorce prior to counsel from the Church. Like Lot’s wife many will turn into pillars of salt.

Other concerns will include the Federal income tax situation for marriages not licensed by the several states. Will the IRS recognize unlicensed yet sacramental marriages? If it does not, this should be another indicator how American secular institutions are unfit for the recognition and defense of marriage. Federal tax issues could cause major interference in enacting such a discipline. If the IRS does not recognize unlicensed marriages, then would it be fair to ask new unlicensed sacramental marriages to be penalized on their taxes while older licensed sacramental marriages are not? If unlicensed Sacramental marriages are penalized, then I think that licensed Sacramental marriages may be called to file with such a penalty in solidarity to the unlicensed. These sacrifices would hurt, but they are small compared to the sacrifices made by the Church fathers and early Christians in their civil disobedience to the pagan gods of Rome.

I know the proposed discipline would be hard for American bishops to enact over their flocks, but it is time to understand the devastating affects American secular institutions have on marriage. They are burdens that weigh down on the sacrament and since this is so, how can we as Catholics seek salvation from the institutions causing such a burden? Only the Church can bring the sacrament of marriage back to the gentle Majesty of Christ, giving it rest from the secular strains in American society. We must take to heart Christ’s teaching through His Gospel:

""Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, I will give you rest.

Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart; and you will find rest for your selves. For my yoke is easy, and my burden light."" [Mat 11:28-30]

These are dangerous times for the Church and it may take the courage of a St. Thomas More or St. Thomas Becket for us to properly protect and defend the Sacrament of Marriage. I will pray for their intercession and do my part in the laity to bring misguided and fallen Catholics back to the Real Presence, as well as evangelize to all other non-Catholics.

It is time for the Catholic Church in America to recognize its proper place where it has a much greater authority than the American system of government. It is time for the Church to take action. Waiting for the state to take action, could take time and such actions will do serious harm to the Church. I hope the Church can see that using secular institutions like the modern American state will not help the defense of sacramental marriage. Rather, the Church must positively assert its authority over American Catholics in the aspect of marriage if it truly seeks to defend it in America.

From starting the war in the first place through outlawing the Ba’ath and sending the Iraqi army home to assaulting Fallujah and declaring war on Shiite militia leader Muqtada al-Sadr, we repeatedly get it wrong. Such consistency raises a question: can we identify a single factor that consistently leads us in the wrong direction?

I think we can. That is not to say other factors are not also in play. But one wrong notion does appear to underlie many of our blunders. That is the belief that in this war, the U.S. military is the strongest player.

We hear this at every level from the rifle squad to the White House. In Fallujah, Marine privates and sergeants want to finish the job of taking the city, with no doubt whatsoever that they can. In Baghdad, spokesmen for the CPA regularly trumpet the line that no Iraqi fighters can hope to stand up to the US military. Washington casts a broader net, boasting that the American military can defeat any enemy, anywhere. The bragging and self-congratulation reach the point where, as Oscar Wilde might have said, it is worse than untrue; it is in bad taste.

In fact, in Iraq and in Fourth Generation war elsewhere, we are the weaker party. The most important reason this is so is time.

For every other party, the distinguishing characteristic of the American intervention force is that it, and it alone, will go away. At some point, sooner or later, we will go home. Everyone else stays, because they live there.

This has many implications, none of them good from our perspective. Local allies know they will at some time face their local enemies without us there to support them. French collaborators with the Germans, and there were many, can tell us what happens then. Local enemies know they can outlast us. Neutrals make their calculations on the same basis; as my neighbor back in Cleveland said, one of Arabs’ few military virtues is that they are always on the winning side.

All our technology, all our training, all our superiority in techniques (like being able to hit what we shoot at) put together are less powerful than the fact that time is against us. More, we tend to accelerate the time disadvantage. American election cycles play a role here; clearly, that is what lies behind the June 30 deadline for handing Iraq over to some kind of Iraqi government. So does a central feature of American culture, the desire for quick results and ""closure."" Whether we are talking about wars or diets, Americans want action now and results fast. In places like Fallujah, that leads us to prefer assaults to talks. Our opponents, in contrast, have all the time in the world — and in the next world for that matter.

Time is not the only factor that renders us the weaker party. So does our lack of understanding of local cultures and languages. So also do our reliance on massive firepower, our dependence on a secure logistics train (we are now experiencing that vulnerability in Iraq, where our supply lines are being cut), our insistence on living apart from and much better than the local population. But time still overshadows all of these. Worse, we can do nothing about it, unless, like the Romans, we plan to stay for three hundred years.

Until we accept the counterintuitive fact that in Fourth Generation interventions we are and always will be the weaker party, our decisions will continue to be consistently wrong. The decisions will be wrong because the assumption that lies behind them is wrong. We will remain trapped by our own false pride.

What if we do come to understand our own inherent weakness in places like Iraq? Might we then come up with some more productive approaches? Well, the Byzantines might have something to teach us on that score. Greek fire notwithstanding, what kept the Eastern Roman Empire alive for a thousand years after Rome fell was knowing how to play weak hands brilliantly.

46233,"Recently by Eric Peters: Crime Does Pay

There are two main schools of thought when it comes to dealing with a cop during a traffic stop (or safety checkpoint). One of them is disgustingly obsequious, unworthy of a free people. The other is absolutely correct  in principle  but elements of it, if followed to the letter, can and probably will lead to unnecessary trouble.

The first school says Yes Sir and No Sir the cop, accede to his every request; be cooperative (that is, surrender all your rights) and Do As You Are Told. The problem with this approach is youre counting on the cop to be decent, which he may not be. And if hes not  if hes a bully with a badge (and yes, they exist) then your supine submission may actually egg him on. There are times when its critical to stand your ground. I dont mean be aggressive. I do mean dont be passive. If you make it clear that people  cops or otherwise  can walk all over you  well, usually they will do just that.

Ok, so whats the sensible middle ground? The practical, real-world smart way to handle a traffic stop?

First, make sure you never  ever  leave your driveway without your vehicle in legally faultless condition. All lights working, stickers up to date, etc. If you dont give them a reason to pull you, youve won before its begun.

Second, never leave your driveway without your license and whatever other paperwork the Clovers (government) have decreed we must always possess. I dont like it any more than you. But youre a noggin in search of a wood shampoo if you get stopped by a cop and assert Sovereign Citizen doctrine or some such. Im with you in principle. We should not have to carry papers in a free country and all the rest of it. But you will get exactly nowhere arguing this point with a cop. No, wait. Thats not quite true. You will get taken somewhere. To jail. This is to be avoided, if at all possible  unless you are that ardent about making a point, at least. Which if you are  bully. But most of us would prefer to just get away and go home for now.

Next, if Johnny Law appears on your bumper with his wig-wags flashing immediately slow, put on your turn signal and pull off the road  and as far off the road  as you reasonably can. Whether the stop is righteous or vicious, doesnt matter. Hes got the gun, the badge and the Authoritay. By pulling off as far as you can onto the shoulder, youll be showing consideration for officer safety, which may soften the cops attitude. For the same reason, turn on the dome light if its night, shut off the engine regardless  and put both hands on top of the steering wheel. Wait quietly.

Save the argument for later. Crack your window just enough to slip your license and registration paperwork through. Keep the door locked. Be civil  but not submissive. Dont let yourself be baited by the cop into any discussion that will lead to an admission of guilt  or admission of anything, for that matter. If he asks you questions, just shrug or, if you prefer, respond with a neutral, noncommittal statement. It is your right  but probably not wise  to quote the Bill of Rights. Probably it will just aggravate the cop  and while I dont give a damn about his feelings, I do understand that I am at his mercy in a situation like this. You should understand it, too. If it comes down to it, you should absolutely decline permission to search either your person or your vehicle. Say it loudly enough so that it will be picked up by the visual/auditory recording equipment almost all cops now have.

Make a recording. They are recording you  and whatever they record will be used against you. Make sure you can tell your side of things later on with the same incontrovertible there it is, right on the tape verisimilitude. But, dont make a big deal of it. In fact, try your best to make the recording without the cop knowing. It could mean all the difference if the cop is a bad apple  one of the alarmingly common control freak types, possibly hopped up on steroids and looking for a punching bag, that can be found all over YouTube and other citizen protest venues of late. Save the evidence for later, when you will be at a much reduced risk of street justice  and at the ugly mercy of a cops word vs. yours. And dont sweat the legality of recording a public official performing his public duties. While a few proto-Stalinist enclaves such as Illinois and Maryland have arrested citizens for recording cops, these cases have uniformly been tossed by the courts.

The bottom line goal is to get done with the stop and be on your way again as quickly as possible. To be as forgettable and anonymous as you can be. To avoid escalation. To improve your chances of beating the wrap later on in court  or by gaming the bureaucracy.

Always remember that as much as it sucks  as much as we value our natural rights as free men  when the deck is stacked against you, discretion can be the smarter part of valor.

500557,"New World Order propaganda rules and shapes the world. And there’s no more powerful propagator of propaganda that rules and shapes US global hegemony, world events and major geopolitical developments than the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR). On its own website, the CFR describes itself as “an independent, nonpartisan membership organization, think tank, and publisher.” Two weeks ago the powerful organization celebrated its 95th anniversary since it’s been the most influential force dictating US foreign policy throughout the 20th century chauvinistically called “the American century” right into the present 21st aptly called the New World Order century. The CFR is financed by highly endowed, tax-exempt Rockefeller, Ford, and Carnegie foundations.

The Bilderberg and CFR’s chosen member to become America’s next presidential puppet – Hillary Clinton – made no bones about whom she takes her NW Orders from:

“I am delighted to be here in these new headquarters. I have been often to, I guess, the mother ship in New York City, but it’s good to have an outpost of the Council right here down the street from the State Department. We get a lot of advice from the Council, so this will mean I won’t have as far to go to be told what we should be doing and how we should think about the future.” Family of Secrets: The... Russ Baker Best Price: $$3.95 Buy New $$16.99 (as of 09:55 EST - Details)

In 1950 the arrogant son of one of the Council on Foreign Relations’ founders, James Warburg emphatically decreed to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, “We shall have world government whether or not you like it – by conquest or consent.”

From its very outset, the CFR as the US elite’s most public face subversively promoting New World Order has always maintained one explicit purpose – to bring about a one world government. In 1975 powerful CFR insider and former Judge Advocate General of the US Navy Admiral Chester Ward wrote in his book entitled Kissinger on the Couch about the ultimate aim of the Council on Foreign Relations:

[The CFR has as a goal] submergence of US sovereignty and national independence into an all-powerful one-world government… this lust to surrender the sovereignty and independence of the United States is pervasive throughout most of the membership… In the entire CFR lexicon, there is no term of revulsion carrying a meaning so deep as ‘America First.’

Myths, Misunderstandings and Outright lies about owning Gold. Are you at risk?

Nearly all the top military generals (two active members were my West Point roommates) and admirals, major corporate CEO’s and numerous government leaders in all three branches have been circulating through the revolving turnstile in and out of the public sector as prominent Council on Foreign Relations members. They represent the shadowy government where secrecy rules from behind the scenes. That said, it’s a matter of public record that virtually every Secretary of Defense has been a CFR lifer. Since 1940 every Secretary of State but one has been on the CFR and/or Trilateral Commission, and a majority of Secretaries of Treasury as well. Multiple CIA directors have been in the CFR. For eight decades nearly every key National Security and Foreign Policy Advisor are/were members. And of course, a significant number of US presidents and VP’s have been CFR members. Regardless of what party happens to occupy the White House, an intransigent fixture operating at the highest echelons of power in Washington over the last century has been strategically assigned CFR plants.

The CFR’s interlocking marriage between the private corporate sector and the public government sector is largely responsible for today’s lopsided world of harsh gross disparities. As cases in point, the 62 richest people on earth possess more wealth than the majority of the 7.3 billion humans currently inhabiting the planet. The wealthiest 1% own more than the rest of the world combined and the global inequality gap between the rich and poor is widening at the fastest rate seen since the 19th century. These alarming facts bear the result that the ruling elite owns and controls all the Fortune 500 transnational corporations, through backroom bribery deals owns and controls virtually every national government on earth, and only six oligarchs own the six top mega-media corporations controlling the outflow of over 90% of the world’s news and information. Through monopolizing a centralized banking system of debt-based theft and global enslavement while imperialistically plundering the Third World for its precious natural resources, consolidation of power into fewer and fewer hands has eliminated competition in a closed, thoroughly insulated, anything but free, now stagnating global market. As an example, over the last two decades alone the number of publicly traded companies listed on the US stock exchange has been decimated in half, from 7,300 to 3,700. With the globalists wielding more power than ever before in human history, their centuries old, long sought after the scheme of a one world government has never been closer at hand.

The means by which our planetary rulers plan to attain their long prized agenda is through such Rockefeller-Rothschild created and funded entities as the United Nations and Council on Foreign Relations. Indeed CFR members calling themselves the Informal Agenda Group drafted the UN proposal that FDR signed the next day establishing the UN as a world governance precursor in 1945. That was then but this is now. The elite’s main ticket to deceptively achieve its diabolical endgame – one world governance – involves killing off 90% of us humans on earth through a meticulously plotted perfect storm of controlled chaos, destabilization and worldwide destruction through a huge arsenal of both soft and hard kill interventions that will allow the elite to entice obedience from remaining survivors under the assured promise of their protection and security. In effect, the murdering executioner at the same time will pretend to be the people’s savior. While purging roughly 6.5 billion of us “useless eating” overcrowd, under the deceitful cloak of Big Brotherly “love” in fork-tongued Orwellian doublespeak, the globalists will utilize carrot sticks of food and security to herd what’s left of the desperate masses into pre-designated FEMA prison camps and controlled bicoastal stacked hi-rise urban living zones per Agenda 21’s eminent domain that confiscates private property reserving a large vast interior section of the country as a designated wilderness area.

Proving the above point, at a 1992 Bilderberg meeting CFR guru Henry Kissinger said:

“Today, Americans would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restore order; tomorrow, they will be grateful. This is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all people of the world will plead with world leaders to deliver them from this evil… individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by their world government.”

Where the Olympics are being played in Rio now nearly a quarter century ago, 192 nations led by the most avid, out-of-the-closet New World Order President George “NWO” Bush signed on to UN Agenda 21 mapping out the earth’s “sustainable” dark future. Whereas Agenda 21 focuses on the environment, a “new and improved” formula – the 2030 Agenda – rolled out last September includes 17 highfalutin “Sustainable Development Goals,” all in flowery Orwellian lingo sounding so utopian in sheep’s clothing that when put into brutal practice by a predatory elite always spells dystopian madness and rigid authoritarian control.

Just one year ahead of that fateful 1992 global UN conference in Rio, the elite had already latched onto propagandized dogma spun from the notorious scientific think tank the Club of Rome to create a new post-cold war enemy of global warming as the juggernaut pretense leading to one world governance:

“In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill…. All these dangers are caused by human intervention…. The real enemy, then, is humanity itself.” The Brothers: John Fos... Stephen Kinzer Best Price: $$6.39 Buy New $$6.32 (as of 08:15 EST - Details)

Perhaps the Hegelian Dialectic best conceptualizes what deep state’s modus operandi is more clearly about than any other analytical descriptive lens. The elite’s been cagily repeating this same successful historical cycle, first identifying a problem that may or may not even be real, then intentionally induces a real or imagined crisis as a reaction to that problem for the purpose of proposing a solution that’s designed to increase centralized totalitarian control. Both US foreign and domestic policy have deployed this unbroken deceitful strategy that also often simultaneously utilizes a divide and conquer tactics to further weaken and neutralize any potential opposition. That’s why pitting groups like Democrat vs. Republican, liberal vs. conservative, white vs. black, Christian vs. Muslim against each other works so well. Also inventing derogatory labels designed to discredit and smear reputations like conspiracy theorist come in handy for the elite, the feds and mainstream media as a statist ministry of propaganda.

Assembling a diverse all-star cast of CFR members, the Council on Foreign Relations just released a self-serving infomercial video touting how significant and valuable its expertise role is in solving the complex challenges and problems facing humanity in the twenty-first century. In under three and a half minutes multiple sound bites delivered in rapid fire by strategically anointed elitists hailing from various walks of life are seen pontificating the need for CFR architects to masterfully craft such sound US foreign policy recommendations that promote peace, prosperity and New World Order wisdom.

In order of appearance are CFR president Richard Haass, CNN national security analyst Juliette Kayyem, former Treasury Secretary and CFR co-chair Robert Rubin, ABC news anchor Juju Chang, global head of Impact Investing at Goldman Sachs Dina Habib Powell, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Oscar-winning actress Angelina Jolie, the world’s largest book publisher Random House CEO Jon Meacham, Interfaith Center of New York Rev. Chloe Breyer, Park Avenue Synagogue Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove, HBO CEO Richard Plepler, President of Jigsaw (formerly Google Ideas) Jared Cohen, actor-producer Kalpen Modi, Time Magazine assistant managing editor Rana Foroohar, CNN GPS host Fareed Zakaria and Yahoo news anchor Bianna Golodryga.

The PR video attempts to pass the CFR off as a benign humanitarian group out to both enlighten and save the world. It’s featured CFR cheerleaders claim the organization is unbiased having no political ideology nor any agenda, which again is total bullshit as ever since 1921 its actions speak louder than their favorably biased words. The fact is the Council on Foreign Relations has been controlling US foreign policy for almost a century, and chief among its most obvious agendas has been building and maintaining US Empire’s global unipolar hegemony and military strength at all cost. This refusal to share power with Russia and China in a bipolar world has humanity today teetering on the brink of WWIII and self-annihilation. History has also proven that the CFR has long carried an aggressive war agenda responsible for virtually unending US military conflict. As the most warring nation on earth, 93% of its time in existence America’s been at war killing fellow humans somewhere on the planet. A Gallup poll several years ago showed that the rest of the world views the US as the greatest threat to world peace in no small measure due to CFR’s role shaping foreign policy. Of course, part and parcel of this war agenda is the unprecedented buildup of the arms industry and military industrial complex that Eisenhower gravely warned us against in vain largely due to CFR’s misguided influence. Enormous defense contractor giants like Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing and General Electric have been direct fat cat beneficiaries of the CFR war agenda making trillions in profit over the years thanks to the mutually self-serving Council on Foreign Relations.

And finally, the most glaring and subversively treasonous agenda of all that the Council on Foreign Relations has consistently maintained for near an entire century is the destruction of the United States as an independent, sovereign nation. The CFR has always envisioned and been working persistently towards a totalitarian one world government. Like so much corporate sponsored advertising, this CFR ad features powerful liars once again promising one thing and then betraying their promise by doing another. They clearly state that CFR has no agenda, yet the historical facts prove that the Council on Foreign Relations has always maintained the New World Order agenda of a one world government. As a truth seeker, I found the video a nauseating spectacle depicting card-carrying members shamelessly masturbating over their own self-importance as grotesquely obscene and repugnant to anyone half aware of the global mayhem, death and destruction that the Council on Foreign Relations has perpetrated on the world as the prime driver behind a century of US Empire aggression killing up to 30 million people since World War II.

The elitist propaganda machine is obviously working overtime, engaged in a thinly veiled political ad campaign, a sleek glossy facelift designed to upgrade its Mr. Burns-David Rockefeller, crotchety old white men rule-the-world image by appeasing and trying to win over a riled up American public ready to turn on its elite masters. After all, this year US citizens are fast realizing that everything we’ve been taught to believe in appears to just be a twisted crock of shit and that in reality, a full blown oligarchy has been masquerading as a propped up fake democracy, an overused misnomer from the red, white and blue days that’s long gone. Americans are just now starting to realize that the glorious US history taught in our whitewashed schoolbooks has methodically brainwashed multiple generations into wrongly believing America’s always been God’s gift and savior to humanity and the rest of the world. Tell that to all the darker skinned peoples around the globe who’ve been bombed, raped and murdered, starting on US soil with the Native Americans and kidnapped African slaves and their descendants.

The public is just now finally coming to terms with recognizing that the system’s been rigged against them for a long time. With Hillary’s criminal exposure, presidential elections are blatantly rigged, the two-tiered justice system is horrendously in-our-face rigged, the stock market’s rigged, gold prices are rigged. The dumbed down education system that extends even to higher learning is rigged, having turned generations of college grads into lifetime indentured servants now unemployed or working minimum wage jobs. While college grad wages increased only 1.6% in the last quarter century, the student debt burden has skyrocketed 163.8%. The US meritocracy work ethic that preaches working hard all your life eventually pays off is rigged because the entire Ponzi schemed economy’s been rigged ever since the 1913 Federal Reserve Act. Placing privatized central banksters in charge of the nation’s money supply manufacturing paper fiat out of thin air while charging interests off invisible reserves that don’t even exist has given the elite unlimited power to infiltrate and hijack our government through organizations like the Federal Reserve and CFR that have systematically degenerated our once vibrant democratic republic into a fascist totalitarian police state on the verge of utter collapse.

The fact is that in this highly polarized, explosive culture of growing violence, fear, hate, distrust, ignorance and xenophobic scapegoating, one angry, politically incorrect, racist, narcissistic white billionaire-showman promising delusions of grandeur to bring back America’s long lost “greatness” is upsetting the elite’s apple cart, threatening to throw a monkey wrench into the status quo of the rigged power structure. This unpredictable, recklessly volatile dynamic currently gripping America has the divided populace ever more agitated, unstable and angry over facing the cold hard reality that the nation so many of us grew up loving has been thoroughly fleeced and destroyed by the treasonous Clinton-Bush-Obama international crime cabal that governs the world employing the same bloody, lawless thuggery as organized crime. Their ruthlessly violent, demonically motivated tactics are one and the same, only the ruling elite and their political and corporate puppets have historically enjoyed a deceptive, undeserved legitimacy not afforded the mafia.

Despite what the CFR infomercial claims, history explicitly exposes the Council on Foreign Relations’ relentless real agenda of one world governance that from behind the scenes is already informally operating, and how its promotion of global warming, global scarcity, global overpopulation, global terrorism, global refugee crises, global war and global economic collapse, all have been covertly contrived, manipulated and engineered by the ruling elite. The elite’s not so secret, the final objective is to finalize a cashless, RFID microchipped society comprised of a mere half to one billion humans left living on the earth under the absolute tyranny and control of an entrenched one world government and one world religion that at every chance Pope Francis is constantly pushing. No matter how sugarcoated or saccharine a feeble CFR attempt at image enhancement to convince a forsaken American citizenry to trust its executioner in sheep’s clothing will not change the sobering reality. As a war machine maker, the Council on Foreign Relations should remain an enemy to every citizen of the world who values and desires peace and freedom.

I happened to be standing behind the lady, and she raised her hand in anger. “It’s Bessie the dog,” I stammered. “What is wrong with you? I don’t do that anymore.” The lady in question is of a certain age, and the last one at the party I’d goose, but such are the joys of a bad reputation.

Oh, yes, before I forget: Marina, Princess of Savoy, who one month ago accused me of having locked her up for two days aboard my boat, has now recanted, and admits it was another awful Greek shipowner who did the dastardly deed.

As always, what bliss it is to feel healthy again. In fact, it leads to far too much partying as a result. Arki Busson, the seducer, and impregnator of film stars and hedge-fund manager extraordinaire blew into town, staying next door chez Geoffrey Moore. I was best man at Arki’s parents’ wedding more than fifty years ago, and such was the ensuing disaster, no one has ever asked me to perform that task again. But I love Arki because he is a very bad boy in the good sense of the word. His arrival at my new chalet caused an upheaval. We stayed up until 5 a.m. and left the place looking like a Cuban (before Castro) whorehouse on a Sunday morning. The MoMC was not best pleased, but she too loves Arki, so all was forgiven.

The festivities continued high up at the Eagle Club the next day, but wiser heads prevented me from attending. My son stood in for his grievously hungover father, and by taking a day off I was able to rejoin the fiesta until Arki finally bade us goodbye and flew off to Hong Kong and pressing business deals with the tricky Chinese. The other good news is that Michael Mailer flew over from New York and hit the party scene without missing a beat. He went off skiing with me on no sleep, and after the all-night blast skied with my speed-demon son and made it back alive.

Believe me, if anyone has cause to complain about bad language, that person is I. I taught for over forty years and during those decades, I had words of every length, meaning, reference, and suggestion, spit directly into my face, an inch from my nose, with threats that a fist would follow them. Those words were shouted by innumerable frustrated teen boys who were unforgivably failed by our public school system. Those boys had trusted that their teachers would teach them to read but instead, the boys had arrived in my classroom as illiterate, volatile, failing 10th graders.

Our males need locker rooms where they can speak freely without fear of recriminations, so I taught my boys to go there instead of speaking offensively in my classroom, the hallways, or around society. I taught them how to differentiate between various levels of English: Standard English; Queen’s English; Home English; Schoolyard English; Locker Room English; Dialect English. I taught that dialects are appropriate—at proper times; in proper places; but use at school while learning how to read, write, and the spell is neither the place nor the timing for speaking with dialects. We discussed Family English and I explained that my deaf brother could never say “whipped cream.” My family has continued to use Reed’s pronunciation since his death in 1973, but that we never ask for “creama whippa” when shopping. Most importantly, my students were told that I was never to hear Locker Room English spoken outside of the Locker Room. I am proud to report that those boys, now grown men, continue to show great respect, never using locker room language within my hearing.

No, it has been the supposedly educated reporters, journalists, and talk show hosts of FoxNews, CNN, MSNBC, CBS, The Daily Mail, and other media sources who decided to again assault my senses and defile my world.

Plus decades of Bill Clinton. I will never forget the morning that our local CBS affiliate broadcast decadence to hundreds of preschool and school-age children across Cadillac and northwest Lower Michigan. I have often wondered if those reporters even considered what might happen after they publically described Bill Clinton’s trashy lifestyle during the breakfast hour. My four year old turned to me and asked, “Mom, what is oral sex, anyway?” Yes, Willy spoke and acted outside the walls of the locker room, just like the animals on Animal Planet and NatGeo do, thus exposing previously guarded areas of life to sheltered, innocent children. Still, there were enough stupid and/or trained-seal Democrats to vote him a second term. The thought that there may be enough non-thinking and trained voters to elect his nasty, dishonest wife, as well, thoroughly chills the blood.

We need locker rooms and private spaces where people can speak freely and occasionally even talk too much. Women do, as well, and should admit it instead of pretending to be oh, so shocked by that tape recording. We do not meet in locker rooms. We have events where we discuss men and the shadier sides of life: bridal showers; home decorating parties; Tupperware parties. In Chile, such gatherings are referred to as “LuLu Parties,” named after the old cartoon character, Little LuLu. One evening, just as our party was starting, a man knocked. The women rushed the door and for a moment I feared the ladies would tear the fellow apart for daring to show up at a LuLu Party! He had merely stopped to ask his wife a question! Here in America, women rent male strippers, bow ties and all, for some events (but not much else comes with the “all”, don’t cha know). Yes, we must not act holier than the men.

We all must stop this silly finger pointing and theatrical, insincere gasps of false offense. We have a wonderful country to save and the days we have left in which to save it are quickly becoming fewer. The villain here is not Donald Trump. The villains are 1) Sneaky Sleeze, the male who took a tape player into a locker room to betray fellow males, and 2) Hilary Clinton, with her evil plans for America, her possible hiding of dangerous health issues, her probable acceptance of foreign monies for State Department favors, her destruction of public property, her refusal to comply with subpoenas, her willingness to protect her sexual predator husband, and the list continues. It is those two who should be publically humiliated and drummed out of the system, not a hard working, committed presidential candidate who loves America.

Donald Trump had every reason to believe that he was in a time-honored environment protected by a time-honored Code of Ethics. He had every reason to believe that he could safely relax and stretch some tales, rambling on as males have done in locker rooms and men’s club all across this land for centuries. Donald’s ramblings were eleven, meaningless, long ago years ago. They would not even have been noticed; they would have been completely forgotten except for that treacherous, evil spy who plotted to damage a fellow male. Despicable.

What is it that males and educated journalists do not “get” about the Locker Room Code of Conduct with its purpose of protecting each other as well as the culture? Are your characters only lightly spray painted on with water soluble ink?

We all realize that male animals publically strut their stuff without a thought for whom or what is observing or close at hand. Such is Nature’s way. Elephant seals viciously tear at each other with huge tusks, squashing baby seals as they shove each other around the beach. Bull elephants flap their huge ears as they charge any interloper after tearing up a tree or two. Big horn sheep but heads and rudely kick each other in the privates. Dogs kick dirt and piddle on tires, fence posts, and tree trunks. Deer shake big racks before poking each other in attempts to draw blood. It is a male thing, across every land, around the entire world.

Luckily for women, human males, other than for the occasional street brawl and declared war, usually carry out their bravado in the privacy of forests, barns, and locker rooms, away from the sight and hearing of women and children. That was, of course, until civic-minded (not!) reporters like Geraldo felt that they just owed it to the culture to trash it by broadcasting eleven year ago locker room exaggerations so that women could hear what men say in private. (Shall we show our appreciation by turning off our televisions for a week or more?) One British news agency could not wait to report what Trump had said about his daughter, to which my reaction was, “Good for you, Donald! It is nice to know a man who allows his daughters to become women.” Too many a daughter stays trapped as “Daddy’s Little Girl”.

Thank you, Geraldo. Thank you, talk show hosts. Thank you, devious RINOs.

I am being facetious, of course, because no female wants to hear locker room language and have her children exposed to it. Everyone working in media is aware of that. Why else did they try so hard to explain and justify why they just had to break that Code of Conduct and betray another male? They knew they would hurt people in the process but could not resist working the story for effect while pretending to be so High and Mighty. Truthfully, you betrayers look so much shorter, and sound so much dumber, now that we have seen you wearing your true colors, displaying your actual characters.

By the way, what are you planning for your follow-up low? Dirt kicking, antler rattling, or will you stoop to piddle on tires?

375482,"Henry Kissinger is out with an essay in the Wall Street Journal “on the Assembly of a New World Order” (HT Ed Steer). Some parts of it are rather difficult to understand or interpret (is it written in code that only the elite can decipher?). I will attempt to go through it line by line (probably not every single line) and see if, by the time I finish, I can make some sense of it.

Libya is in civil war, fundamentalist armies are building a self-declared caliphate across Syria and Iraq and Afghanistan’s young democracy is on the verge of paralysis.

Translated: Pretty much everything touched by the US government in the last ten years has turned into a disaster.

To these troubles are added a resurgence of tensions with Russia and a relationship with China divided between pledges of cooperation and public recrimination.

Translated: Look, Nixon and I handed China to you on a silver platter; the Soviets crumbled just as Mises said they must (whoops, I let that slip – is it too late to take it back? I meant because Reagan spent the Soviets into bankruptcy). So, basically, pretty much everything touched by the US government in the last ten years has turned into a disaster.

The concept of order that has underpinned the modern era is in crisis.

Hopefully, my emphasis on this point has properly conveyed that I consider this opening paragraph to offer an important admission by Henry.

The search for world order has long been defined almost exclusively by the concepts of Western societies. In the decades following World War II, the U.S.—strengthened in its economy and national confidence—began to take up the torch of international leadership and added a new dimension.

Translated: The US government was sitting in the cat-bird’s seat coming out of World War Two, virtually unscathed and in control of every meaningful global institution.

A nation founded explicitly on an idea of free and representative governance, the U.S. identified its own rise with the spread of liberty and democracy and credited these forces with an ability to achieve just and lasting peace.

It is interesting that he uses the term “governance” and not government. In any case, here Henry is spitting out the party line that the US spread its influence far and wide only for the benefit of bringing “free and representative governance” to the downtrodden (brown and yellow, usually) people of the world.

The traditional European approach to order had viewed peoples and states as inherently competitive; to constrain the effects of their clashing ambitions, it relied on a balance of power and a concert of enlightened statesmen.

Europe always played it strategically via balance-of-power politics. This, of course, left one side out of Anglo-elite influence. The American approach (not to mention the American military and economic power) broadened the reach of the elite.

The prevalent American view considered people inherently reasonable and inclined toward peaceful compromise and common sense; the spread of democracy was therefore the overarching goal for international order.

Translated: Democracy fooled the Americans into thinking they were free; we thought that it would fool all of those brown and yellow people, too.

Free markets would uplift individuals, enrich societies and substitute economic interdependence for traditional international rivalries.

Translated: This is why we never allowed free markets to develop.

This effort to establish world order has in many ways come to fruition. A plethora of independent sovereign states govern most of the world’s territory.

Translated: The objective was to establish a plethora of superficially independent sovereign states governing all of the world’s territories. Through these sovereign states, control could be exercised over the people now being fooled into believing that the government represented their interests. And the states were allowed to remain superficially sovereign as long as they didn’t want to become actually sovereign (e.g. Hussein and Gadhafi).

The years from perhaps 1948 to the turn of the century marked a brief moment in human history when one could speak of an incipient global world order composed of an amalgam of American idealism and traditional European concepts of statehood and balance of power.

Most of the period cited by Henry includes the so-called cold war with the Soviet Union. The period also included communist China supposedly apart from the west. Yet, here he declares something approaching victory. Were China and Russia in on the game? Or were they more like useful foils in extending the game?

Henry sees trouble brewing: “The order established and proclaimed by the West stands at a turning point.” In different ways, Barzun and Van Creveld would say the same thing.

First, the nature of the state itself—the basic formal unit of international life—has been subjected to a multitude of pressures.

Henry goes on to explain some of these “pressures,” for example, that the European amalgamation is not going so well, “…Europe has not yet given itself attributes of statehood, tempting a vacuum of authority internally and an imbalance of power along its borders.”

It is interesting how casually he mentions, almost as an aside, that the objective was to create a single, unified, European state.

Further, the Middle East is coming apart:

At the same time, parts of the Middle East have dissolved into sectarian and ethnic components in conflict with each other; religious militias and the powers backing them violate borders and sovereignty at will, producing the phenomenon of failed states not controlling their own territory.

While likely to have happened eventually anyway (arbitrary borders established in Paris at the end of the Great War were not going to last forever), clearly the US government moved this along significantly.

The international order…faces a paradox: Its prosperity is dependent on the success of globalization, but the process produces a political reaction that often works counter to its aspirations.

This strikes me as a second important admission. Europe is one of the key battlegrounds in this “paradox.” Will the EU (and/or the common currency) be able to hold it together? Will the centralization be able to withstand the corresponding decrease in productivity and therefore standard-of-living? We are witnessing this battle being played out in real time in Europe.

A third failing of the current world order, such as it exists, is the absence of an effective mechanism for the great powers to consult and possibly cooperate on the most consequential issues.

What?!?! I won’t bother mentioning here all of the global / international bodies put in place during the last century – and especially after the war ended in 1945. What is Henry talking about?

This may seem an odd criticism in light of the many multilateral forums that exist—more by far than at any other time in history.

That’s what I just said! This, I believe, is a third important admission.

The penalty for failing will be not so much a major war between states (though in some regions this remains possible) as an evolution into spheres of influence identified with particular domestic structures and forms of governance.

Two key takeaways here: first, the elite cannot afford “a major war between states” any more than the rest of us can – nukes don’t differentiate, and cannot be defended against; second, the idea of “spheres of influence” echoes Barzun’s speculation of what might lie ahead. From Barzun: “The numerous regions of the Occident and America formed a loose confederation obeying rules from Brussels and Washington in concert…”

“Loose confederation” of the west and “spheres of influence” globally seem rather the same thing.

Henry goes on to describe how difficult the task is of bringing billions of people under one umbrella – too many of us billions don’t always go along with the man behind the curtain, it seems. He asks a series of questions that he believes the US government must confront – none very important to me or this post. He then lays the challenge in front of the US government leaders:

For the U.S., this will require thinking on two seemingly contradictory levels. The celebration of universal principles needs to be paired with recognition of the reality of other regions’ histories, cultures and views of their security.

This objective is fundamental to the disasters that the US government has created in the Middle East and North Africa. Not “seemingly contradictory”; just plain old “contradictory.” An impossible task when those being “securitized” (for lack of a better word, yet actually perfectly appropriate in every sense; “The Securitization of Humanity” sounds like a good title for an upcoming post) do not choose to be.

So, I have identified what I believe to be several important admissions; I will pull these together here:

1) We were doing such a fine job of consolidating the new world order, yet in the last ten years or so the US government has pretty much messed up everything it has touched.

2) The new world order was supposed to globalize the economy under one over-arching government (via institutions put in place not later than the end of WWII).

3) The international bodies put in place over the last century – and especially since 1945 – have failed. The people aren’t going along, instead producing “a political reaction that often works counter to its aspirations.”

Now, I will admit that someone viewing Henry’s essay through a different lens could come to different conclusions. I admit I have a particular view on the goings-on around us: global governance and consolidation has seen its best days, at least for this era. Things are coming apart – and the primary tool used in the last 70 years (the US government) has not only failed, it is getting too dangerous for even the survival of the elite. There is no easily co-opted “next” (e.g. China) to ride on this parade toward global government. It is time to back off, at least for now.

I conclude Henry has this same view.

Open Letters





I

wrote in November

that Ron Paul has a very good chance at winning the GOP presidential

nomination due to his enthusiastic support. The purpose of the current

essay is to re-examine this hypothesis after the amazing Q4 fundraising.

Just to give it all away up front: Ron Paul can win the Iowa caucus.

In the theme

of Open

Letters started by Walter Block, this is an open letter to anyone

(but especially Iowans given that tomorrow is the big day) that

thinks voting for Ron Paul is “wasting a vote.” The idea that votes

are wasted is usually a valid concern in a democracy. But, the Iowa

caucus tends to have a low turnout (6% to 7% in the last two presidential

rounds), so an outpouring of support from a dedicated base can make

a huge difference. That is, if the overall voter turnout is low,

your vote counts more than if everybody in the state casts a ballot.

The downside is that a state like New Hampshire, where Ron Paul

consistently polls well but has a 50% voter turnout, is actually

more difficult to win (but keep reading for the silver lining).

Minority

Rules

One thing that

I’ve been thinking about since my last essay is whether it is a

good thing that in a democracy, the minority can win. I say this

because, although there are a number of Ron Paul supporters, I think

it is safe to say that we are not the majority of the public. Yet,

we are more fervent and can change the outcome of this election,

as well as the future of this country, using the democratic process.

Overall, I think many LRC readers will have already concluded that

this is a major problem with democracy: “Democracy is the system

in which 51% of the people tell the other 49% what to do.” But should

I feel bad about using the system to my advantage?

I’m okay with

using the system for two reasons. First, elections are already decided

by the minority: the political class. As

Higgs writes, “the oligarchs, the Praetorian Guards, and the

supporting coalition — uses government power (which means ultimately

the police and the armed forces) to exploit everyone outside this

class by wielding or threatening to wield violence against all who

fail to pay the tribute the oligarchs demand or to obey the rules

they dictate.” This, of course, includes the MSM, which has been

pushing for Clinton 44 for a decade.

Second, the

message is wonderful: FREEDOM. We just want to tell the “other 49%”

to not infringe on anyone’s rights to life, liberty, and property.

So we are the

polar-opposite of the current ruling class fighting for the freedom

of everyone else. How could I feel bad about that???

The Numbers

Last time,

I used the latest CNN poll. It was put out on Nov 5th,

so it did not include the post-money bomb poll boosts for Paul.

I concluded that if, using a national average for polling and voter

turnout, Ron Paul would win the nomination by a small margin if

only 50% of his supporters tromped off to the polls. I repeated

this analysis using the most

recent CNN poll, which was done Dec 6th9th

(i.e., after the first money bomb and before the second).

I also used a different voter turnout of 9.8%, thanks to an LRC

reader who sent me this

link (Thanks, EL! Note: I averaged 2000 Super Tuesday turnout

to get 9.8%). The results? Ron Paul wins the nomination with a 6%

lead over Giuliani!

But, EL and

others who wrote to me in November pointed out that the national

averages are tricky. Voter turnout varies a lot from state to state,

and this year we have a Super Duper Tuesday, which could really

throw things off. So I used the pollster.com

averages for national and state voting, along with the individual

state turnouts from the 2000 primaries. Pollster.com averages

recent polls from various sources, so it is a conservative estimate

of how the vote may go. Yes, I am still assuming that these polls

are accurate, so if Ron Paul comes in at 4% nationally, I say that

4% of registered voters favor him. As has been pointed

out

many

times

on LRC,

these polls are probably very inaccurate. But since they are underestimating

Paul’s support, my analysis is a conservative view and the conclusions

hold in that Paul will do “better than expected.”

So what is

the silver-lining on Ron Paul losing New Hampshire? Well, first,

he’s going to have amazing momentum after handily winning Iowa,

so he probably won’t end up 5th. Second, the spread in

South Carolina, and presumably other states with moderate 20% turnout

is 10-points between first and last…not exactly a comfortable

lead for the “top-tier” guys. Third, Romney wins New Hampshire,

but he’s not in the running nationwide, so it won’t matter.

And, finally,

the worst-case scenario, using the MSM polling numbers: Ron Paul

ends up in a national 3-way tie with Giuliani and Huckabee, so it

goes to convention. And we all know that the motivated Paul base

has been planning for convention and is ready to take it by storm.

So, to conclude

my Open Letter to Iowa Skeptics: The message is powerful. The support

is real. And Ron Paul will give us our nation back if we fight for

the message for eleven more months.

22902,"Recently by Robert Wenzel: Global Insiders Warned: U.S. Debt Crisis Could Explode atAnytime

More than 15 years ago, Murray Rothbard pointed out the problems with fluoridation. He pointed out the immorality of adding fluoride to the water, that the science was bad, and that the entire fluoridation movement was engineered by the corporate elite.

Now a few NYC politcos are trying to end the fluoridation of water, largely because the science behind fluoridation is, as Rothbard argued, terrible.

On January 18, 2011, NYC Council Member Peter Vallone, Jr. introduced legislation (Int 0463-2011) prohibiting the addition of fluoride to the water supply. Five additional NYC Council Members have co-sponsored the bill (Council Members Cabrera, Crowley, Foster, Williams and Halloran).

Vallone writes on his website, There is a growing body of evidence that fluoride does more harm than good. Recently, two federal government agencies admitted that US children are fluoride-overdosed and it’s ruining their teeth and may be damaging their bones.(1) The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports that over 41% of adolescents suffer with dental fluorosis  white spotted, yellow, brown and/or pitted teeth  4% of it severe. (2) The Mayo Clinic, CDC and the American Dental Association advise that infant formula NOT be mixed with fluoridated water, but do little to educate the public about this dire warning.

22872,"Recently by Anthony Wile: Will the Market Do What Western LeadersCannot?

Here at the Daily Bell, we remain convinced that America’s serial wars have continually deepened that great country’s economic crisis. And this gives rise to a peculiar dilemma that we don’t usually point out, but which will be the purpose of this article. It may even explain the reluctance of the US to leave Afghanistan and to generally disengage from overseas violence.

This is the issue: ""How can the US cease its warring when so many people in that beleaguered country depend on conflict for their employment?""

The US unemployment or under-employment rate (the real one) is somewhere between 25 and 30 percent. To reduce or eliminate garrisons in both Iraq and Afghanistan would inject hundreds of thousands of additional individuals into an economy that is struggling to provide employment to available workers. (Not to mention the private-sector ""defense"" jobs that would be made redundant.) And assuming that the additional workers find jobs; wouldn’t they be at substantially lower salaries than their existing military compensations?

(Ed Note: The Daily Bell is aware of ""the broken window"" fallacy regarding the profitability of war; and this has been a subject of discussion previously. In the long term, war creates nothing but misery and debt. But in the short-term it is indisputable that it can provide a temporary economic stimulus  as well as a diversion  especially if the country controls the world’s reserve currency. See additional comments in feedback thread.)

It is certainly easier to get into a war than to get out of one. Of course, here I am referring to the visible wars only, those which comprise millions of Americans who are earning wages that would otherwise not exist and for whom many would find their current skills not in great demand in peacetime.

It appears on surface that the US could not afford this influx of unemployed and any reigning political body would be committing domestic economic suicide should they chose to truly adopt a non-aggressive foreign policy and return America to protecting its own shores rather than spreading ""democracy"" all over the world. And here clearly we at the Bell believe that is ALL the US military should be doing. And we also believe that would require a personnel effort of much smaller numbers than taxpayers are currently supporting.

Were the US to suffer such an influx of unemployed as a result of adopting a sensible foreign policy rather than acting as the policemen for global morality, it is likely that trade unions and other leftist organizations would demand the existing wages of the military workers be maintained at current levels. Of course Congress would attempt to pass wage support legislation to ensure that standards of living didn’t suffer in the new careers sought but to what overall detriment to the value of the dollar?

The bottom line is that the US economy cannot handle a peaceful withdrawal from active combat without causing even further unemployment, not just to those on the front lines but to all the industries who comprise the vertical support network which keeps the whole clock ticking. And for politicos intent on battling an already raging domestic unemployment crises, caused primarily by the country’s out-of-control Federal Reserve, it is ironic that the current and future administrations of the US have no way out of this mess.

If the US doesn’t stop the spending insanity of supporting multi war fronts, the monetary base will continue to expand and the dollar’s value will continue to plunge toward its true nominal worth  which is surely zero, the inevitable graveyard for all fiat currencies. But should America’s leaders decide to withdraw, unemployment will surely deepen, perhaps considerably, and the economy will tumble deeper into depression, causing the Fed to inflate even faster  thus sending the dollar to its fiat funeral, anyway.

It is a sad testament that there appears to be no way out: The US dollar and the US economy are in for further suffering whether the wars continue or not. Millions of lives will continue to be disrupted and many more will die to support the borders of empire and the value of an already dead currency.

America’s founding fathers knew that war was a terrible venture and one that should only be entered into with utmost’s seriousness, in order to defend the very existence of the country itself. By constantly pursuing wars and allowing Congress to abrogate its duty as the final arbitrator, the American powers-that-be have placed the country in a perilous economic condition.

If troops return home, the already weakened economy will suffer further; if the fighting continues, the economy will suffer as well  and most seriously (in part because the US military industrial complex doesn’t wish for a reversion to a peacetime economy). Wars are a last resort, and not to be entered into lightly. Leaving aside the moral issues and the terrible loss of life, and looked at from a purely economic perspective (as the elite apparently tends to do) there are no easy answers and plenty of painful days ahead for those unprepared.

Sometimes there is a spouse who is physically ill, sometimes their loved ones just don’t u201Cget itu201D. Besides expressing their deep longing to live the way we do — personally free and self-sufficient — they give us their apologies for not being able to join us. No apology needed.

To make the decision to stay in the midst of the coming chaos because those to whom you have a deep and loving commitment cannot wrest themselves from their current lifestyle is also a valid and courageous choice — as long as it is made with good information and open eyes. When chaos arrives (and it’s coming on a fast track) those who remain dependent on the systems (corporate, medical, governmental entitlements such as food stamps, disability payments, etc.) will likely be left in the lurch and fending for themselves anyway, but whatever they have to go through, they can hold their heads up as they fight through the throngs of panicked people who don’t understand what happened, and know that theirs was a conscious decision, not a blind following. To those who are staying behind for the sake of others, and not using that as an excuse to stay in what now seems a comfy situation themselves, we applaud your courage and your valor.

We’re not talking about people who can’t bring themselves to give up their six-figure job or their 62u201D plasma TV in order to live a more natural life, regardless of what does or doesn’t happen u201Cout thereu201D. Nor are we talking about those who say they are ready, willing and able to change their lifestyle, then fold in the crunch and let their u201Coutside worldu201D ways encroach on what could be a virtually Utopic scenario, hoping that the roadsigns are not really pointing to the edge of a cliff, so to speak. If they believe that the self-sufficient life is just too strenuous for them to deal with, wait till they experience the hardships of the coming realities.

Of course, the self-sufficient, not-dependent-on-the-system life is not for everyone, anyway. You have to have — pardon the expression — balls of steel, while not letting your heart get to the same condition. When others who are jealous of your freedom tell you you’re crazy and do what they can to discourage you, you have to remember that it is their own choices they are feeling guilty about. When you are so confident of your own abilities that you can offer kindness to others and that kindness is seen as a signal to take advantage of you, you have to be able not to take it personally. When you run out of something you thought you’d never run out of and you can’t get to the store to replenish it, you have to be able to get creative and learn how to live without something you thought you couldn’t live without — and you find you can. You have to be able to look at what is going on u201Cout thereu201D and understand that the daily challenges you face are not out of your control, but that they are all surmountable by yourself, and that you are up to the task by virtue of your own abilities, your own strength and intelligence, and your own connection to the universal energy of which we are all a part.

So if you choose to stay in the cities, in suburbia, in the system, don’t apologize. To make a choice is a courageous act — more courageous than simply allowing yourself to be blown by any wind that comes along. But don’t forget that it is your choice and that you still have the right — no, the responsibility to yourself — to make one.

466896,"David Boaz has pointed out the futility of looking towards the past. How far do we look? As a transplanted Westerner (Nevada) living happily in the South I think we may have an answer. As a Libertarian living under Washingtonian tyranny I would find it pleasurable to look back to a time when Washington's brutal fist wasn't in a locked grip around the throat of free men. When was this Mr. Boaz? When the French controlled Mississippi? No, instead it was the grip of just as brutal and parasitic Frenchmen rather than a fellow American, strangling the spirit and souls of free men. To look back and find a time where the grip of a centralized tyranny was challenged, though unsuccessfully, we must look back to the period of time embodied by the Stars and Bars and the Confederate battle flag.

The blood of tyrants and patriots must be shed in the name of liberty. Unfortunately too little of the former and too much of the latter was shed during the War of Northern Aggression ( or the Civil War as I'm sure that Mr. Boaz would like to call it, as a sure sign of submission to Washington and its PC enforcers). As Mr. Boaz should know the ""War"" had little to do with freedom and everything to do with slavery. No man was freed as a result of Northern victory, only the Yoke of slavery was extended around the necks of those who could have claimed to be free prior to the ""War"". Tax slavery was extended, the concept of total war was realized and the strength of D.C. was increased. That one could say that the cause of liberty was advanced after the war is to claim that the income tax, and the welfare/warfare state are improvements over conditions prior to the war. Is Mr. Boaz prepared to make this statement?

Maybe he is. There are those that believe the state can only be defeated by actually fighting against it and those who believe that at least their own circumstances can be improved by making compromises with it. Mr. Boaz and his Cato and Reason allies belong to the latter. Why not sacrifice the glory of the south and the battle flag of the confederacy, if it will gain one legitimacy within the establishment?

Why not? I think the answer comes from the essence of what one must do to gain this legitimacy, agree with the state. A writer can hang in the wings and wait to gain the attention of his rulers and the boorish press that glorifies a group of sub rate men graced with the power of democracy. The great men in today's world are not rulers, but rather entrepreneurs who change our world for the better through their innovations and improvements. They are not the vote whoring morons catering to the fickal musings of disinterested voters and the media propagandists who commentate on politics having studied journalism. Boaz and his ilk would rather influence and gain the acceptance of these types than belong to the group of people who actually change and improve our world. I charge Boaz with second handism. In his search for acceptance, he has become a member of the class he desires the attention of.

I cannot claim a Southern heritage, but I can admire that group of men who fought the tyrants of D.C. While they may not have freed the black man, they did not enslave those in possession of their freedom in the brutal and barbaric fashion that Lincoln and his successors have. God save Dixie may not be a cry for perfection, only one for improvement. When the Stars and Stripes, a sign of Washingtonian dominance to both Nevadan's and Southerners, can escape Mr. Boaz's criticism, while he rails against the rebellious battle flag of the confederacy, there appears to be a contradiction in his thought. Why cry out against the flag of a nation that never freed the black man, without criticizing the flag of a nation that enslaved all.

737329,"At the end of the First World War, iconoclastic American journalist Randolph Bourne famously warned, “War is the health of the state.” He had witnessed the unprecedented expansion of national power in the heat of war mobilization. Twenty years ago, political scientist Bruce D. Porter likewise argued, “States make war, but war also makes states.” For the losers, of course, unsuccessful war destroys states, but the hundred years since the outbreak of the Great War in 1914 ought to make the symbiosis between warfare and Leviathan obvious.

Do we find similar tendencies when we turn from war and politics to war and religion? Does religion make war? In the case of the Crusades and the 16th-century wars of religion, the answer might seem obvious. But it would be hard to argue conversely that “war is the health of religion” or that “war makes the church (or the mosque).” Nevertheless, from antiquity to the present day, religion has shaped war and war has shaped religion, sometimes consciously and deliberately, sometimes with consequences evident only generations later, and always with complex twists and turns.

In The Great and Holy War, Baylor historian Philip Jenkins explores this two-way relationship in the extraordinary circumstances of World War I. Known for his sweeping global histories of Christianity, Jenkins explores the religious “mood” and motivations that, in his judgment, pervaded all sides of the Great War. Inexplicably, in the century since the war, no scholar has attempted this sort of comparative religious history of a conflict that did so much to remake Europe, her far-flung colonies, and the United States. Such neglect is unaccountable given how prominently religion appeared in the war’s rhetoric and symbolism, whether from official propaganda, belligerent clergy, or common soldiers. Jenkins’s volume comes, then, as a welcome contribution to scholarly understanding of the relationship between religion and the First World War and the consequences of that volatile mixture down to the present day.

In 448 brisk pages, Jenkins manages to cover the major Allied and Central powers, the United States, the Ottoman Empire, the emergent Middle East, Africa, India, and South Asia. He compares the experiences of Protestants, A Peace to End All Pea... David Fromkin Best Price: $$7.99 Buy New $$11.69 (as of 03:00 EST - Details) Catholics, Orthodox Christians, Jews, Muslims, and Hindus. He argues that religion entered into the motivations of the great powers as one among many causes of the war, and for Germany and Russia in particular as a driving force inseparable from those other causes. Jenkins leaves no doubt that Christianity, Judaism, and Islam contributed language, imagery, intensity, and even whole theological frameworks to the war and that adherents found their beliefs mobilized from the first shot to the last for the deadliest war the world had yet known.

Jenkins challenges conventional notions of just how secular the West had become by the early 20th century. He shows first that the generation of 1914, both at home and at the Front, carried existing religious beliefs, practices, and expectations with them. Soldiers and their families seemed to find it easy to believe rumors and press reports about the dead rising on the battlefield to fight again, prophecies, appearances of angels, and visions of Jesus himself and the Virgin Mary, such as the famous visitation at Fatima in Portugal. People routinely “biblicized” the war and invoked the aid of such Christian heroes as St. George and Joan of Arc. But “religion” did not always mean orthodox ideas and practices; it often embraced mysticism, spiritualism, the occult, and communication with the dead to find meaning in a world gone mad.

373667,"“Does anyone seriously believe that people who are prepared to defy the laws against murder are going to obey laws against owning guns or large-capacity magazines?” — Thomas Sowell

I have watched the debate over gun control for almost 50 years. I have heard opponents of gun control invoke this argument. I do not recall having heard any gun control advocate respond to it. They ignore it. They pretend that no one has raised the question.

The voters accept this line of non-reasoning.

Gun control is like drug control: no one expects drug control to eliminate the use of illegal drugs. But voters do not want to admit that government control over drugs is a pipe dream. They take the same view on gun control. They don’t want to admit that the state’s intervention is making things worse for liberty. Liberty therefore must be sacrificed. The state must be said to have the power to control activities that the public privately accepts but publicly feels compelled to oppose.

I will re-write Sowell’s statement.

“Does anyone seriously believe that people who are prepared to defy the laws against smoking marijuana are going to obey laws against the use of cigarette paper to roll their own joints?”

Defenders of drug laws — who are very often opponents of gun control — respond to this question in the same way that defenders of gun control respond to Sowell’s other question.

Results: more laws, more government intrusion, larger budgets for bureaucrats, less liberty, and more play-pretend argumentation.

Basically, it boils down to this. Drug dealers are not going to obey laws that supposedly control guns.

If you think this argument makes no sense, then don’t expect liberals to respond to this argument: “People who are prepared to defy the laws against murder aren’t going to obey laws against owning guns or large-capacity magazines.”

Did you ever think about the chronology of drug laws in America? They parallel the licensing of physicians, which created a high-income cartel, which is justified on this basis: “We don’t want the general public to be able to buy drugs. So, we need state licensing of physicians to write prescriptions.”

It’s all about cartels. If you want to promote the creation of a high-income cartel, it’s easy. Get the state to outlaw something that most people want, and then license a group of specialists to sell it. This will also lead to the creation of an unlicensed, outlawed cartel, which also sells the item. That second cartel buys guns to defend its turf. The first cartel gets people with badges to buy guns to defend its turf.

Cartels want above-market income on state-protected turf. This takes guns. The debate is over who gets to carry the guns legally, and who will carry them illegally.

214174,"As a gun owner on a tight budget, I suffer the dilemma of either buying a ""new"" used gun, upgrading my current ones, or having enough cash to buy ammo. Being the thrifty person I am (translated mistakenly as ""Cheapskate"" by the wife), I often resort to creative alternatives when feeling necessity’s sharp pinch. The most recent challenge was to inexpensively upgrade the iron sights on my firearms to improve my ""broadside of a barn"" shooting ability to the modest goal of hitting within the black on a consistent basis. Purchasing new sights and paying for a gunsmith to install them was not a viable option with my present cash flow. A DIY project was in order.

I first tried painting dots on my gun’s sights. I found myself less than satisfied with the results. My clumsy artistry spoiled the aesthetics of my guns. After mulling about it, I came up with a better method.

You’ll need the following materials:

A 1/16″ hole punch. These can be purchased in craft stores.

Bright colored florescent labels with a coated finish.

Round toothpicks

Superglue

Acrylic floor polish.

floor polish. Cheap hobby brush (Not pictured, but you know what they look like)

Punch out a lot of holes from the desired colored label. I like bright green myself. Open the bottom jaw of the punch and pull out the round punched dots. Between static electricity and residue glue from the label, these can be a bit tricky to extract. Lay them on a white piece of paper to make them be easy to see.

Separate the white backing from the punched-out dot by sliding it off using a toothpick. Pick up a colored dot with the tip of the toothpick. If you have trouble picking up it up, roll the tip of the toothpick on your tongue. Spit makes a great temporary bond to hold the tiny dot on the toothpick.

With another toothpick, apply a tiny spot of superglue on the iron sight where the dot will be placed. Don’t rush — It will take a good 2—3 minutes for the glue to dry, plenty enough time to apply the dot. If you have too much glue on the sight, use the corner of an index card to soak up the excess. Careful not to glue the card to the sight! Put the dot on the glue spot. Until the glue dries, you’ll have enough time to slide the dot into position. The goal is to align the dots on either side of the ""V"" slot evenly.

Wait until the dots on the glue completely dry. Get the hobby brush and paint floor polish over the dots with a thin coat. Don’t gloop it on. Repeat with several more thin coats, letting each application dry in between. Acrylic polish is pretty tough stuff — it will help preserve the dots from wear and tear.

Here’s the end result for my Ruger MK II:

Neat, no? I first experimented with dots on my .22 H&R Sportsman’s 999 break-top revolver. They held up fine after thousands of rounds. The same went for my Ruger. I recently put dots on my Star PD, SKS, and several others with positive results. For my S&W Model 10, instead of a dot, I cut a thin strip and applied it to the ramp of the front sight. Works great. Looks good too.

Forget about using fluorescent paint. I never found the results worth the effort. This inexpensive trick will never replace the quality of Tritium or fiber optic sights, but for casual shooting I find it a great improvement over hand-painted efforts.

223767,"Recently by Gary North: Two Years of Gridlock

I am perceived by many readers as a pessimist. I am not a pessimist. I am an optimist beyond your wildest imagination. I am an eschatological postmillennialist. There are not many of us. I am also a believer in the free market social order — not just in its superiority in theory, but in its inevitable triumph in history. I believe that Leonard E. Read’s book title is correct: Then Truth Will Out.

I am not an optimist with respect to the pathway between here and there. Big Brother lurks in the state-maintained shrubbery of the pathway.

When a pride of lions is waiting patiently in the tall grass for zebras, some zebras are going to get eaten. When we think “bureaucrats,” we should think “lions.” We are zebras.

There will be losses. But the lions are getting old. They don’t run as fast these days. Zebras are multiplying. Think “China.” Think “Russia.” Then think back to Mao and Stalin. If those two concentration camps could collapse without armed resistance or a lost war, don’t tell me about the inevitability of tyranny.

Lincoln Steffens visited the Soviet Union in 1921 and returned to say, “I have been over into the future, and it works.” No, it didn’t. Neither do the mini-despotisms of the various Keynesian utopias. Their employees will not receive those pensions after all.

THE LITERARY DYSTOPIAS

Our thinking regarding the modern police states has been shaped by literary masterpieces. The most famous ones are 1984, written by an anti-Communist socialist, and Animal Farm, also written by him, and Brave New World, written by the socialist’s French instructor at Eton: Aldous Huxley.

There is a far better novel about the police state: That Hideous Strength: A Fairy Tale for Grown-ups. It was published in 1945. C. S. Lewis wrote it. I commend it to you. I re-read it every few years — one of two novels I re-read. (The other is Good Omens.) I first read it in the spring of 1964, beginning about four months after the deaths of Lewis, Huxley, and Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Lewis saw where we were headed in 1945. He also saw how it would end: the scattering of the empire-builders.

The positive utopias of the good society in literature were utopias of centrally planned states. No one has written them in a century. The dystopias are also centrally planned states. They reflect modern men’s declining faith in the healing powers of science as implemented by the state.

The power of science is seen as unstoppable. In the hands of bureaucrats, the tool of science produces a social order without liberty. The state’s controls may be justified as rational and therapeutic, but the system is tyrannical. This is the vision of the dystopias.

In Brave New World, the tool of control is a drug: soma. It keeps the masses docile. In 1984, it is two-way television. There is no privacy. In Animal Farm, it is widespread belief in the good of the whole, which mandates individual sacrifice. The results are the same: an elite maintains control over the masses. There is no way out.

The authors were not free market economists. The free market economist finds it difficult to believe that a system of centralized economic planning could ever gain access to resources sufficient to hold the masses together. The failures of the Soviet Union and Communist China stand as tombstones. They mark the inability of central planning to achieve its goals or the goals of the planning elite. Or, as the saying goes, money talks.

In 1978, Deng Xioping got capitalist religion. He announced the freeing up of agriculture, which has always been the weak link of socialism. In 1979, the Chinese economy started to grow.

In 1980, Moscow hosted the Olympics. From all over the world, Westerners came to see the show. The Soviet leaders saw for the first time how rich the West was, and how poor they were by comparison. They saw with their own eyes — first with amazement, then with horror — what the West had known for 60 years: they all dressed like Russian bureaucrats. They never recovered psychologically. Within a decade, the Soviet economy was broke. Hope had finally departed from the elite. It had departed from the masses decades earlier.

The elite publicly abandoned the system. Money talks.

It still talks.

SOCIALIST ECONOMIC CALCULATION

In 1920, Ludwig von Mises wrote a short essay, “Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth.”

He argued that socialist economic planning is inherently blind. Without free market prices that are based on private ownership, the government’s central planners have no way of knowing where to allocate scarce resources. This is especially true of capital goods. The planners are forced to copy prices in the non-socialist societies. This was his theory. It turned out to be correct in practice.

The socialists rejected this argument for seven decades. But, socialist experiment by experiment, Mises was proven correct. Of course, he argued that economic logic is the basis of economic proof, not historical data. But he was never taken seriously on this point by his critics or even most of his fans. The endless failures of Communist central planning to make anyone rich, including the Communist elite, finally got too much for the Communist elites to tolerate.

This brings me to the central thesis of my article. It is best expressed in three questions.

1. What is the value of suppressing a political deviant?

2. What is the cost?

3. Is the benefit greater than the cost?

Assume that you

are Big Brother. You can monitor anyone. You can find out what he

owns, what he earns, where he lives, where he works, what credit cards

he uses. You have a database on him. Any information that your database

lacks can be bought from private database companies.

If you can monitor anyone, you can target anyone. You can bankrupt almost anyone. Just bring a lawsuit against him. His legal bills will bust him. He knows this. He will capitulate. Money talks.

Do you want to set a legal precedent? Target someone with limited financial resources and no connections.

Scholars and journalists who are committed to a defense of individual liberty have collected databases of horror stories on coercive yet legal government invasions of privacy. For every documented story, there are untold numbers of similar stories that never reached the media.

As surely as the zebras know that there are lions out there, so do citizens know that there are bureaucrats out there. Some of these bureaucrats have access to databases.

We all are impressed how fast NCIS agent McGee can find out almost anything on any suspect, just by sitting at his computer and typing. We all know that the bad guys will not get away.

The problem is, in the real world, the bad guys often get away until they finally confess. Think “Bernard Madoff.” Furthermore, the good guys sometimes get nailed for something they never did.

The Madoff case is classic. All that government regulation, so little awareness! The reports got filed on time. The SEC was tipped off to chicanery. Yet nothing was done. Why not?

Mises told us why not. The government does not know how to price anything rationally. It cannot determine which cases are worth pursuing and which are not. There are no official guidelines that provide insight.

Here is the operational rule. Bureaucrats pursue those cases that justify their continuing employment. This goal includes the survival of their bureaucracies.

Civil Service laws protect most Federal employees. Bureaucratic immunity from budget cuts protects the bureaucracies. So, bureaucrats pick the easy targets in the same way that lions pick zebras: the young, the old, and the sick.

I once read an article about a jet fighter ace in the Korean War. He revealed his secret of success. He would rapidly survey a squadron of MIG-15s, looking for a plane that looked a little wobbly. If he spotted one, he knew the pilot was inexperienced. He went after that plane.

This strategy can make you an ace. It will not win wars. The Korean War ended in a cease-fire. It is still officially going on.

THE SPONTANEOUS SOCIAL ORDER

F. A. Hayek’s greatest intellectual contribution was not The Road to Serfdom (1944). It was the article published the next year: “The Use of Knowledge in Society.""

He argued that the amount of decentralized and highly specialized knowledge in society is enormous when compared to the knowledge available to a government committee. This should be obvious to anyone. What was not obvious to Western intellectuals was his conclusion: government planning is unable to match the efficiency of individual planning in a free market society.

This is a variation on Mises’s argument. Hayek emphasized the free market’s system of profit and loss. It elicits information from individuals who would not otherwise provide it or put it to socially positive uses. A planning board cannot get their collective hands on this information, he argued. Mises had emphasized that, even if the committee could get its hands on it, the committee would not know what to do with it. It could not put this information to its highest use.

The question then arises: Can a committee put this information to good use for the committee? Can its members feather their own nests? Can it achieve results that are sufficiently beneficial to the committee and those leaders it serves, so as to make irrelevant the fact that the committee cannot solve the allocation problem for the masses? In short, can the committee find a positive answer to the universal question: “What’s in it for me?”

The results of all but two of the Communist economic schemes in the twentieth century was “no.” The two exceptions were North Korea and Cuba. So far, these two systems remain Communist. But it is looking more and more as though this will end sometime in the next decade. Poverty in those two countries is overwhelming.

The only way for the rulers to keep this information from the masses is control over information. North Korea is better at this than Cuba is. It is also a poorer nation. We are back to the Austrian economists’ analysis of the shortage of reliable information.

To run a really successful tyranny, the leaders must have increasing wealth as well as more reliable data. They need wealth to hire the programmers, the data collectors, and the police. Computer costs keep falling, but they fall much faster in the private sector (microcomputers) than the government sector (mainframes).

The government’s computer systems are not integrated. Not even the Internal Revenue Service has a seamless system. (The two greatest lies in computer marketing are these: “seamless transfer of data” and “user-friendly."")

Yes, governments have access to ever-growing quantities of data. But the public has far greater access to low-cost information that it uses to increase the overall complexity of society. The task of monitoring what is going on becomes ever-more utopian. The government is always falling behind, for the reasons Hayek described. The greater the complexity of society, the less able the State is to monitor it, assess it, and use the data to control it.

SOCIETY VS. THE STATE

Society is not the State. Society is a complex social order which is based on voluntary exchange. The State is an institution that imposes coercion. The State’s budget constitutes a large section of every modern society, but the inefficiency of the State is legendary. The State cannot get much accomplished. Why not? Because its employees are rewarded for following the book. They are not rewarded for innovation. Mises made this point clear in his 1944 book, Bureaucracy. The State’s system of funding is different from the free market’s system.

The free market rewards successful forecasting to meet the demands of customers. It is future-oriented: meeting future customers’ demand. Society advances through innovation and capital formation. It advances because of a system of profit and loss. Successful innovators get very rich. Unsuccessful ones lose control over resources.

The successful bureaucrat advances up the chain of command by not making a big mistake. The essence of bureaucracy is risk-avoidance. It is slow. It is self-consciously slow. It is defensive. It is always looking up regulations. Its answer to every request is “no.” Why? Because you can retreat from “no” to “yes” if you have to, and no one gets upset. You cannot avoid trouble by moving from “yes” to “no.”

One implication of all this should be obvious, but it isn’t: the State is rapidly falling behind in its ability to control the economy. That was Mises’s insight in 1920. Libertarians and free market conservatives believe this in general, but they do not believe it specifically. They give the State more credit for its ability to extend its power than they should.

Think of Geithner and Bernanke. They are frantically trying to restore the rate of economic growth. Nothing is working. The economy is clearly broken. The banking system is in retrenchment mode. Bankers know their banks’ balance sheets are held together with phony numbers. They refuse to lend.

On October 25, Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, gave a speech in which he admitted the following: “Of the many ways of organising banking, the worst is the one we have today” (p. 18). Thanks, Merv, for putting it so well! Now please forward a copy to Ben.

What is true of the government’s ability to control the economy is equally true of its ability to control political resistance. The Tea Party is creating a threat to the Old Boy Network. It is the handwriting on the wall. Voters are beginning to rebel. They are not playing by the traditional rules.

The ability of the Establishment to maintain its power is dependent on its being able to buy off the voters and co-opt the newly elected representatives. The failure of the economy reduces the Establishment’s ability to hold onto power.

The police State is going bankrupt. It has issued more promises to voters and more promises to pay investors in Treasury debt than it can possibly fulfill. When it goes belly-up, as the USSR did, and as Red China did, the Keynesian system will be exposed as the little man behind the curtain — with a badge, a gun, and a printing press.

A determined herd of zebras can outrun any pride of lions. Eventually, lions will be too weak to run.

Zebras don’t need to kick lions to death. They merely need to run fast.

CONCLUSION

The police State is doomed. It cannot possibly keep up with the constant innovation of society. It cannot gain access to enough resources to maintain control. It wastes the resources it commandeers.

The free market is winning. The attempts of the Federal Reserve and Congress to delay the readjustment of capital pricing goes on, but these attempts are not bringing the promised recovery.

The voters are growing restless. They have been promised miracles by the politicians. These promises are visibly disintegrating. We are seeing a loss of faith.

The key to government control is voluntary compliance. Without self-government, the civil government cannot exercise control. Self-government relies on widespread trust far more than widespread fear.

Widespread trust is fading. Widespread fear will fade with it.

The little men behind the various curtains are getting exposed on YouTube. There is nothing they can do about this.

Familiarity breeds contempt. It can’t happen fast enough for me.

373693,"The number one question I am asked by new readers is “where do I start?”. This is followed by a meekcomment indicating “I have a job and a family and can not afford to move to a farm in the outback.”

Well first of all, let me say that no apologies are needed. None. Moving to a farm or even to the remote boonies is not for everyone, myself included. On the other hand, with some time, perseverance and a bit of hard work, we all can take steps to be self sufficient. And isn’t that what prepping is all about: being self sufficient so we can take care of our own needs no matter what?

In an idealized world, we would be 100% self-sufficient. Alas, that is unrealistic for most of us and is something that is simply is not going to happen for most of us, desire notwithstanding. I am just being honest and pragmatic here because honestly, that is the truth,

That does not mean that we can not have the ability to get by nicely on our own and satisfy 80% or more of our needs without outside help. I am just saying that to set a goal of 100% self sufficiency is defeatist and a goal that is so difficult that giving up is likely.

Going back to that idealized world, if everything were perfect, we would have enough food, water, power, fuel, and money to live a well-rounded, healthy and comfortable life. Hard work would be the norm but at the end of the day we would have the satisfaction of being able to take care of ourselves without selling out to greedsters or taking a handout from the government.

Alas, everywhere you look there are roadblocks to achieving this state. Not the least of these roadblocks is our dependency on transportation systems and the power infrastructure to deliver goods and energy products to our homes. We depend on the government and insurance companies to rescue us if there is a natural disaster and we depend on organized medicine to keep us healthy.

The issue with these dependencies, of course, is that they may be unreliable, out of control or so fragile that a strong wind(or hurricane or earthquake) will shut them down, perhaps with dire consequences. If you are smart enough to recognize this, you will strive for self sufficiency of one type or another.

Mapping a Road to Self-Sufficiency

Luckily, self-sufficiency is not an all or nothing proposition. At one end of the spectrum is a total, off grid, agrarian lifestyle and at the other is a moderately self-sufficient lifestyle where steps are taken to move toward 20% to 50% self sufficiency.

Today I will share some easy steps you can take to to start becoming self-sufficient. These are steps that do not require a farm, do not require acreage and do not require a lot of money. They are practical steps that you can select from and embrace as your needs and desire for independence evolve over time.

Some are easy and others take a bit of skill and practice. Some can be done for little or no cost and others will require an investment in time, labor, money or all three. The good news is that there are lots of choices and the journey toward self sufficiency does not have to be done in a day, a month, a year or even a decade.

19 Baby Steps Toward a Self Sufficient Lifestyle

1. Build up a emergency food supply

Stuff happens but you still have to eat. Start by building up a cupboard full of food. Although my method is a bit unconventional, I endorse filling up a cupboard or pantry with essentials that are hearty enough to fill bellies for a week, a month or longer without regard to the exact number of meals and the precise number of calories. Trust me, by following the guidelines in 20 Items to Kick Start Your Food Storage Plan, you will have more emergency food than 95% of your friends and neighbors.

2. Learn to cook without electricity or gas

There are numerous options to cooking on a traditional stove. Build or buy a rocket stove that only requires biomass for fuel. Learn to use it while cooking a variety of food items. Also consider a propane stove; just make sure that you also stockpile extra propane tanks.

3. Know how to build and start a fire

Just because you live in the city and have electricity does not mean you will never have to build a fire. Learn how to build a fire and keep it lit for an extended period. Collect biomass, dryer lint and other materials that can be used as tinder to help get a fire going then practice starting a fire without the benefit of matches or a lighter. A good resource for learning how to build a fire is Catching Fire: 21 Failsafe Fire-starting Methods.

4. Install an alternate fuel source

You might be surprised by how little power you need to get by. Start with an inexpensive portable generator or some solar panels. Also think about those items that must have power when the grid is down, such as a well, medical devices and refrigeration. Take care of providing power to those things and let the rest go for now.

5. Grow a vegetable garden

This is a great first step to take toward taking care of yourself and some of your food needs. There are some books to help you such as the All New Square Foot Gardening plus you can get tons of help from seed suppliers, Master Gardeners and friendly neighbors that will be glad to give you some regionally appropriate advice.

6. Start a compost pile

Something many gardeners do not think about is that to be successful, they are going to need fertilizer for their crops. Instead of creating a dependency on the garden center and chemical fertilizers (which also cost money), create your own fertilizer from food scraps and yard waste. The end result will be a nutrient rich fertilizer that is not only free, but a form of “black gold” for your garden vegetables.

7. Grow fruit trees and berries

Imagine growing hundreds of pounds of fruit each year literally for free and for very little work? This can be done if you take the time, by asking around, to seek out native fruit trees that are natural to your area. Once established, these trees will not require fertilizer or water (but if you want to feed them some of that compost, they will love it).

8. Learn to preserve your bounty

Canning, freezing, drying and smoking are some of the ways your can preserve your bounty so that you will have it to feed your family during the off-season. It does take time, yes, but the results in terms of food-saving costs are worth it. As with gardening, once you get the hang of it, preserving your food can be fun as well.

9. Take a first aid course and create a well-stocked first aid kit

Whether you take a course or not, you will need a well-stocked first aid kit. In addition, you should have at least one printed medical reference such as The Survival Medicine Handbook or The Merck Manual Home Health Handbook .

10. Take charge of your health

Do not wait until you are sick and desperate before learning how to take care of your own health needs. Study how healing herbs and essential oils can resolve minor first aid and health annoyances (such as scrapes, insect bites, chest congestion due to a cold or the flu) and practice using these methods in daily life.

372245,"Have you ever been at a shooting range where other people are acting in an unsafe manner? What did you do? Was it something you’d do again today or do you think you could have handled it better? Unsafe practices happen more often at shooting ranges than some of you may think they do.

A while back I wrote a piece about knowing your gun before going to the range. The incident that inspired the article involved two couples who didn’t seem to know anything about the guns they were shooting, and on top of that they didn’t seem to want any help either. Needless to say it was a somewhat freightening situation, and ultimately my wife and I left.

The article sparked a little debate about individual responsibility and the appropriate reaction. Today we hope to explore appropriate avenues for dealing with potentially dangerous situations at a range.

You can leave

Of course, it’s always within your rights to just pack up and get out of Dodge if you feel something is unsafe at the range. Some outdoor ranges have little or no supervision or staff available to stop potential tomfoolery. If you feel the best thing to do is just to remove yourself from the situation, then do so, because there’s no reason to stick around and risk injury. After all, we aren’t dealing with someone holding a pool cue incorrectly at the next table; we are dealing with someone who is potentially misusing a gun.

You can educate

If you want to educate people about what they are doing dangerously wrong, you of course have that option, too, but keep in mind that they might not want it. In a situation with no range master, it could be up to all of us to step in and help. If approached correctly, a receptive person will likely listen to a more experienced shooter. The reality, though, is that it may embarrass them and cause unnecessary problems on top of the already obvious ones.

Remember that tone and attitude go along way when giving instruction – this goes back to the Golden Rule. Try to respond appropriately and a person will be receptive to the information.

Report them

If you find yourself at a range with staff present, I would consider immediately dropping whatever you were doing and notifying appropriate personnel of a potentially dangerous situation. It isn’t considered tattletale behavior if people can reasonably be killed due to someone’s neglect. Don’t think twice about notifying those in charge if you see something outrageous at the shooting range.

In addition to that, the rules at every single professional range that I’ve been to prefers that the staff help instead of a fellow patron. In their house, it’s their responsibility to enforce safety. Your job is just to be safe.

187065,"Welfare for the Left, Welfare for the Right, Welfare for the World

by Rep. Ron Paul, MD

u201CThe President, a Republican no less, seems to believe that government should be telling us what kind of car to drive, what kind of education our kids should receive, how to cure disease in Africa and the Caribbean, how to liberate women the world over, how to fund technological innovation, and even how to u2018transform our souls’ and lift the u2018hopes of all mankind’ — all courtesy of the long-suffering taxpayer who is, once again, supposed to believe that the government can make better use of his money than he can.u201D

~ Lew Rockwell Jr., President of the Mises Institute

The State of the Union speech delivered last week showed little enthusiasm for the kind of real spending cuts our nation so desperately needs. Instead, it outlined a federal budget that grows at a rate of 5 to 7 percent each year, and in the twilight zone of Washington this is deemed to show spending restraint! Much of this lack of restraint will take the form of good old-fashioned welfare, whether for liberal social causes or conservative corporate causes.

Consider the call for hydrogen-powered cars. The administration wants to spend more than $$1.2 billion tax dollars promoting hydrogen research. This is hailed as forward-thinking environmentally friendly policy, but really it’s just corporate welfare. No one considers that certain companies and lobbyists will benefit handsomely from this new government spending, or that American taxpayers might prefer to keep the money for themselves. If companies in the hydrogen industry get a billion dollars, what about other industries? Why should government favor one industry or technology, and who in government is qualified to choose?

A better approach would be to follow the Constitution and stop spending tax dollars on corporate subsidies. Private sector research always works better than government-sponsored research, and it always produces more honest results. If hydrogen power really works well, and companies can profitably provide clean running, affordable cars that people like, then the market for such cars will be tremendous. In other words, if hydrogen cars are so great, they will become popular without government subsidies. Why should the technology be developed at taxpayer expense, when future profits will be reaped by private companies? Let the market, rather than the lobbyists, decide whether hydrogen-powered cars are the future.

The administration also wants to spend a whopping $$15 billion in Africa to fight AIDS. Again, this is praised as compassionate and progressive policy. But what about the people who are suffering here at home, whether from AIDS or other diseases, poverty, or unemployment? Of course there is absolutely no constitutional authority to send tax dollars overseas. It is unconscionable to tax Americans, especially poor Americans, to supposedly alleviate suffering in other countries.

I say u201Csupposedlyu201D because the money never really helps, and almost always ends up in the hands of dictators, corrupt government officials, or thuggish leaders of local factions. We could send $$100 or $$500 billion, and Africa would remain mired in AIDS and poverty. Only freedom, property rights, capitalism, and the rule of law can help Africa. The AIDS crisis cannot be solved by government, but rather requires a combination of truly independent private sector medical research and politically incorrect prevention efforts. Americans are the most charitable people on earth, and we should stop taxing them so much and allow private charities, including charities aimed at combating AIDS, to flourish.

The State of the Union speech provided stark evidence that the era of big government is hardly over, and that welfare has not been reformed. Hydrogen boondoggles and AIDS industry welfare are just two small examples, symbols of what is wrong with a federal government that spends 2.4 trillion dollars in a single year. Not only does government spend far too much of your money, it spends the money badly. Once we as a society accepted the notion that Congress could fund programs not authorized in the Constitution, the sky was the limit — and we’ve reached that limit today.

743705,"Timothy Geithner’s plan to save the big banks will be a success. This success will come at a cost. The plan will hurt taxpayers, and it will lead to severe price inflation. It will not revive the faltering economy in 2009. It will not restore the housing market. Family wealth will continue to decline.

I worry a bit about my assessment. It is shared by Keynesian economists Paul Krugman and James Galbraith. Still, I am sticking to my guns.

Galbraith was unsparing in his criticisms. The Geithner plan gets toxic assets off the big banks’ books, but it does not make them any less toxic. Because the FDIC is insuring most of these assets against loss, the taxpayers will probably wind up paying the freight. You can see the two-part TV interview with him here.

http://www.garynorth.com/snip/811.htm

http://www.garynorth.com/snip/812.htm

Galbraith calls the banking system “massively corrupted.” I am in complete agreement.

The political issue was this, he says: “Which banks will go under?” The government does not want to face this fact: the large banks are the culprits. I agree completely. This is a big bank bailout.

Paul Krugman also gave his two cents’ worth. This appears on his blog on the New York Times (March 23). Leave on one side the question of whether the Geithner plan is a good idea or not. One thing is clearly false in the way it’s being presented: administration officials keep saying that there’s no subsidy involved, that investors would share in the downside. That’s just wrong. Why? Because of the non-recourse loans, which reportedly will finance 85 percent of the asset purchases.

Non-recourse loans are what investors love. If the asset goes bad, the FDIC will pick up most of the tab.

Oh, say can you see, by the dawn’s early light? I hope the light is dawning for you.

Krugman in another column calls this a replay of Japan’s zombie banks of the 1990—2005 era. The Obama administration is now completely wedded to the idea that there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with the financial system — that what we’re facing is the equivalent of a run on an essentially sound bank.

It’s not just the Administration that sees it this way. It was also mutual fund investors on Monday. To this end the plan proposes to create funds in which private investors put in a small amount of their own money, and in return get large, non-recourse loans from the taxpayer, with which to buy bad — I mean misunderstood — assets. This is supposed to lead to fair prices because the funds will engage in competitive bidding.

But it is immediately obvious, if you think about it, that these funds will have skewed incentives. In effect, Treasury will be creating — deliberately! — the functional equivalent of Texas S&Ls in the 1980s: financial operations with very little capital but lots of government-guaranteed liabilities. For the private investors, this is an open invitation to play heads I win, tails the taxpayers lose. So sure, these investors will be ready to pay high prices for toxic waste. After all, the stuff might be worth something; and if it isn’t, that’s someone else’s problem.

That someone else, of course, is the taxpayer. The taxpayer will get nailed in this deal.

Krugman made this prediction: “I fear that when the plan fails, as it almost surely will, the administration will have shot its bolt: it won’t be able to come back to Congress for a plan that might actually work.”

This is one more move toward the nationalization of the capital markets. It is a way to postpone the day of reckoning. It is a way to let the FDIC get off the hook for bailing out a major bank. The FDIC prefers to swallow the hemlock later. The losses on the toxic assets, worst case, will be less than having to take over a large bank and administer the sale of that bank between Friday afternoon and Monday morning.

CHEERING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DOLLAR

Unless American businesses reverse the present slide of profits, there will be no economic recovery.

Until there is economic recovery, the stock market will not be able to sustain its recent upward move, which has come only because the Federal Reserve last week promised to create $$1.2 trillion in fiat money, and the Treasury has now promised to offer half a trillion dollars’ worth of leveraged grants if investors buy the banks’ toxic assets. If this isn’t enough money, it will later offer another half trillion.

How will the plan work? The banks will get off the hook 100%. This is the central fact. The FDIC will guarantee the packages of loans sold by banks. That means Congress will guarantee it. A bill introduced by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd seeks a $$500 billion line of credit from Congress. The FDIC will get what it asks in a crisis.

The FDIC will allow highly leveraged guarantees of up to 6 to 1. That takes most of the risk out of the deal for investors. Taxpayers will foot the bill if there are losses. Then these packages of loans will be auctioned off to investors. The investors can borrow up to 50% of their investment money from the Treasury. You think I’m exaggerating? Here is the official press release. . . . To start the process, banks will decide which assets — usually a pool of loans — they would like to sell. The FDIC will conduct an analysis to determine the amount of funding it is willing to guarantee. Leverage will not exceed a 6-to-1 debt-to-equity ratio. Assets eligible for purchase will be determined by the participating banks, their primary regulators, the FDIC and Treasury. Financial institutions of all sizes will be eligible to sell assets.

Pools Are Auctioned Off to the Highest Bidder: The FDIC will conduct an auction for these pools of loans. The highest bidder will have access to the Public-Private Investment Program to fund 50 percent of the equity requirement of their purchase.

Financing Is Provided Through FDIC Guarantee: If the seller accepts the purchase price, the buyer would receive financing by issuing debt guaranteed by the FDIC. The FDIC-guaranteed debt would be collateralized by the purchased assets and the FDIC would receive a fee in return for its guarantee.

Private Sector Partners Manage the Assets: Once the assets have been sold, private fund managers will control and manage the assets until final liquidation, subject to strict FDIC oversight.

Investors on Monday cheered the prospects of the destruction of the dollar and the bankruptcy of the government. They drove up the Dow by almost 500 points.

The “new economics” of the Bernanke era (since September 2008) is based on one gigantic bailout after another, either by the Federal Reserve or the Treasury. It also rests on a perpetual bailout offered by the People’s Bank of China. The PBOC is expected to create new yuans (inflationary), use these newly created yuan to buy U.S. dollars, and then use these dollars to buy U.S. Treasury debt, enabling the Treasury to fund its rapidly escalating debt at T-bill interest rates no higher than 0.25% per annum.

How realistic are these assumptions? Not very. Yet they are the foundation of the investors’ recent hope of a new bull market in stocks.

The rise in the stock market has been based on short-run factors that will inevitably undermine the profitability of U.S. businesses. Businesses need a currency unit that is predictable. For long-term profitability, interest rates must reflect the underlying conditions of supply and demand: supply and demand for capital, not supply and demand for digits called money. Digits do not make workers more productive. Capital does. Capital must come from investors who forego consumption in order to lend money to businesses, or else provide capital through the purchase of shares.

EARNINGS ARE FALLING

In the fourth quarter of 2008, earnings (profits) for the S&P 500 went negative. This has not happened before. At least 400 of the 500 firms had losses.

For six quarters, the S&P 500 had declining earnings. The sixth quarter culminated in an actual loss. “This is the worst; after the sixth quarter of negative growth, it will be the first quarter ever of negative earnings,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst, at Standard & Poor’s.

A sixth quarter of negative growth ties the prior record set when Harry Truman was president, running from the first quarter of 1951 to the second quarter of 1952.

“Next quarter, we’re expecting a new record of seven quarters of negative growth,” Silverblatt added.

Where is there legitimate hope of turning around this economy? Investors these days trust only the U.S. government.

The government must then decide what investments to make. Investments are usually defined by politicians as government spending on government-owned projects: roads, canals, and government buildings. Sometimes, a government welfare project is described as an investment.

The government can subsidize a limited segment of the economy. Today, almost all of the government’s bailout money is going to two sectors: the government-owned mortgage market and the banks that lent money on residential real estate. Despite the bailouts, the residential real estate market continues to decline. The commercial real estate market is now beginning to decline.

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE

Local banks have invested heavily in this sector of the economy. Before the end of 2009, the losses on commercial real estate will begin to catch up with the losses in residential real estate.

The National Association of Realtors, usually a source of optimistic reports, said in February that the outlook is grim. The Commercial Leading Indicator for Brokerage Activity fell 6.0 percent to an index of 109.2 in the fourth quarter from a downwardly revised reading of 116.1 in the third quarter, and is 9.1 percent lower than an index of 120 in the fourth quarter of 2007. NAR’s track of the commercial leading indicator dates back to 1990.

The NAR report indicates declining real estate activity for at least six to nine more months. The NAR is not alone. The Society of Industrial and Office Realtors, in its SIOR Commercial Real Estate Index, a separate attitudinal survey of 644 local market experts, also expects a lower level of business activity in upcoming quarters. Ninety percent of respondents indicate leasing activity in their market is down, and vacancy rates are generally higher.

The SIOR index has declined for eight consecutive quarters and is 58.5 percentage points below the 100 point criteria that represents a balanced marketplace.

Losses in the job market are depressing commercial real estate. These losses show no sign of abating.

Vacancy rates in the office market are expected to approach 17%, up from a little over 13% in late 2008. Industrial vacancy rates are expected to exceed 12% in the third quarter, up from 10.7% in the third quarter of 2008. The retail market is also falling. Rents are expected to fall by 9% this year. They fell by 2% in 2008. This indicates contraction across the board.

The standard estimate for unemployment by the end of the year is 9%. Some forecasters, myself included, think it will exceed 10% in 2010. Unemployment creates fear in the minds of the still employed. They will move toward reduced spending on non-essential consumer goods. This will force retailers to cut back. The pressure on commercial real estate will accelerate in 2009. This will put additional pressure on commercial real estate.

DIGITS ARE NOT WEALTH

The bailouts are restoring the balance sheets of the big banks by taking bad debt off these balance sheets. These debts are being transferred to taxpayers. These are trillion-dollar subsidies to the largest banks.

Investors in stocks assume that these subsidies to the narrow financial sector will solve the problems facing the banks. This assumes that all of the bad loans have been registered. This is not the case. The fact that the worst of the subprime crisis is behind us is irrelevant. The re-sets of Alt-A mortgages and option adjustable rate mortgages will continue to escalate through 2011.

There will have to be additional purchases of toxic assets by the Treasury. The FED will have to exchange additional Treasury debt assets for bad mortgages if there is not going to be a replay of the last six months. One of the reasons why the FED is trying to push down 30-year mortgage rates by buying Freddie and Fannie debt ($$500 billion) is to make possible the rollovers of the Alt-A mortgages and option adjustable mortgages. The problem will be the credit worthiness of the signers of these loans. Rates are low, but only for solvent home buyers.

If the bailouts continue, as they will, at some point these large banks will stop holding money as excess reserves at the Federal Reserve at 0%. The stock market is anticipating this. What it is not anticipating is a return of fractional reserve money multiplication. What seems good to stock investors — banks returning to lending — is in fact the engine of inflation.

The size of the FED’s asset base has more than doubled over the 12 months, from about $$950 billion to over $$2.2 trillion.

This does not count the additional $$1.2 trillion dollars that Bernanke announced on March 18. This 3.6-to-one expansion of the monetary base will spread to M1 when banks finally start lending into the capital markets.

Just because the public has 3.6 times more money to spend does not mean that people will be 3.6 times richer. Bernanke has vowed that when the economy recovers, this $$1.2 trillion increase of funds will be reversed. That would take the FED’s balance sheet back to $$2.2 trillion: more than doubling the monetary base as of March 2008.

I think Galbraith is wrong about banks’ refusing to lend. I think they will lend as soon as the toxic assets are off their books. They will move assets from excess reserve category (0%) to a loan category, such as Treasury debt. When they do, the fractional reserve process will take over. The monetary base will be put to profitable use — profitable for the banks, disastrous for holders of dollars.

Americans have been set up for massive price inflation, all for the sake of bailing out Fannie and Freddie, two grossly mismanaged corporations, and bailing out the large banks that lent to companies that leveraged themselves 30-to-1 to profit from the real estate bubble created by the FED by way of Fannie and Freddie.

Digits are not wealth. More money in your bank account will not make you richer unless no one else has a comparable increase.

Wealth comes from deferred consumption. It does not come from increased consumption. The FED and the Treasury have subsidized consumption, not thrift. Theirs is an ersatz productivity, an illusion of wealth as reported by digits.

NEVER-ENDING BAILOUTS

The response of the FED and the Treasury has been to increase the national debt, increase the issuing of fiat money, and swapping toxic assets for AAA-rated T-bills at face value. All of this has put at risk the solvency of the government, the stability of the dollar, and the economic futures of most Americans.

The people in charge of policy-making have some vague understanding of cause and effect in monetary theory. They are money-managers. Paulson was an ex-CEO of Goldman Sachs. Geithner got his start with Kissinger & Associates. He went to the Treasury late in Reagan’s second term. Then he went to the Council on Foreign Relations as a senior fellow. Then he went to the International Momentary Fund (IMF). Then he became President of the New York FED. It is not possible that he does not understand the implications of Federal Reserve monetary policy. He helped set this policy and execute it.

We can expect a continuing series of monetary and fiscal interventions as the mortgage market continues to deteriorate, as housing prices continue to fall, as the credit card debt market continues to become burdened with unpaid debt, as Asian central banks reduce their purchase of Treasury debt, and as corporate bonds begin to fall because of rising prices and therefore rising long-term interest rates.

The promise of $$300 billion in FED purchases of 2-year to 10-year Treasury bonds did push down rates. The rate on 2-year bonds on March 17 was 1.05%. On March 20, it was .89%. The rate for 10-year bonds was at 3.02%. On March 20, it was 2.65. The reduction was less for 20-year and 30-year bonds. The FED’s promise to buy an extra $$300 billion is marginal in a market that must roll over $$11 trillion every three to four years.

The FED has one policy: inflation. The Treasury has one policy: deficits. The FED can dance with the Treasury by buying a portion of its deficit. I think the FED will buy an ever-increasing portion of this debt as it rolls over. The FED will try to keep down Treasury rates that would otherwise rise as a result of the departure of private investors from this market at today’s rates. This will not help corporate bonds, which will fall as a result of the FED’s selective subsidizing of the Treasury and the largest banks.

The bailouts serve as temporary subsidies for the stock market at every announcement. But then investors think through the implications of more fiat money and larger deficits. The stock market then falls back. The underlying pressure is downward because of falling earnings. The inflationary implications of the interlocked bailouts threaten the present structure of long-term interest rates.

Bailouts always come at the expense of the majority of taxpaying citizens. The FED and the Treasury can and do subsidize big banks. The biggest banks will be protected from bankruptcy by the existing political structure. But these narrow subsidies must be paid for. They will be paid for by four groups: those who buy and hold Treasury debt; those who buy and hold dollar-denominated assets; those who are dependent on fixed dollar income; and taxpayers in the higher brackets.

If you are a member of one or more of these groups, your future is at risk. Your dreams are being sacrificed by the money managers who enjoy operating in a nice cartel. They have gained the support of the senior decision-makers in the U.S. Treasury, which is staffed by representatives of the cartel.

CONCLUSION

Subsidies benefit those who are subsidized. The subsidies eventually result in repercussions in the broad economy that put at risk the economic recovery. Until the prices of capital assets in all stages of production are allowed to rise or fall in terms of stable money and the demand for capital, corporate earnings will remain low. They will fall. Falling earnings will undermine the bull market that investors hope for.

It is sad to see fund investors pour money short-term into the equity markets, despite the fact that corporate earnings have fallen and are expected to fall. The mutual fund market remains committed to the idea that investors can become rich by playing the greater-fool game. Expected future earnings are the basis of rational pricing of assets. If earnings fall, asset prices should also fall. Only a rising price/earnings ratio can keep this decline from happening. A rising price/earnings ratio was the essence of Greenspan’s stock market bubble, which ended in March 2000.

Are retirement fund investors willing to trust the FED to bring back the post-1991 stock market? Will they remain fully invested in stocks because they think that fiat money and the largest deficits in American history will bring back the NASDAQ’s P/E ratio in early 2000: 200 to 1?

Incredibly, if we use the TMT figure for earnings — twelve-month trailing earnings — the S&P 500 in today’s range will be 183 in the second quarter and 235 in the third.

I don’t think this is likely, which means either that reported earnings will rise dramatically or prices will fall dramatically.

Even in the

worst economic crisis since the 1930s, New York knows how to throw

a party. For most of yesterday hundreds of thousands of people made

a sea of green that paraded up Fifth Avenue to mark St Patricks

Day. Tens of thousands lined the street to watch them. The all-day

party, fuelled by imports of Guinness and whiskey, seemed the more

intensely engaged upon as an escape from omnipresent financial gloom.

Away from the

party, the mood in Americas cultural and business capital

is more firmly anchored in stark reality, and quite different from

the euphoria that pervaded it when I was last here, on election

day. President Obama still enjoys the popularity that comes with

not being George Bush, especially in a city top-heavy with Democrats.

But his initial response to the global calamity that he found on

entering the Oval Office has not inspired popularitys more

sober elder brother, confidence. Large constituencies, notably business,

are voicing their scepticism openly. The Presidents much-vaunted

$$787 billion stimulus package is being widely interpreted, even

by some of those (such as Warren Buffett, Americas second-richest

man) who openly supported Mr Obama for the presidency, as a serious

failure. And we are only just past the first 50 days.

Mr Obama is

lucky that his Republican opponents in Congress are disorganised,

incoherent and without ideas of their own. The White House branded

Rush Limbaugh, the populist talk radio host, leader of the opposition,

following an assault Limbaugh had made on the President's neo-socialist

policies. This remark was designed not just to humiliate elected

Republicans for their impotence, but also to attempt to terrify

the American public at the thought of a man widely seen as a demagogue

and an extremist leading a main political movement. It should worry

Mr Obama that while the former part of the strategy has hit home,

the latter hasn't.

372415,"One of the most common questions we get from members is how many points will a given violation add to their driving record. It’s an important question, but it’s not the only one to ask after you get a traffic ticket. You also need to know how many points it takes to trigger a license suspension.

The answers to both questions depend on what state you’re in. This is because different states use different systems for assessing points against your license, and some don’t use points at all.

Traffic violation points systems assign a certain number of points for each traffic citation based on the severity of the offense. If you’re convicted of that offense, the points go on your driving record. Accumulate enough points, and you will lose your license.

The number of points assigned per violation varies considerably from state to state, as does the threshold for suspension. In California, most violations only cost you one or two points, but you can lose your license if you accumulate four or more points over 12 months. In Wisconsin, speeding up to 10 mph over the speed limit will add three points to your record, and you will lose your license if you accumulate 12 points over a 12 month period. In Utah a speeding violation can run up to 75 points, but you won’t lose your license until you hit 300 points.

To make matters even more complicated, nine states (HI, KS, LA, MN, MS, OR, RI, WA, WY) don’t track points, but that doesn’t mean you’re off the hook if you get a ticket. They still monitor your driving behavior to determine if any action against your license is warranted. In the state of Washington, for example, if you’re ticketed for six moving violations over 12 months, you’ll lose your driver’s license for 60 days.

DMV for a nominal fee.

Points on your driving record can affect your insurance rates, but the relationship may not be as direct as you think. This is because insurance companies don’t necessarily pay close attention to DMV points. They instead use their own points/ratings systems to calculate rates and surcharges using data compiled from third-party sources. This explains why violations that don’t show up on your driving record, like photo-based tickets in most states, can still raise your insurance rates.

This last fact contradicts the frequently repeated statement from politicians, “safety” advocates and camera vendors that camera tickets won’t increase your insurance rates. The NMA refuted this in a prior newsletter, but it’s insightful to consider this chart from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety which lays out camera ticket penalties by state.

insurers.” This implies that they are used by insurers in other states. Look at Rhode Island, for example, where it states that red-light camera tickets are “not to be used by insurers until there is a final adjudication of the violation.”

So, what can you do to minimize the impact of points on your driving record and your insurance rates? Here are a few tips:

Learn how the point system in your state works. You can track that down on your state’s DMV website or start here.

Request a copy of your driving record from your DMV and from your insurance company.

Fight every ticket to the best of your ability.

If you don’t win a dismissal, try to negotiate down to a non-moving violation or see if you’re eligible to take a traffic safety course as a way to remove points from your record.

Check the language in your auto insurance policy which may spell out your carrier’s underwriting standards.

Call your insurance provider if you have questions about the impact a specific traffic citation will have on your rates.

469462,"As a kid, I was a big James Bond fan. Saw all the movies and read all the books. One thing I noticed about the book version of James Bond was that every time he took a shower, he would start off with the water nice and hot, and then turn it down to cold for the last few minutes. Perhaps this little detail of Bonds personal bathing regimen was a subtle way for Ian Flemming to illustrate Bonds Scottish ancestry, as this type of shower is commonly known as a Scottish Shower. Who knows.

Being an impressionable kid, I started doing it too. I didnt know the proper name for this type of shower, so I just called it the James Bond Shower. Taking a shower that started hot and ended cold proved to be quite invigorating. It woke me up and added a bit of pep to my step throughout the day. Ive continued the practice of the James Bond Shower into adulthood. Along the way, Ive discovered that cold water baths have been used for centuries as a way to treat various ailments and that modern studies lend credence to the health claims associated with this age old treatment.

Below we give a brief rundown on the benefits of the James Bond Shower.

The Art of Manliness: ... Brett McKay, Kate McKay Best Price: $$2.67 Buy New $$4.99 (as of 09:50 EST - Details)

A Brief History of Cold Water Therapy

James Bond wasnt the first to enjoy the benefits of a shot of cold water. In ancient times, hot water was a luxury. People had to live near a hot springs in order to enjoy the comfort of a hot bath, so for most of human history people bathed in cold water. But even when the Ancient Greeks developed heating systems for their public baths, they continued bathing in cold water for the health benefits.

The Spartans, hard-asses that they were, felt hot water was for the weak and unmanly. When they did take baths (which was, like, once a year) they used only cold water because they thought it tempered the body and made it vigorous for ass kicking.

During the first century, Finnish folks would sweat it out in saunas and then jump into an ice cold lake or stream, a pastime which is referred to as avantouinti or ice hole swimming and is still enjoyed by modern Finns and others wild and woolly Scandinavians.

Many cultures incorporated a cold water dousing into their religious ceremonies. Some Native American tribes would alternate between sitting in a sweat lodge and jumping into an icy river or snow bank. Ancient Russians also took frequent plunges into ice cold rivers for health and spiritual cleansing. Japanese practitioners of Shinto, both in ancient and modern times, would stand under an icy waterfall as part of a ritual known as Misogi, which was believed to cleanse the spirit.

In the 1820s, a German farmer named Vincenz Priessnitz started touting a new medical treatment called hydrotherapy, which used cold water to cure everything from broken bones to erectile dysfunction. He turned his familys homestead into a sanitarium, and patients flocked to it in the hope that his cold water cure could help them. Among his clientele were dukes, duchesses, counts, countesses, and a few princesses to boot.

Priessnitzs hydrotherapy soon spread to the rest of Europe and eventually to the United States. Celebrities and other famous folks took to it, like, well, a duck to water and helped popularize the cold water cure with the masses. For example, Charles Darwin (a chronically sick guy and owner of an awesomely manly beard) was a huge proponent of hydrotherapy. The first hydrotherapy facility opened up in the U.S in 1843, right when the sanitarium craze hit America. By the the end of the 19th century, over 200 hydrotherapy/sanitarium resorts existed in the U.S., the most famous being the Battle Creek Sanitarium founded by John Harvey Kellogg. You know. The guy who invented corn flakes. And believed in the awesome power of enemas and a squeaky clean colon.

The popularity of hydrotherapy began to decline in the 20th century as many in the medical field moved to drugs to treat illnesses. As doctors concentrated on conventional medicine, more holistic methods began to be seen as quackery. While hydrotherapy was prescribed less and less to cure illnesses, doctors continued to use it to treat injuries such as strained muscles and broken bones. Youll find athletes today taking ice baths to speed their recovery from injuries and intense workouts.

Benefits of Cold Water Showers

While doctors may no longer instruct their patients to take a cold bath and call them in the morning, a shot of cold water can still impart real health benefits:

Improves circulation. Good blood circulation is vital for overall cardiovascular health. Healthy blood circulation also speeds up recovery time from strenuous exercises and work. Alternating between hot and cold water while you shower is an easy way to improve your circulation. Cold water causes your blood to move to your organs to keep them warm. Warm water reverses the effect by causing the blood to move towards the surface of the skin. Cold shower proponents argue that stimulating the circulatory system in this way keeps them healthier and younger looking than their hot water-loving counterparts.

Relieves depression. Lots of great men from history suffered bouts of depression. Henry David Thoreau is one such man. But perhaps Thoreau's baths in chilly Walden Pond helped keep his black dog at bay. Research at the Department of Radiation Oncology at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine indicates that short cold showers may stimulate the brain's u201Cblue spotu201D — the brain's primary source of noradrenaline  a chemical that could help mitigate depression. I guess a bout of the blues isn't so bad after all.

Keeps skin and hair healthy. Hot water dries out skin and hair. If you want to avoid an irritating itch and ashy elbows, turn down the temperature of your showers. Also, cold water can make your manly mane look shinier and your skin look healthier by closing up your cuticles and pores.

It's time for the Lew Rockwell website and it's traitorous commentators to get with the program.

Let me explain to you the most fundamental principle of American foreign policy: Any country where the people have unpronounceable names can be bombed by the US with impunity. For you Rockwell readers who are a little slow on the uptake, ""impunity"" means they aren't allowed to bomb us back. ""We called no tag-backs."" It hardly qualifies as impunity when they blow up our biggest buildings, now does it? They aren't playing by the rules.

There's only one appropriate response to the destruction of the World Trade Centers: massive bombing of someone, anyone. Let's not quibble about whom; it's more important that the bombing commence, and the sooner the better. Ann Coulter represents the feelings of the American people when she says:

""This is no time to be precious about locating the exact individuals directly involved in this particular terrorist attack. … We weren’t punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That’s war. And this is war.""

Ms. Coulter has concisely summed up the situation: our bombing needs to be massive, indiscriminate and unrelenting. Forget limp-wristed namby-pamby concepts like ""targeted strikes""; no, we want ""carpet bombing."" Only one motto can adequately describe our policy towards the Arab world: ""Kill them all, and let Allah sort out his own."" If murdering innocent civilians in order to dramatize internal rage was a good enough policy for the hijackers of the four airliners, then it's good enough for the USA.

This country cannot afford to tolerate nay-sayers who doubt the effectiveness of indiscriminate bombing inflicted on countries located on the other side of the world. Didn't it work in Vietnam and Iraq? But we needn't go back that far in history. Look how well Russia is handling a Muslim insurgency (led by ex-Mujihadeen) in Chechnya. True, they have the advantage of fighting these rebels in their own country, so it's no wonder they're succeeding. But the fact that Afghanistan is a mountainous, land-locked country 10,000 miles from the US and virtually surrounded by fellow Muslim nations should not deter us from our resolve to exercise our righteous indignation.

President Bush, however, has pointed out a potential drawback to this policy, “When I take action I’m not going to fire a $$2 million missile at a $$10 empty tent and hit a camel in the butt. It’s going to be decisive.” As President Bush implies, Afghanistan doesn't even have any targets worth demolishing. After twenty years of unremitting warfare and devastation, today there's hardly one stone left standing upon another in the entire country. Afghanis are preoccupied with concerns such as locating their next meal. That's why they're living in ""$$10 tents.""

Fortunately, Ms. Coulter's article suggests a more appropriate target for carpet-bombing: Germany. As she says, ""We did it before, why not do it again?"" As far as ""harboring terrorists,"" the credentials of the Germans are much better than the Taleban. Where did this terrorist cell originate before it came to the US to do its evil work? Hamburg! If we're going to start carpet-bombing countries that harbor terrorists, here is our obvious first target. To make things easier on us, most of the Germans even have funny names like ""Gunter"" and ""Helmut,"" practically as strange as ""Osama."" And while we're sending in the heavy bombers, we can wipe out Dresden again, just for old times sakes.

Once we've ""bombed back to the stone age"" those harborers of terrorism in Germany, let us not forget the stirring words of Sen. Lieberman: ""In this struggle, vengeance is not victory. Retaliation for yesterday’s atrocities is only the end of the beginning of what should be our response, not the beginning of the end of that response."" Vengeance upon Germany should be only a start, but where should we strike next? The answer is obvious: Egypt and Saudi Arabia!

None of the 19 terrorists were Afghanis; they weren't even Iraqis, Iranians or Palestinians. But the FBI is indicating that most, if not all, are connected to either Egypt or Saudi Arabia. Will we withhold from these countries the ""hammer of Thor"" merely because they are our most reliable allies in the Middle East? No! Let us never again make the mistake of distinguishing between terrorists and those who harbor them. These countries must be wiped off the map. Let the bombing of Cairo commence. And while we're at it, we can buy a few one-way tickets to Canada for any yellow-bellied pacifists who complain about unavoidable ""collateral damage"" to civilians.

Now I'm not saying that we shouldn't drop a few bombs here and there on some other targets. After all, back in July our Department of Defense proclaimed, ""The United States reserves the right to strike targets at a time and a place and a manner of our choosing."" In other words, we can bomb anyone, anywhere, anyway we damn well please. In February President Bush ordered attacks on five locations around Baghdad ""to get Saddam Hussein's attention."" That policy obviously succeeded beyond our wildest expectations. No reason we shouldn't try it again. Nor will I be the kind of party-pooper who complains whenever the military has a little harmless fun rattling Moammar Qadhafi's cage. Libya would be insulted if they were left out of the ""network of terror."" But doesn't it make more sense to go after the bigger  and more obviously guilty  parties first? Only when Hamburg's soil has been sown with salt will true-blue red-blooded Americans be able to sleep soundly at night.

This is the foreword to Lies the Government Told You by Andrew P. Napolitano

Andrew P. Napolitano is a true rarity among judges and media personalities: He is a passionate defender of liberty who understands that the United States Constitution puts strict limits on federal power. Judge Napolitano’s tremendous knowledge of American law, history, and politics, as well as his passion for freedom, shines through in Lies the Government Told You, as he details how throughout American history, politicians and government officials have betrayed the ideals of personal liberty and limited government.

Anyone who knows Judge Napolitano understands that he does not pull his punches or excuse any constitutional violations in order to support any group or political interest. Thus, Lies the Government Told You explains how politicians of both parties have routinely disregarded the constitutional limits on federal power and violated our natural rights.

One of the most important lessons Judge Napolitano teaches is how many shared premises there are by advocates of big government from both the right and the left. For example, Judge Napolitano exposes how both the conservatives’ war on marijuana and the liberals’ war on tobacco are manifestations of paternalism — the idea that government has the legitimate authority to stop adults from doing bad things, like smoking substances that politicians and bureaucrats do not approve of. Of course, smoking, whether of marijuana or tobacco, does have negative health consequences — but respecting the right of individuals to be wrong, as long as they do not interfere with the rights of others, is one of the pillars of a free society.

Lies the Government Told You also avoids the all-too-common error of drawing a distinction between ""personal"" liberty and ""economic"" liberty, and focusing on attacks on one type of freedom while ignoring or even supporting attacks on the other category of liberty. When the freedom movement began in the nineteenth century, supporters of liberty, who were then known as ""liberals,"" made no distinctions between government actions that interfered with economic liberties, such as laws infringing upon private contracts, and government actions that restricted personal liberty, such as limits on the freedom of speech. Supporters of liberty were also likely to understand the grave threat posed to liberty and constitutional government by a militaristic foreign policy. Thus, they were also supporters of peace.

However, beginning in the Progressive Era, promoters of big government co-opted the rhetoric of the promoters of freedom, even stealing the label ""liberal."" Whereas liberal once referred to a supporter of freedom, beginning in the Progressive Era, the term liberal began to refer to supporters of the welfare state. The division between supporters of ""economic"" and ""personal"" freedoms was accelerated by the Cold War, when many supporters of free markets allowed their (justifiable) loathing of communism to lead them to embrace militarism abroad and limitations on personal freedom at home. Thanks to this division between the supporters of personal and economic liberty, it is not uncommon to find opponents of socialized medicine arguing for the Patriot Act, and supporters of gun control arguing for free speech.

One chapter of this book that is particularly important to me deals with monetary policy. Anyone who has followed my career knows that exposing and ending the damage done to our prosperity and freedom by the Federal Reserve’s fiat currency system drives much of what I do. While there is substantial literature explaining the myriad ways the Federal Reserve damages our economy, there is not nearly as much writing that explains how the Federal Reserve System violates the Constitution and ties the Federal Reserve to the general assault on liberty waged by Big Government. This book helps fill that gap.

As a congressional representative from a Gulf Coast district who has seen how the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) fails to live up to its promise to provide assistance to victims of natural disasters in a timely and thorough manner, I particularly enjoyed Judge Napolitano’s dissection of the constitutional and practical problems with FEMA.

I have only scratched the surface of the many virtues of this important work. Lies the Government Told You will provide those active in the freedom movement with much-needed intellectual ammunition. This book can also help open the eyes of those who are yet to recognize the assault on our liberty by politicians and bureaucrats. I am pleased to recommend this book to anyone who cares about the direction of this country and wants to understand how we got where we are, and what we need to do to regain our liberties.

219596,"In 1798, the legislatures of Virginia and Kentucky approved resolutions that affirmed the states’ right to resist federal encroachments on their powers. If the federal government has the exclusive right to judge the extent of its own powers, warned the resolutions’ authors (James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, respectively), it will continue to grow — regardless of elections, the separation of powers, and other much-touted limits on government power. The Virginia Resolutions spoke of the states’ right to ""interpose"" between the federal government and the people of the state; the Kentucky Resolutions (in a 1799 follow-up to the original resolutions) used the term ""nullification"" — the states, they said, could nullify unconstitutional federal laws.1

These ideas became known as the ""Principles of ’98."" Their subsequent impact on American history, according to the standard narrative, was pretty much confined to South Carolina’s nullification of the tariffs of 1828 and 1832. That is demonstrably false, as I shall show below. But it isn’t just that these ideas are neglected in the usual telling; as I discovered not long ago, these principles are positively despised by neoconservatives like Max Boot and the leftists at the New York Times (or do I repeat myself?). Neither one, in their reviews of The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History, so much as mentioned Jefferson’s name in connection with the Principles of ’98. It is hard to view such an omission as anything but deliberate. To mention Jefferson’s name is to lend legitimacy to ideas that nationalists of left and right alike detest, so they simply leave him out of the picture.

Jefferson once wrote, ""When all government, domestic and foreign, in little as in great things, shall be drawn to Washington as the center of all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another, and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated."" To resist this centralizing trend, the sage of Monticello was convinced, the states needed some kind of corporate defense mechanism.

Our betters have already told us that the only reason anyone might wish to vindicate the cause of states’ rights is for the purpose of defending slavery or upholding some lesser form of local oppression. What follows is the tip of the iceberg of the history that, by what I shall assume is an entirely well-meaning and innocent oversight, these great scholars of American history consistently fail to acknowledge.

The Embargo of 1807—1809

In retaliation against British and French depredations against American neutral rights on the seas, the federal government under Thomas Jefferson in late 1807 declared an embargo, according to which no American ship could depart for any foreign port anywhere in the world. (The rationale was that trade with the U.S. was a key ingredient in British and French prosperity, and thus that economic pressure might persuade them to change their policies.) The U.S. Navy was granted the power to stop and search any ship within U.S. jurisdiction if its officers had ""reason to suspect"" the ship was violating the embargo. Likewise, customs officials were ""authorized to detain any vessel…whenever in their opinions the intention is to violate or evade any provisions of the acts laying an embargo."" Such standards fell far short of the ""probable cause"" requirement that generally governed the issuing of warrants for searches.

New England was especially hard hit by the embargo because so many of its people were employed either directly in foreign commerce or in proximate fields, and it was there that opposition to the policy was concentrated. In 1808 a federal district court, in the case of United States v. The William, ruled the embargo constitutional. The Massachusetts legislature begged to differ. Both houses declared the embargo acts to be ""in many particulars, unjust, oppressive, and unconstitutional."" ""While this State maintains its sovereignty and independence, all the citizens can find protection against outrage and injustice in the strong arm of the State government,"" they said. The embargo, furthermore, was ""not legally binding on the citizens of this State.""

In the midst of the crisis, a New York congressman, giving his explicit sanction to the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions, said, ""Why should not Massachusetts take the same stand, when she thinks herself about to be destroyed?"" ""If any State Legislature had believed the Act to be unconstitutional,"" asked a Connecticut congressman, ""would it not have been their duty not to comply?"" He added that the state legislatures, ""whose members are sworn to support the Constitution, may refuse assistance, aid or cooperation"" if they regarded an act as unconstitutional, and so could state officials.

Connecticut governor Jonathan Trumbull shared these views. ""Whenever our national legislature is led to overleap the prescribed bounds of their constitutional powers, on the State Legislatures, in great emergencies, devolves the arduous task — it is their right — it becomes their duty, to interpose their protecting shield between the right and liberty of the people, and the assumed power of the General Government."" Connecticut’s General Assembly passed a resolution that, among other things, directed all executive officials in the State not to afford ""any official aid or co-operation in the execution of the act aforesaid.""

The General Assembly furthermore declared: ""Resolved, that to preserve the Union, and support the Constitution of the United States, it becomes the duty of the Legislatures of the States, in such a crisis of affairs, vigilantly to watch over, and vigorously to maintain, the powers not delegated to the United States, but reserved to the States respectively, or to the people; and that a due regard to this duty, will not permit this Assembly to assist, or concur in giving effect to the aforesaid unconstitutional act, passed, to enforce the embargo.""

Rhode Island, when the embargo was at its end, declared that her legislature possessed the duty ""to interpose for the purpose of protecting [the people of Rhode Island] from the ruinous inflictions of usurped and unconstitutional power.""

Interposition — the language of the Principles of ’98.

The War of 1812

During the War of 1812, Massachusetts and Connecticut were ordered to call out their respective militias for the purpose of defending the coast. The call derived from the federal government’s authority to call the state militias into service ""to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel invasions.""

Massachusetts Governor Caleb Strong, however, maintained that the states reserved the power to determine whether any of these three conditions held. At Strong’s request, the Massachusetts Supreme Court offered its opinion. That court agreed with the governor: ""As this power is not delegated to the United States by the Federal Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, it is reserved to the states, respectively; and from the nature of the power, it must be exercised by those with whom the states have respectively entrusted the chief command of the militia.""

Connecticut followed suit:

It must not be forgotten, that the state of Connecticut is a FREE SOVEREIGN and INDEPENDENT state; that the United States are a confederacy of states; that we are a confederated and not a consolidated republic. The governor of this state is under a high and solemn obligation, ""to maintain the lawful rights and privileges thereof, as a sovereign, free and independent state,"" as he is ""to support the constitution of the United States,"" and the obligation to support the latter, imposes an additional obligation to support the former.

Thus if the militia were called out for any purpose but those listed in the Constitution, it ""would be not only the height of injustice to the militia…but a violation of the constitution and laws of this state, and of the United States."" The president had no authority to call upon the militia of Connecticut ""to assist in carrying on an offensive war"" (some New Englanders were convinced that the war was aimed primarily at the annexation of Canada). Connecticut would not comply with the federal order until New England should be threatened ""by an actual invasion of any portion of our territory.""

From a political point of view, the War of 1812 would wind up essentially a draw, and the Treaty of Ghent signed in December 1814 reestablished the status quo ante bellum. From a military point of view, though, it was a British rout. As a result, Congress seriously entertained the prospect of military conscription.

Here is where Daniel Webster, so often a villain in American history, emerges as positively heroic. With his usual eloquence he spoke out against military conscription as incompatible with both the Constitution and the principles of a free society. ""Where is it written in the Constitution,"" he asked, ""in what article or section is it contained, that you may take children from their parents, and parents from their children, and compel them to fight the battles of any war in which the folly or the wickedness of government may engage it?"" (Predictable quarters can now be expected to call Daniel Webster — than whom there was no greater or more eloquent defender of the federal Union — an unpatriotic, America-hating leftist.)

What did Webster think should be done if the conscription bill should pass? In that case, he said, it would be ""the solemn duty of the State Governments to protect their own authority over their own militia, and to interpose between their citizens and arbitrary power."" Interposition — the language, once again, of the great resolutions of ’98.

In December 1813 a new and more obnoxious embargo than that of 1807-1809 was instituted. The Massachusetts legislature found itself inundated with petitions and statements of grievances. A special committee, headed by William Lloyd, was established to devise a response to the situation. The Massachusetts General Court approved the committee’s report early the following year. It read, in part:

A power to regulate commerce is abused, when employed to destroy it; and a manifest and voluntary abuse of power sanctions the right of resistance, as much as a direct and palpable usurpation. The sovereignty reserved to the states, was reserved to protect the citizens from acts of violence by the United States, as well as for purposes of domestic regulation. We spurn the idea that the free, sovereign and independent State of Massachusetts is reduced to a mere municipal corporation, without power to protect its people, and to defend them from oppression, from whatever quarter it comes. Whenever the national compact is violated, and the citizens of this State are oppressed by cruel and unauthorized laws, this Legislature is bound to interpose its power, and wrest from the oppressor its victim.

Need we point out yet again the language of the Principles of ’98?

Fugitive Slave Laws

At a time when the federal government was using its police powers to enforce the capture of runaway slaves, it was the state governments, expressly recalling the Principles of ’98, that determined to resist. (See Mark Thornton here [.pdf] on how the federal government socialized the costs of slaveholding.) Although the Constitution did, unfortunately, contain a clause calling for the return of runaways, some Northern states resorted to the argument that that document spelled out no particular enforcement mechanism behind that requirement.

In addition, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was especially obnoxious and repugnant. It placed all fugitive slave cases under federal jurisdiction. Fugitives were denied jury trials and the right to testify in their own defense. Special commissioners were empowered to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused, and according to the terms of the act were to be paid $$10 if they found the accused fugitive guilty and only $$5 if they found him innocent. Still more obnoxious features included the right to force bystanders to participate in the capture of a fugitive and stiff penalties for sheltering or obstructing the capture of a fugitive.

Several Northern states simply refused to comply. Especially interesting is this 1859 statement of the Wisconsin Supreme Court — taken, in parts word for word, from the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798:

Resolved, That the government formed by the Constitution of the United States was not the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself; but that, as in all other cases of compact among parties having no common judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress.

Resolved, that the principle and construction contended for by the party which now rules in the councils of the nation, that the general government is the exclusive judge of the extent of the powers delegated to it, stop nothing short of despotism, since the discretion of those who administer the government, and not the Constitution, would be the measure of their powers; that the several states which formed that instrument, being sovereign and independent, have the unquestionable right to judge of its infractions; and that a positive defiance of those sovereignties, of all unauthorized acts done or attempted to be done under color of that instrument, is the rightful remedy.

Many more examples of the ongoing relevance of the Principles of ’98 could be cited. In the midst of a dispute with the federal government over the Second Bank of the United States, the Ohio legislature voted to affirm the Principles of ’98. In 1825, Kentucky’s governor said: ""When the general government encroaches upon the rights of the State, is it a safe principle to admit that a portion of the encroaching power shall have the right to determine finally whether an encroachment has been made or not? In fact, most of the encroachments made by the general government flow through the Supreme Court itself, the very tribunal which claims to be the final arbiter of all such disputes. What chance for justice have the States when the usurpers of their rights are made their judges? Just as much as individuals when judged by their oppressors. It is therefore believed to be the right, as it may hereafter become the duty of the State governments, to protect themselves from encroachments, and their citizens from oppression, by refusing obedience to the unconstitutional mandates of the federal judges.""

These are facts. They are facts that constitute a central part of antebellum American history. Yet to say that the standard American history text does not trace the influence of the Principles of ’98 over the course of the ensuing years, as I have done all too briefly here, would be the understatement of the century. The profession at large has essentially ignored the issue; other than Bill Watkins’ excellent study, you’d be hard-pressed to find a single book-length treatment of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 over the past hundred years.

Thus when I resurrected these long-neglected ideas in chapter four of The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History, did this inclusion merit the praise of your average scholar? To the contrary, the general complaint was that I hadn’t spent more time on subjects people already know inside and out. As for the Principles of ’98 themselves, discussing them with left- or right-wing nationalists is like waving garlic before Dracula.

Not that raising the issue makes them clam up entirely. To the contrary, they’ll find some silly photos of you (which, I confess, exist in embarrassing abundance), or dredge up something you did or said a dozen years ago, or generally suggest you’re a bad person. (Everyone who’s ever met me knows I’m just a great big meanie.)

They may behave this way because they think doing so will make me shut up (no such luck there), but it’s also a lot easier than cracking a book on a subject they don’t seem to know the first thing about.

Note

In his exposition of the Virginia Resolutions in 1833, Virginia legal thinker Abel Upshur argued very precisely that the Virginia Resolutions did in fact call for nullification, Madison’s later protests to the contrary notwithstanding. Prof. Kevin Gutzman writes, ""The distinction so often drawn between Jefferson’s strident and Madison’s moderate tone seems strained; there is no difference between ‘null, void, and of no force or effect’ and ‘invalidity,’ between ‘nullifying’ a statute and ‘interpos[ing]’ to prevent its enforcement.""

I want to write that post someday; this isn’t it.

I will return to something from my “Clowns” post, something that struck me afterwards. In the post, I referenced a comment from John Kerry. His comment is in reference to the Iran nuclear agreement. He cautions those congressmen and others as being mistaken regarding their belief of the leverage America holds over the rest of the world, those who falsely believe…

“’America is strong enough…we can just bring the hammer down and force people to do what we want to do…'” – John Kerry

Now, you read that comment and think “bring the hammer down.” What immediately comes to mind? Drone strikes? B-52s? Aircraft carriers? Viruses delivered via the NSA? Bob the Builder (just kidding, I want to see if you are paying attention)?

Now, I am playing a little game as I have excluded a key portion of his statement:

“If everybody thinks ‘Oh, no, we’re just tough. . . . we can force people. . . . America is strong enough, our banks are tough enough, we can just bring the hammer down and force people to do what we want to do,'”

“Our banks are tough enough”!

Our banks. Kerry is Secretary of State; he is not Treasury Secretary (not that this should make any difference). He is an employee of the US government; he does not himself own any of these banks (well, not to my knowledge).

Our banks. Not our tanks. Our banks.

In whatever country you live, whatever currency you regularly use: imagine being blocked out of the system. No bank deposits or withdrawals; no credit card transactions; no debit card transactions; no wire transfers. No ability to bank.

Pretty tough, huh.

Almost every country in the world is in some manner or another dependent on the US Dollar; if this isn’t enough, they are also dependent on the transaction infrastructure (back-office, if you will) provided by US banks.

Imagine being shut out of this system. This is the weapon that Kerry referenced.

Now, this concept of the banks as a weapon may not be a big surprise to many of you. But have you ever heard a high-level US government official say so? I don’t recall it.

However, Kerry is saying that this weapon – always reliable in the past – may not be as potent in the future.

Have you ever heard a high-level US government official say this? American power – American banks – may not be omnipotent?

I haven’t either.

369787,"War is an intractable issue that always seems to be in the news. At any given moment more than a dozen wars are likely be in progress around the world — and every decade the major powers get involved in some conflict somewhere. Popular writers shoot off their thoughts on the latest crises, but often their contributions soon begin to look outdated. My book A Philosophy of War seeks to explain war rather than wars and attempts to produce a more durable explanation of war's nature and origins.

Most philosophers who have written on war have provided singular explanations of why we wage war: they blame the environment, our genes, culture, technology, or even our reason. In other words, they claim that man cannot stop war — it is in his nature to wage war. On the other hand, political writers on the subject enjoy describing and fleshing out the details of balance of power theories and try to avoid philosophical thinking; yet these too employ the philosophical argument that war is inevitable or that conflict is innate in human affairs, and the best we can do is to maneuver ourselves politically and militarily into a dominant or protected position.

Such thinking requires challenging, and in the book I advance the argument that war is the product of man's ideas and hence is a product of his choice. I was greatly influenced by the works of Ludwig Mises and the Austrian school after I had completed my degree in economics: throughout my M.A. in Economics and Ph.D. in Philosophy I sought to incorporate the school's method and framework into various essays. My doctorate was on the Philosophy of War, from which this book is a natural outgrowth. In it, I seek to synthesize Mises's premise that man acts on his ideas with Friedrich Hayek's insights into the role and nature of human knowledge. If we act on ideas, then it goes without saying that belligerent ideas will lead to war, and students of the Austrian school are quick to point out the militancy implied in a host of economic theories — notably socialism, mercantilism, and Keynesianism. Yet I was also concerned about man's desire to sustain old thoughts on war that linger around in our cultural and political vocabulary in new guises. I concluded that many of our ideas on how to behave, our moral status, our relationship with others, are often sublimated our thinking. Nonetheless, they are accessible to reason, for they are the product of reason, or at least of human action, but too often much that we take for granted is passed on down through the generations without proper consideration or reflection. The ideas that motivate us to go to war are of this kind.

The moral goal for humanity is to become more reasonable and to renounce violence. However, I argue that the gains of the Age of Enlightenment and of philosophical rationalism are relatively vulnerable: they are culturally shallow in comparison to the grand ideologies of war that we inherit and pass on. Only where the free market has developed and advanced unhampered by intervention do we see a reduction in men's latent desires to conquer and kill. But even in the West, it does not take much to stir atavistic dreams of revenge and to encourage men to turn their backs on peace in favor of war.

In the book I examine a variety of determinist theories of war — those theories that assume man cannot help what he does. In rejecting all that seeks to deny humanity of choice, I nonetheless try to incorporate those elements that are particularly useful in explaining war's attraction. For example, I thoroughly reject the idea that war can be explained by referring to man's biological make-up, but acknowledge, as Mises does, the strong draw such adrenaline boosting, collective violence can have on a man. The culturalist theory — that we are a product of our culture — offers much to explain why some folks are more militant than others, but the determinist variant would have us believe that a culture is an external agency imposed upon us and not the product of the ideas and behavior we accept and sustain over time. Again, the useful elements ought to be removed and the determinist philosophy rejected!

In all, I attempt to produce a solid theory of war's nature and origins. The book deploys a number of historical and literary anecdotes to supplement the theoretical analysis and provides two applied examinations of protracted warfare  Bohemia and Vietnam. In both areas, war has rarely been absent and it is a poor politician who considers that a thousand years of conflict could be stopped by the appeal to be reasonable! War's origins are complex but not beyond our understanding: certainly, our ideas need to change, but the free-market and libertarian philosophy needs to become embedded in our cultural outlook before war dissipates completely.

373847,"The FBI account of suspected Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s apprehension by MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority) police in the federal indictment against him was self-serving at best, and fanciful at worst:

On the evening of April 19, 2013, police investigation revealed that there was an individual in a covered boat located at 67 Franklin Street in Watertown. After a stand-off between the boat’s occupant and the police involving gunfire, the individual was removed from the boat and searched.

While it was technically true that Tsarnaev’s apprehension “involved” gunfire, Tsarnaev was not among those who had fired any of the guns that night. The FBI later admitted that Tsarnaev had been unarmed in the boat. All of the dozens – possibly hundreds – of rounds fired off in the moments before the arrest were by arresting officers or their back-up units, not by Tsarnaev. After that cowboy-like melee, the wounded Tsarnaev was arrested.

The FBI account implied a back-and-forth gun battle that ended in Tsarnaev’s surrender. But the reality was that trigger-happy police risked killing an unarmed suspect who already had suffered serious wounds. In essence, it’s only by sheer luck – and poor marksmanship – that Tsarnaev will live to stand trial for his alleged crimes. Interestingly, officials are also investigating whether MBTA Police Officer Richard Donahue was wounded by friendly fire in the shoot-out the night before that resulted in the death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Dzhokhar’s older brother.

Moreover, it wasn’t so much a “police investigation” that revealed Tsarnaev to law enforcement as it was a tip from a Watertown resident after the governor’s curfew had been lifted. Franklin Street resident David Henneberry left his house to inspect his boat after police lifted the Watertown curfew. There Henneberry found Tsarnaev in the boat, bleeding, and called the police. Henneberry’s house was a couple of blocks outside of the official search zone, where police were conducting house-to-house searches. In essence, the dragnet-style search ordered by politicians in charge of the police response had done nothing to apprehend the suspect. Nor did the massive use of military ordnance on display on the streets of Boston-area towns speed the apprehension of the suspects. In fact, the “stay-in-place” curfew – officially voluntary – likely delayed apprehension of the 19-year-old Tsarnaev. The political order to vacate the streets had the practical effect of taking a million pairs of eyes off the getaway scene for the duration of the curfew.

Even the criminal charge against Tsarnaev was a result of a legislative exaggeration. The official federal indictment charged Tsarnaev and his brother – who had been killed in a shootout with police the previous night – with using a “weapon of mass destruction.” The term “weapon of mass destruction” (WMD) was once a term describing only chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, but in 1994, federal law expanded the definition to include any “destructive device” (bomb) or big-bore “projectile” of more than .50 caliber. By the 1994 legal standard, even an air-powered potato gun can legally qualify as a WMD.

Ironically, the Tsarnaev brothers – if guilty of the Boston Marathon bombings – will have killed fewer people than many other ordinary serial killers. The death toll in the whole Boston area spree was five people (including the elder Tsarnaev brother), whereas – for example – in October 2002, Washington, D.C., snipers John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo killed 10 people. By way of contrast, officials in Washington, D.C., did not shut down much of the metropolitan area – as Massachusetts officials did – in order to look for the suspects. Nor did Washington politicians call out the National Guard or employ massive military equipment in order to deal with what was in reality a greater threat to public safety. The divergence between the reactions to threats in public safety today and how officials reacted just a few years ago is telling.

Terrorism: Fear Is Greater Than the Actual Threat

As radical leftist organizer Saul Alinsky once pronounced in his book Rules for Radicals, with political force “the action is in the reaction,” meaning that sometimes it’s more effective to take advantage of a provocation – or even create one – in order to achieve political goals. Alinsky also noted that in politics “the threat itself is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.” Both such “rules for radicals” apply to the terrorism problem, in that Americans will not give up their cherished freedoms absent a perceived threat. Thus, liberty-hating radicals have come out of the woodwork in the Boston Marathon bombing aftermath, proposing “cures” for the terrorist threat that involve vastly expanded government intelligence and massive surveillance of Americans.

Those calls for more government surveillance of Americans have found a voice in the mayor of New York City. “We live in a complex world where you’re going to have to have a level of security greater than you did back in the olden days,” Michael Bloomberg said in an April press conference. “And our laws and our interpretation of the Constitution, I think, have to change.” Mayor Bloomberg went on to conclude: “Look, we live in a very dangerous world. We know there are people who want to take away our freedoms. New Yorkers probably know that as much if not more than anybody else after the terrible tragedy of 9/11.”

In those few sentences, Bloomberg outlined the two false assumptions in virtually every call for more surveillance of Americans: 1. This point in history with the emergence of bombers is new and more scary than in the past and 2. Trading away freedoms for security will lead to more security.

Even before Dhzokhar Tsarnaev’s arrest, slate.com’s technology columnist Farhad Manjoo had joined the surveillance cheerleading squad in his April 19 column for the online magazine: “Cities under the threat of terrorist attack should install networks of cameras to monitor everything that happens at vulnerable urban installations. Yes, you don’t like to be watched. Neither do I. But of all the measures we might consider to improve security in an age of terrorism, installing surveillance cameras everywhere may be the best choice. They’re cheap, less intrusive than many physical security systems, and – as will hopefully be the case with the Boston bombing – they can be extremely effective at solving crimes.”

Manjoo frets about this being an age of terrorism, even though America has been in the era of terrorism at least since the 1886 Chicago Haymarket Riot, when an anarchist bomb-thrower tossed a handmade dynamite bomb into a crowd of police trying to break up an anarchist demonstration. Several police were killed in the blast, and others were killed by police friendly fire in the ensuing melee. The Haymarket Riot later became a global communist holiday after the Second International in Paris commemorated the riots in 1889. Although Chicago police were unable to find the Haymarket bomb-thrower, they did find the bomb factory and many of the bomb-thrower’s confederates.

Law-enforcement agencies had better luck tracking down a far larger wave of bombings from 1917-20 in the wake of the anarchist/Bolshevik revolutions in Europe. The United States suffered some 125 bombing attempts across the country. In April 1919, the bombers sent 36 mail bombs of dynamite to congressmen, leading businessmen, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, governors, leading newspapers, and U.S. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer. On June 2 of the same year, the anarchists tried again, setting off larger bombs in eight different cities and again targeting leading politicians and businessmen, including Attorney General Palmer. On September 1, 1920, a horse-drawn cart full of 500 pounds of dynamite – surrounded by metal shrapnel – exploded on Wall Street, killing 38 people.

The era was known as the “Red Scare” despite the fact that the threat was real, and Attorney General Palmer called for the deportation of the anarchists (mostly Italian followers of Luigi Galleani) and Bolsheviks (mostly Russian) from the country as a cure for the chaos:

I have been asked, for instance, to what extent deportation will check radicalism in this country. Why not ask what will become of the United States Government if these alien radicals are permitted to carry out the principles of the Communist Party as embodied in its so-called laws, aims and regulations? There wouldn’t be any such thing left. In place of the United States Government we should have the horror and terrorism of bolsheviki tyranny such as is destroying Russia now.

Reaction to the “Red Scare” of 1919-20 involved the same type of apocalyptic rhetoric as that employed against the threat of Islamic extremism today. And it involved some repression of civil liberties: Aliens were deported without formal due process and the Justice Department’s Bureau of Investigation (a forerunner of the FBI) engaged in warrantless searches and seizures. But the reaction to more than one hundred bombings was otherwise far more muted than the response to the Boston Marathon bombings: The federal government and local police did not call out the National Guard and deploy military ordnance on the streets of America, nor did they shut down whole cities or collude with local officials to issue curfew restrictions. Perhaps most importantly, the popular reaction against the Palmer raids strengthened the idea that civil liberties needed to be protected.

At every turn, the state seeks to undermine our thrift. Without thrift, our liberty and property are in jeopardy. We must struggle against the tide of the state's institutions to embrace the age-old virtue of thrift.

First, a review of the problem. Second, a suggested plan for the economist1 hopeful.

According to Samuel Smiles in his book Thrift, Samuel Johnson called Thrift the daughter of Prudence, the sister of Temperance, and the mother of Liberty. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon famously declared that Liberty is the Mother, not the daughter, of Order. So, we have a family tree of virtues: Prudence begets Thrift which begets Liberty which begets Order. Of course, from economics, we also know that Thrift begets Capital which begets Prosperity. Smiles's book Self-Help documents hundreds of cases of people improving their conditions and the conditions of others through thrift. Alas, as far as I know, there is no modern equivalent to the sweeping scope of Self-Help.

Also from Smiles's Thrift: ""Some of man’s best qualities depend upon the right use of money — such as his generosity, benevolence, justice, honesty, and forethought. Many of his worst qualities also originate in the bad use of money — such as greed, miserliness, injustice, extravagance, and improvidence."" As we know from the doctrine of the unity of the virtues, individual virtue is necessarily connected to political opinions, and so Smiles has perhaps shown us that a man handling his own money well paves the path to political virtue as well. So, this attack on thrift by the state is an attack on virtue generally, and we can expect that it has spillover effects in the adoption of ideologies that apologize for vices.

The state seeks to usurp our liberty and take our property by appeals to disorder and destitution. One way in which we know the state is evil is that it attacks us in a pincer maneuver, undermining our thrift, which results in disorder and destitution, and then from the other flank, using these results to further usurp our liberty and take our property. How does it do this?

Money. The state, having captured the free market institution of money, having destroyed its link to gold and silver, and having centralized and cartelized the supply of money, inflates the money supply to monetize its growing debt and reward elites. This has two primary effects for the individual. First, it has become virtually impossible to use money as a store of value. Its value erodes away if kept for years, so it is necessary to invest any money saved, just to keep pace with inflation. Second, inflation causes investments to be riskier, by causing business cycles. The best explication of this is What Has Government Done to Our Money by Murray Rothbard.

Taxes. Not only is taxation perhaps the most evil institution left on earth, now that chattel slavery is virtually extinct, taxation distorts the individual's finances. We are all familiar with the social engineering in the US Federal Income Tax, with credits and deductions for all manner of activities the state officially encourages or discourages. But much worse is the attack on capital which the tax system represents. Consider: your wages are taxed, with what's left, you invest in stocks of companies, the profits on the companies you invest in are taxed, with what's left of that, the company pays you dividends or increases retained earnings, and then those dividends or capital gains are then taxed.

Social security and ""welfare."" The cruel hoax of this system is well known. Besides being financially unstable and subject to the whims of Congress, this system encourages people to be dependent upon the state for their financial security in old age, thereby disintegrating traditional intergenerational familial obligations. In the US, we call by the name welfare government programs such as Food Stamps, WIC, and TANF. Again, these programs disintegrate familial obligations and encourage dependence upon the state.

Credit cards. An evil attending monetary expansion is that it often ""pays"" to buy on credit, when the rate of fall in the purchasing power of money outstrips the rate of interest charged on the credit account. With interest rates artificially depressed by the monetary authorities and banks forced into a fiat monetary regime, they attempt to ""loan up,"" seeking out many high-risk borrowers, which are the cash cow of the credit industry. The otherwise good documentary Maxed Out fails to account for the major role that the state plays in these circumstances.

This is not an exhaustive list of the ways that the state attacks our thrift. Virtually everything the state does, from the FDA, to the War on (some other) Drugs, to the War in Iraq, impoverishes us and makes us less able to exercise our thrift. I only dealt here very briefly with some of the directly relevant institutions.

Not an attack on debt. Also, this is not an attack on debt per se. Gary North's excellent series on debt is well worth the time invested in reading them. That said, every person should strive to reach a point in early adulthood where he becomes free of all debt with a substantial portfolio of assets. This kind of financial independence is a source of strength that the individual, the family, the church, and other institutions can use in their defense against the predations of the state.

How to Acquire the Virtue of Thrift

To acquire a virtue, as Aristotle explained, is to acquire the habit of exercising the virtue. Most of us know what is right. It's the doing that dogs us. Comte-Sponville is wrong when he says ""I believe [virtue can be taught]"" and that the chief work to do is ""to try to understand what we should do, what we should be, and how we should live."" No — we mostly know what we should do. The best books for improving your virtue are ones such as those by Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Smiles, and Napoleon Hill. They give us inspiration and practical advice. Here is what I've learned about cultivating thrift:

Budgeting as prudence. Contra personal finance writer David Bach, a written budget is absolutely essential to thrift. It is the beginning of the whole enterprise. Each month gets its budget. To be clear, you will not have 12 budgets. You will have a budget for every month you live from now on. It must be agreed to by your spouse. You must not spend any money unless authorized by the budget — if you need to spend money not on the budget, agree to change the budget first, then spend the money. If you want to read a budgeting book, I recommend this one, though you probably don't need to. Once you have a written budget, you must discipline yourself to live below your means. The reason that a written budget helps you impose this discipline upon yourself is that you can actually see where all your money goes, instead of guessing; and, you can make considered choices about trading money among budget categories. Also, a written budget helps elucidate this reality: you tell your money where to go, it doesn't tell you where it ""needs"" to go. This is a key psychological change that is empowering and comforting.

So, if you don't live by a written budget, get off your duff and go write one! This will improve your thrift! Do it! A quick way to start is with utilities. Go grab the last year's worth of utility bills and see what the average payment is. Sign up for balanced billing for electricity and gas. It will help.

Keep your old, actual budgets for reference. Your budget should have an ""actual"" column to show where you came in. You should also have a place on your budget to list your major liquid assets (401-k, IRA, savings) and debts. All this will show you where you've been, where you're going, and provide guidance for future budgets. And, like Franklin's virtue tally, they will serve as a reminder of what needs improvement.

The Latte Factor. Both Smiles and Bach spend considerable time in their books discussing what Bach calls the ""latte factor."" If you don't think you can live beneath your means, or squeeze your budget to pay down those debts faster, you're not looking hard enough! Do you brown bag it to work every day? Do you ever buy anything from Starbucks? Do you subscribe to cable or satellite TV or radio? It's not that these luxuries should not be enjoyed — it's that when your budget needs squeezing, be merciless. You will miss your beer after work less than you think.

Use cash. Suze Orman has a technique she uses in her seminars. She has all the participants rip a dollar and then report on their psychological reactions. They report that it is a little painful. Try it yourself. Get a $$1 bill and rip it in half. Not at all like ripping a piece of paper, is it? This psychological connection to ""real money"" is an important reason to use cash as much as possible. Another reason is that you can't overspend cash. A third reason is that having cash on hand and exercising your will — resisting a purchase — builds your ability to do so.

How to use cash. The time-tested envelope method is what to use. For each budgeted category, put cash in an envelope when you get paid. Write the budget category on the outside of the envelope. Keep track of expenses by writing on the envelope and keeping receipts in the envelope. This will allow you to improve your budgeting over time.

Giving or tithing. Every personal finance author I've surveyed — David Bach, Richard Paul Evans, Suze Orman, Dave Ramsey — recommend giving or tithing a portion of your income. Christian scripture commands it. They all claim, with the weight of their experience and the experience of others they have helped, that giving or tithing paradoxically helps one's financial position. I cannot subscribe to the notion of God showering blessings upon the thrifty, but I think there is something to this. Periodic donations develop the virtue of magnanimity, and build community relationships. This impacts all of your virtues, and raises your self-esteem as someone who is a benevolent and magnanimous person. It stretches you to develop your virtues even more, and this often results in a more productive home and business life. And the fact of giving creates a psychological sense of abundance, which undoubtedly has an influence upon your subconscious which can deeply influence your behavior.

Single-mindedness. TV, radio, and billboards are filled with exhortations to buy on credit, go to the movies, go out to eat, order food in, and get the latest electronic gadget. To steel yourself against this onslaught, review your budget, talk to your spouse about how great it will be to become debt free and financially secure, read or listen to books on personal finance (check them out from the library!), and/or listen to radio shows like Dave Ramsey's. Share your financial goals with your extended family. It may seem weird to them at first, but they will sense the virtue in it and communicate that to you. It is family and community that help you to be strong against temptations.

Affirmations. Develop an affirmation such as I will be debt free by March 2011 by budgeting every month and living frugally. Repeat it to yourself daily, aloud and loud, with emotion and conviction, at least 5 times daily for 1 month. Develop within your mind a vision of what debt free will look like, feel like. What will be some of the things you'll do? Now, work these visions and the emotions they create into your daily affirmation. The point of an affirmation is to convince your subconscious that this will happen. The subconscious responds well to emotion, visualization, and repetition. Once your subconscious is ""on your side,"" then it will be your greatest ally.

A detailed plan. For specific guidance beyond this foundation of thrift, I'm a fan of Dave Ramsey's baby step plan, and I recommend his book The Total Money Makeover (check it out from the library!). The plan is simple and straightforward. It's nothing new. Our own Mark Thornton's advice is quite similar.

But what about everyone else? Let us follow Albert Jay Nock's advice: ""The only thing that the psychically human being can do to improve society is to present society with one improved unit.""

Onward thrifty libertarians!

I happily use the term ""economist"" as Samuel Smiles did in his book Thrift. Here, an economist is one who practices economy; one who is frugal, thrifty.

117211,"When news first broke of the U.S. airstrike on the Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, the response from the U.S. military was predictable and familiar. It was all just a big, terrible mistake, its official statement suggested: an airstrike it carried out in Kunduz “may have resulted in collateral damage to a nearby medical facility.” Oops: our bad. Fog of war, errant bombs, and all that.

This obfuscation tactic is the standard one the U.S. and Israel both use whenever they blow up civilian structures and slaughter large numbers of innocent people with airstrikes. Citizens of both countries are well-trained – like some tough, war-weary, cigar-chomping general – to reflexively spout the phrase “collateral damage,” which lets them forget about the whole thing and sleep soundly, telling themselves that these sorts of innocent little mistakes are inevitable even among the noblest and most well-intentioned war-fighters, such as their own governments. The phrase itself is beautifully technocratic: it requires no awareness of how many lives get extinguished, let alone Swords into Plowshares Ron Paul Best Price: $$5.17 Buy New $$11.98 (as of 03:20 EST - Details) acceptance of culpability. Just invoke that phrase and throw enough doubt on what happened in the first 48 hours and the media will quickly lose interest.

But there’s something significantly different about this incident that has caused this “mistake” claim to fail. Usually, the only voices protesting or challenging the claims of the U.S. military are the foreign, non-western victims who live in the cities and villages where the bombs fall. Those are easily ignored, or dismissed as either ignorant or dishonest. Those voices barely find their way into U.S. news stories, and when they do, they are stream-rolled by the official and/or anonymous claims of the U.S. military, which are typically treated by U.S. media outlets as unassailable authority.

Shadow Government: Sur... Tom Engelhardt Best Price: $$4.23 Buy New $$9.92 (as of 05:00 EST - Details) In this case, though, the U.S. military bombed the hospital of an organization – Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)) – run by western-based physicians and other medical care professionals. They are not so easily ignored. Doctors who travel to dangerous war zones to treat injured human beings are regarded as noble and trustworthy. They’re difficult to marginalize and demonize. They give compelling, articulate interviews in English to U.S. media outlets. They are heard, and listened to.

MSF has used this platform, unapologetically and aggressively. They are clearly infuriated at the attack on their hospital and the deaths of their colleagues and patients. From the start, they have signaled an unwillingness to be shunted away with the usual “collateral damage” banalities and, more important, have refused to let the U.S. military and its allies get away with spouting obvious falsehoods. They want real answers. As the Guardian‘s Spencer Ackerman put it last night: “MSF’s been going incredibly hard, challenging every US/Afgh claim made about hospital bombing.”

I am a law enforcement officer by trade. The area I work, as more and more areas often do nowadays, has an unfortunate problem with Meth. Most often, Meth is carried in 1.5x1.5 plastic baggies that are usually folded up. As you can imagine, people get awfully desperate when trying to hide them. As you can also imagine, a large portion of my time is spent trying to find them. If you imagine something about the size of a postage stamp or SD card that will give you a pretty good idea of the size we are dealing with. I also have investigated countless burglary calls, so have seen firsthand not only the patterns that thieves follow when searching for loot, but the patterns people follow when hiding things. I also happen to be a prepper, so in addition to needing to find stuff in my job, I understand the need for discreet storage in my personal life. I will approach this article from two ways: First, Ill go over some of the more imaginative places Ive seen things hidden, and hopefully share some tips and tricks that will open up more storage/hiding places for you. Second, Ill go over some steps and methods to help you find things if you are the one looking. The better you get at finding things, the better you get at hiding them. Whether its hiding something quickly on your person or finding something on someone you are searching, or creating a long term cache, I hope this helps open up some new avenues to you.

Part 1- Hiding things

So what are you hiding? I agree with JWR whole-heartedly that it is a lot harder for people to steal (or seize) what they cannot find. Gold/silver, guns, ammo, USB drives, documents, etc. Anything of value to you. Maybe you just need more room for your food storage. Hiding places are truly only limited by your imagination. Shape, Shine, Shadow, Silhouette etc still apply when hiding objects as well as yourself. This article will mainly focus on hiding areas and compartments. So lets begin

ON YOUR PERSON: From the bottom up, lets start with the shoes. Many of the new skate style shoes have a thick tongue. This tongue can be cut (along a seam) and items inserted in this. In addition the insole can be removed and items placed beneath. On crocs or even sandals, the sole can be split, filled, and glued back. On regular shoes, the sole (think where the air pocket on Nikes is) can usually be cut and hollowed out. The heel of a shoe tends to have a lot of padding, and this provides some area to work with. Shoes can be bought with both tongue and heel hiding places already constructed.

Obviously, anything can be tucked into a sock. For pants, the bottom cuff of pants can store items. You can also fold the cuff internally and sew or Velcro shut. Hidden pockets can be sewn anywhere on pants. Seams are good places for these, as the thickness of the material will provide support and break up any imprint of the item, and if being patted down, the hard seam may hide the object from touch. The edges of cargo pockets are also viable options, as well as the flap of the pocket. Most pocket flaps are double thickness, and can be opened, filled, and resealed easily. If you are doing this, make sure the objects are silenced and cant jangle against one another. Hidden storage belts are very common, and easily missed during a quick pat down. Likewise with the back of a belt buckle or one with a removable object on the front. The same hiding places for pants also apply to shirts, with the addition of under or inside of a collar or thicker sewn in tag. For hats, inside of the sweat band, or tucked into a slit in the underside of the bill. Foam front hats can be altered in this way as well. Belts also do not just need to be for holding your pants up. You can tuck a gun into a belt that is worn up closer to chest level (up to your arm pits) on your body in a pinch, or have a knife taped to your inner thigh or upper hamstring area. Both the Keltec P3AT and the Ruger LCP have available belt clips for them. The clip extends higher than the back of the pistol, so all that appears in a pocket is a clip that looks like a knife.

BICYCLES: Obviously, tires can be used as storage places. The frames on bikes are hollow, and can be accessed from the seat, handle bar, or even crank area on some brands. Seat stems quickly remove and provide hollow storage, especially on newer bikes with quick adjust seats. You can tape items to the underside of the seat. Or buy a seat cover and keep items between the cover and the seat. On bicycles with straight grips, you can make a thin lit in the flat distal end of the rubber grip. Items can be inserted, and the hole is self-closing. Bicycle helmets are also options, with both padding that can be removed and foam to work with. Bicycles are also stolen, so be sure to guard against this and keep this in mind when using them to store items..

VEHICLES: A whole book could be written on this, and smugglers are coming up with some pretty ingenious methods. Cars are stolen, so I dont advocate storing long term items in them (IE Guns), but there may come a time and place. Every vehicle is different. Anything with padding can be stuffed, and any dead space can be taken advantage of. I strongly encourage you to look through your vehicle, both inside and out, top and bottom. After market tube bumpers can be filled with items. Stock bumpers can have things tucked inside. Speakers can be removed. Again, tires can be filled. In the engine compartment, you can remove the air filter or fuse box. Or install a false fuse box. With all of the aftermarket items inside of cars now, its hard to tell what is stock and what is not (think about the K and N cold air filters). Get some large radiator hose and attach it to random spots in the engine compartment for some pretty secret storage. Anything that has to be bolted down is highly unlikely to be unbolted during a search, and provides a good starting point. Engines also have a lot of undercarriage armoring or protection that can be removed and used. Wheel wells usually have some storage space, and most vehicles have body panels that provide a lot of room to work with. Under a dash board, you can access vents as well as a lot of empty space. Door panels can be removed, as well as seat cushions (or slit and stuffed.) In the glove box, there is an area under the box on the door, as well as below the dash if you remove the glove box/door fully. If you have a sunroof, the area between the glass piece and the interior padding can store things. In the console area, you can remove the plastic housing. Most ashtrays remove to empty, and provide access to a dead space behind them. The soft boot on a parking brake or manual transmission can be removed and filled. Airbags can be removed. Dome lights can be removed and have the headliner accessed. The actual trunk portion that lifts up provides a lot of room, as do most light housing areas. Under any carpet in the vehicle. Behind a license plate. Under a truck bed liner. Under a false floor in a tool box in the bed. Between the tool box and bed. People can go so far as to install a smaller gas tank with a hidden compartment in the unused space. In general, the more you can return the appearance to standard, the better. If you slit a seat, install Velcro or stitch it back up. If you lift the carpet, glue it back down. Do not leave pry marks on the dash board or door panels. Old vehicles are somewhat easier to work with, as they do a better job of disguising things as minor wear and tear. If you have a rundown vehicle in the yard, you have more options. Park it on a buried 55 gallon drum. Remove the valve covers, hide things there, and replace them. If the vehicle is not running, any hoses can be filled. You can remove the wheels from a car, jack it up, put stuff where the gas tank was, then lower it down. Let your imagination guide you. Anything in the engine compartment will get hot and dirty.

THE YARD: With anything stored outside, be sure to weatherproof your container. Underground storage areas are very difficult to find, especially if you conceal them well. Metal detectors are becoming more commonplace, so be mindful of this. If it is a long term cache, leave it. Dont check it every month and leave telltale signs or a path in the grass or freshly dug dirt. If you are concerned about metal detectors, place some old pipe fittings in the dirt above your cache and below the ground level. Fence tubing can be used. If building a wall, you can fill a cinder block with goods for long term storage. If you need easier access, remove a specific cap piece on top of the wall. Like wise with a 4×4 fence post. These can be drilled nearly hollow then capped with a decorative piece. Bird houses can be filled, or built with a false floor. If building a raised bed garden, filled PVC tubes can be laid in the bottom. How many times have you seen people searching/looting a house dig up a garden? On a deck or play structure, any number of compartments can be fitted to the cross beams of the flooring. Dont overlook a childs sandbox. If you build your own, it is very simple to simply install a double floor for your goods, then fill with sand. Old cars (see above), garden hose rolls (the roller), decorative yard art or sculptures, junked appliances, again let your imagination guide you. You can remove a brick from a wall, construct a fake brick out of floral foam that can be hollowed out, and paint to match your wall. Buy an outdoor speaker rock, and remove the guts. Hide something under your wood pile. Be creative. Think like a kid again. Ask your kids where they would hide things.

HOME EXTERIOR: This is one of my favorites. Most people overlook the exterior of a home for any worthwhile goods. People know that spare keys are under mats, plants, etc, by the front door. On a patio/porch cover, if you have exposed beams, install new paneling pieces in the space between them. If you use spacers, you can still have exposed beams and hide the appearance of your cache. If you have a flat patio cover, you can hide a great number of items on top of it, against the roof. Have you ever looked behind the bird blocks on your roof? There is space there as well. Look at all of the pipes, vents, chimneys, etc, coming off of your roof. It would be very simple to construct a false vent pipe, sand to fit, paint to match, and no one would be the wiser. Likewise with the random cable, phone, sprinkler controller boxes on houses now. How many does your house have? If you cant name the number, someone looting wont know either. Buy an extra, set it up, and store away!

You can also landscape for success here too. Plants that drop a ton of leaves can hide a lot of ground work, and if you do bury something in a garden, its a great spot for your cactus collection. Hide something inside your dog house when you build it. Or your chicken coop. HOME INTERIOR: This is where it gets interesting. Most burglaries I have seen people go through all of the usual hiding places. Drawers, cabinets, closets, nightstands, mattresses, under beds, behind pictures on the wall, book case. If something can get pushed over, its going to. So dont hide things there. Lets get wiser. Lets start with the laundry room. Do your cabinets go all the way to the ceiling? If not, consider a fascia piece and Velcro or screws to hold it in place. Now, they look like they go to the ceiling and you have a lot of storage. The same with a toe kick piece on the bottom of cabinets. Remove it, and reattach with Velcro, magnets, or screws. Most cabinets also have an overhang on the bottom and top. You can fit a flush (horizontal) top or bottom and have a lot of storage. On washing machines and dryers, especially older models, there is a lot of dead space that can be accessed by removing the paneling. Obviously, be careful of what you are storing there, and the machines effects on it and its effect on the machine. How many hoses and vents come off of your washer and dryer? Would a looter notice an extra 6 vent piece on the back of your dryer? Do you use powdered laundry detergent? You can hide a lot in the bottom of a five gallon bucket of powder or large box of tide. Same thing with bleach. Empty a bleach container, wash, dry, and fill with goods. Store in the back behind a couple other full bottles of bleach.

THE KITCHEN: How many decorative containers do you have on the cabinets in your kitchen? Try putting food storage in them. How about under your stove? How about in the warming drawer? What about the vent above your stove? Remove the fascia piece on the bottom of your dishwasher? Do your cabinets have dead space around corners? Do your counters have an overhanging lip? Could you flush mount a thin veneer under them? Some of the more amazing hiding places I have seen constructed involved water filters. One was a screw in water filter in the fridge that was hollowed out. The other was an under the sink water filter, again, that was just the shell and had been hollowed out. It is easy to overlook these, and if the power and water is off, its easy to excuse them not working. It Is also easy to install an extra piece or two of PVC pipe under a sink that are going nowhere. Unless you take the time to look, most will not notice an extra pipe. How many chemicals do you keep under your sink? Can you store something in your ajax container? How about where you store all of your plastic bags? Be careful of hiding things in food (IE bottom of rice bucket.) Depending on how bad things are and who is doing the looting, that may be what people are looking for. How about your pantry? What about installing a 2 inch shelf above the door jam on the inside? How many times have you seen the wall above your closet door from the inside? Exactly .that is what makes it a great place to hide things. Depending on how small the pantry is and how high your ceiling is, you can go so far as to install a false ceiling. Because the lighting is usually different or non existent in the pantry/closet, false ceiling are a lot harder to pick out. Put a 2×4 so the 4 side is vertical on either short edge of the ceiling. Cut a piece of plywood to fit, and screw into the 2×4. 3.5 of storage space will fit most guns. Paint and texture to match. This works very well for a long term cache, when you can tape/caulk the seams, etc, and just leave it alone. How about a decorative backsplash behind a sink or stove? Can you use one to hide a between the studs cache in the wall? How about the inside of chandelier glass? Or screw in light covers? Add lots of dead bugs to hide any shadows cast. How about where your ceiling fan attached to the ceiling? Or your smoke alarm? If you take them out, you have access to a lot of space under your ceiling insulation, and can put back a functioning item to hide your entrance point. How about the dishes you have stacked up? How many coins could you tape to the bottom of your plates?

Moving on to the living room/dining room Couches make great, but obvious places to hide things. But how about a lamp base? How about a curtain rod? How about sewn into the fold on the bottom of a curtain? Can you install a false bottom on your dining chairs? How about your dining room table? Coffee table? Are there angled support pieces in the corners? If you do store stuff in a chair, be sure to pad the contents to keep them quiet, and do it to all of the chairs so it looks factory. How about speakers? When looking at furniture, try to figure out where the dead space is.

Then, figure out how you can build a compartment to take advantage of it. Indoor plants are great too. A nalgene bottle will hold a lot, and is waterproof enough to put in the bottom of a plant pot and leave under a plant and soil.

463324,"DIGG THIS

On the October 21 edition of the CBS news show, “Sunday Morning,” there was a segment on the history of the Maytag washing machine company. The company began producing washers in 1907 in Newton, Iowa. This week, the last floor employee at the nearly deserted Newton facility will be permanently laid off. Newton and Maytag have divorced. Reconciliation is unlikely due to irreconcilable differences.

The brand will bump along for a while longer. It may even recover its lost profitability. But it is now owned by Whirlpool, which bought the Maytag company in 2006 for $$1.7 billion.

The show interviewed workers who had been with the company their entire adult lives. Their careers are over. They will soon be facing the harsh realities of a retirement based on fixed incomes and rising prices.

What I found of much greater interest was this testimony from a more recent employee. “When I started working at the company 15 years ago, it was really hustling and bustling,” David Daehler said. “We was working 24/7 at the first plant I worked in. And we couldn’t put out enough product. Life was good. Four or five years ago things were really good with the company. And when things started going down, they really spiraled.” Here is a company that truly had things together for almost a hundred years. Yet in five years, it self-destructed. How? By cutting corners. Of all American companies, Maytag’s management should never have cut corners. “From the beginning, F.L. Maytag understood that delivering on the promise, putting his mouth where his money was, was really critical and he did that,” said Nancy Koehn, a brand historian at Harvard Business School. “There really isn’t another appliance that has that special place, that real estate if you will, in customers’ hearts and heads like Maytag.”

In just five years, Maytag’s senior managers squandered the company’s reputation. There is a lesson here.

MY MAYTAG EXPERIENCE

Early in our marriage, in 1976, my wife bought a used Maytag for (I recall), $$125. That was $$460 in today’s money. We moved that machine from Northern Virginia to North Carolina in 1977. From there, we moved to Texas in 1980. We still had that machine when we moved to Arkansas in 1998. It needed just three repairs in those 21 years, all minor. The paint had eroded off the settings dial, but the machine still worked fine. We left it behind when we moved to Arkansas in 2005. It still worked fine. We brought our back-up Maytag with us, bought used in 1998 for $$200. It also works fine.

That was Maytag’s reputation. It was reinforced by one of the most effective ad campaigns in television history: the lonely Maytag repairman. The famous Maytag repairman was veteran character actor Jesse White. White had a widely recognized face, but only movie buffs (or Stan Freberg skit buffs) knew who he was. His face was almost timeless, from Harvey (1950) to the Maytag repairman job. He held the position from 1967 to 1988. He was not the first Maytag repairman, but he is the one my generation remembers — and the generation that followed.

Then, sometime around 2000, things began to slide. The Web spread the word: Maytag’s Neptune front-loading washer was a stinker — literally. The following story was posted in 2005. It is still on-line. We were having dinner with our new neighbors the other day when talk turned to washing machines. Our Maytag had started making strange noises the Thursday before, and we were surprised that the lonely Maytag repairman couldn’t make it out to our house until the next Tuesday. Our neighbors, who had gotten a fancy Maytag Neptune washer and dryer set when they acquired their house, had found out that the Neptune washer had another well-deserved name, the “Stinkomatic.”

This morning I did a little Internet searching and happened upon maytagproblems.com. A little more searching led me to ConsumerAffairs.com where I learned that Maytag has just settled a class action lawsuit over the Neptune. This comment was typical of the complaints I saw. “The stench was awful,” said Anne of Treasure Island, Fla., in a complaint to ConsumerAffairs.Com. “I was told to wash the boot and the gasket in the door once a week. Use only a certain detergent. Wipe the door and the inside down with bleach once a week and then leave the door open for 2 hours after each washing.”

“I was washing my washer more than I was washing my laundry,” she said. That complaint was in stark contrast to the statement that I found in the Maytag Pressroom on their website. For the better part of a century, Maytag (TM) brand appliances have been synonymous with dependability and quality. Today, Maytag remains one of America’s most trusted appliance manufacturers. Based in Newton, Iowa, Maytag Appliances offers a full line of high-performance appliances.

The short-sighted managers who ran the company thought that a bland public relations statement on its Website, which affirmed the good old days, would overcome the company’s collapsing product quality, announced widely on the Web.

A year later, the company was bought out.

Here is a classic case of a deliberate violation of a USP: unique selling proposition. A unique selling proposition is that unique and original benefit that a product offers to consumers. If it can be encapsulated in a slogan, it becomes a cash cow. A famous USP is “Melts in your mouth, not in your hand.” I don’t have to identify the product, do I?

Maytag’s USP was reliability. It built its TV campaign around this theme from 1967 to 2007. But senior management decided to cut corners to save a few bucks. They allowed units to leave the factory that had major problems.

They did this in the era of the Web. They did not perceive that a true revolution had taken place, 1996 to 2000. They did not perceive that the Web would allow bad news to circulate by word of mouse. They did not perceive that disappointed buyers now had a way to get out the message. The message was clear: Maytag had abandoned reliability — its unique selling proposition.

The speed of consumer retaliation was very fast. As the former employee said, “We was working 24/7 at the first plant I worked in. And we couldn’t put out enough product. Life was good. Four or five years ago things were really good with the company. And when things started going down, they really spiraled.” In a very brief period, the company became unprofitable. Whirlpool moved in to take advantage of the crisis.

Whirlpool’s management believes that the Maytag brand can be restored. This is a huge gamble. Once lost, a USP is very difficult to restore.

CONSUMERS RUN THE SHOW

The idea that a great ad campaign can create a silk purse out of a sow’s ear is quite popular in tenured, market-immune academia, but sellers know better. Maytag’s ads proclaimed the same old story after 2000, but consumers were not fooled. They walked away from the brand by the millions. Another classic case of consumers’ absolute control over the profitability of a company is Schlitz beer. It was a mainstay of the beer industry three decades ago. It was second in market share only to Bud. It tried to save a few percentage points with a new, improved formula — improved for the accounting department. David Aaker, a professor of marketing at Berkeley, describes what happened. Executives often fail to recognize that delivering high quality is not enough to gain a marketplace advantage; there must be a perception among customers that high quality exists. Profits for the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Co. fell steadily, from $$48 million in 1974 to a negative $$50 million in 1979. In Schlitz’s Milwaukee plant in 1974, the “accelerated batch fermentation” process was finally put in production after 10 years of development. For some time the company had reduced costs by substituting corn syrup for barley malt. The fact that Schlitz was attempting to save money by going to less-expensive ingredients and processes was difficult to keep quiet and defend, especially since Anheuser-Busch Cos. had made the explicit decision to keep using the more expensive ingredients. In addition, Schlitz’s CEO died in 1977, and legal problems in 1978 led to the loss of 4 top marketing people. Still, the collapse of the Schlitz brand equity was caused largely by the loss of the perceived quality of the product. This loss turned out to be irreversible.

In 1982, Stroh’s Beer bought out Schlitz. It had taken Shlitz’s management less than a decade to destroy the company. “You only go around once in life,” a famous Schlitz commercial had proclaimed. This turned out to be true. In 1999, Stroh’s went out of the beer business after 150 years. It sold Schlitz to Pabst. Hardly anyone noticed.

If there is a rule that must not be violated it is quality control. It is better to hike the price than reduce quality. Why? Because of brand loyalty. The secret of success is repeat sales. This of course is far more true of beer than washing machines. Repeat business is everything. The existing client base must be courted. Word of mouth starts with this base. Put the consumers’ loyalty to the test for the sake of a few percentage points’ profit, and you risk the survival of the company. The loyal brand users return because the product meets their tastes and is predictable. Call into question this predictability, and you risk everything.

RECESSIONS AND COSTS

The great temptation of recessions is to cut costs by cutting quality. Profits fall, sales fall, and advertising doesn’t compensate for the decline. Word goes down the chain of command: “Cut costs!” The command is obeyed.

Schlitz took the plunge with its new formula in 1974, just as a recession was beginning. Managers refused to understand that the immediate fall in sales and profits was due mainly to the shift in brand loyalty. They thought it was due to the recession. By the time the recession ended in 1976, the damage had been done. The company sold to Stroh’s in the middle of the next recession.

The same thing happened to Maytag. It cut quality just as the recession began or immediately before. The fall in profits could be blamed on the recession of 2001. By the time the recession ended and the economy clearly was reviving, the company had established its new reputation: poor quality. Its USP was finished.

This practice is common. In January, 2003, I wrote an article about the lost vision at Dell Computer. I related the story of my experience with tech support, which Dell had moved to India. It was not a pleasant experience.

The following November, Dell cancelled its contract with its Indian tech support firm. This got a lot of bad publicity.

But Dell did not move customer support out of India. It just switched companies in India. The complaints are still coming from disgruntled buyers.

As for Dell’s share price, it is a bit less than half of what it was at the peak of the dot-com bubble in March, 2000. The company is unlikely ever to shake off its reputation for poor service. It gained this reputation years ago. Management seems to have factored consumer dissatisfaction into its business model. The share price reflects this.

The company made its decision to shift its customer support center to India in October, 2000, a few months before the 2001 recession began.

Its share price by then had collapsed by two-thirds. Management was pressured by this to find ways to restore the company’s fortunes. The move to India came just as the 2001 recession hit. Cost-cutting was on the front burner. The result has been what seems to be a permanent set-back for the company. I found no mention on the Web of a stock split since 2001, which would have lowered the price without lowering total capital gains to investors. There had been four splits in five years, 1992—97.

THE CASE FOR CASH

The time to make gains in market share is during a recession. The competition is scared. Revenue is falling. Plans are being re-thought. The advertising budgets are cut because increases in the budget do not gain increases in profitability.

When the competition moves into self-defense mode, an innovative firm with cash reserves can use advertising to increase its market share. This produces initial losses. Ad costs are not matched by rising revenues. But buyers will be attracted to the brand when they see the ads.

In recessions, people keep buying. They just don’t buy the same things as in booms. There is a shift from products that are desired when income is high to staples. Discretionary income shrinks.

At this point, companies that sell high-end niche products to wealthy people have a great advantage over companies that sell price-competitive, mass-produced items at Wal-Mart. People do cut back, though not as rapidly as their income falls. They borrow to keep spending. Their tastes do not change as fast as their income does.

In this shift from confident spending to cautious spending, the entrepreneur can make his move. He can secure a new customer at the expense of a competitor who did not see the signs of the recession.

MISES SHOWED THE WAY

When central bank monetary expansion ends, followed by slower growth in the monetary base, the economy slows. This is Ludwig von Mises’ insight in his theory of debased money. I have written a chapter on his theory of the boom-bust cycle.

We are now well into the disinflation stage on the cycle. Corporate managers who understand Mises should by now have moved from aggressive marketing to capital accumulation. Now is a good time to build cash, whether you are a corporate manager or an individual. The goal here is to have reserves when the fire sales begin. This will not take long. The setback has hit residential real estate. This has only just begun.

If your employer has been in cash-building mode for the last six months, this is a good sign.

You would be wise to take the signs of recession seriously.

CONCLUSION

There are no free lunches. There are no free booms. Booms are followed by busts.

In good times, prepare for bad times. Lay up reserves. In bad times, the grasshoppers who sang “The world owes me a living” all summer start selling their banjos for food. If you’re in the banjo business, you will get some great deals on inventory.

733453,"Senator John McCain, never one to play it close to the vest, has amped up his criticism of the Trump administration’s foreign policy, calling it a “half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.”

Quoted fully:

To fear the world we have organized and led for three quarters of a century, to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain “the last best hope of earth” for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.

It is almost impossible to comprehend this speech, delivered by McCain while receiving the National Constitution Center’s Liberty Medal for bipartisanship on Monday, without understanding his party and its neoconservative vision of American global hegemony.

Those who aren’t of the same persuasion as McCain, the Wall Street Journaleditorial page, and Bill Kristol’s Weekly Standard might be puzzled as to how the senator can get away with attacking American nationalism while at the same time calling for an American imperial mission. Exhorting one’s country to advance its ideals and leadership across the globe, even against the wishes of those who don’t want this guidance, sounds very much like vintage Western imperialism. French and British imperialists in the late nineteenth century were always justifying their imperial rule as a transmission belt for bringing their higher morality to unenlightened peoples and races.

Time to buy old US gold coins

Radical Republicans during the French Third Republic defended their country’s territorial penetration of Africa and Asia as efforts to carry their revolutionary principles across the seas. How does McCain’s vision differ from this imperialist mission proclaimed by Europeans before the First World War? By the late nineteenth century all European nationalists pursued empire in the name of universal egalitarian or progressive ideals—even the Italian fascist press invoked such concepts when Mussolini invaded Ethiopia in 1936.

The difference between them and us, at least as understood by McCain and his neoconservative friends, derives from their claim of moral superiority. They didn’t have it, McCain thinks, whereas we do. Unlike those morally defective empire builders of centuries past, McCain wants us to believe that we really do raise up the lowly and confused wherever we exert influence. Besides, we’re only practicing true imperialism, argues Stanley Kurtz of the Hoover Institution, if we directly rule a territory that we intend to control. No other form of control counts as imperialism, according to this fastidious definition. Finally, according to neoconservative teachings, it is only America haters who despise our universal values and propositional nationhood, and who therefore question our duty to civilize the entire planet. All this reminds me of a riddle that we used to pose jokingly when the neocons rose to prominence in the 1980s. “When is an empire not an empire?” The answer: “When neocons say it’s not.”

As a virtuous nation, according to the same authorities, we are not allowed to “refuse the obligation of global leadership,” for if we do, the world becomes a messier place. Supposedly, when we invaded Iraq in 2003, we were helping to make the globe less tumultuous. Moreover, whenever we engage in war, we are always fighting the bad guys because “democracies don’t fight each other.” Of course some liberty must be taken when we depict every country we’ve fought as “anti-democratic.” Was Finland in World War II an enemy of democracy? Or was that country a republican casualty of Soviet expansion that ended up in the Axis camp when we became allies of Stalin? World War I may offer another exception to the neocon rule, since the two sides didn’t look very different politically or culturally. And contrary to what I read in the Weekly Standard and other neoconservative publications, the Germans were not about to invade us when Wilson got Congress to declare war on them. I’m still trying to figure out how that intervention in 1917 and the very one-sided peace that followed made the world less messy.

book by investigative journalist Russ Baker, Family

of Secrets: The Bush Dynasty, The Powerful Forces That Put It In

The White House, And What Their Influence Means For America

(2009), performs a vital service by clarifying how intertwined oil,

Wall Street, intelligence and the Ivy League Universities are. These

are the ""powerful forces"" Baker identifies that rule America.

As Baker explains, the ""fundamentally amoral financial-intelligence-resource

apparatus"" antedates World War II: ""Before there was an

Office of Strategic Services (July 1942October 1945) or a

Central Intelligence Agency (founded in 1947), corporations and

attorneys who represented international businesses often employed

associates in their firms as private agents to gather data on competitors

and business opportunities abroad. So it was only to be expected

that many of the first OSS recruits were taken from the ranks of

oil companies, Wall Street banking firms, and Ivy League universities

and often equated the interests of their high-powered business partners

with the national interest"" (p. 17).

When referring

to a shadowy, collective entity like the ""ruling class,""

we need to deflect the slur of ""conspiracy theorist.""

Justin Raimondo put it best in his comment on the penetrating analysis

of Murray Rothbard: ""Here there is no single agency, no omnipotent

central committee that issues directives, but a multiplicity of

interest groups and factions whose goals are generally congruent.

In this milieu, there are familial, social, and economic connections,

as well as ideological complicity, and none is better than Rothbard

at ferreting out and unraveling these biographical details. Taken

together, the author’s small and studied brushstrokes paint a portrait

of a ruling class whose ruthlessness is surpassed only by its brazen

disloyalty to the nation"" (Murray Rothbard, Wall

Street, Banks, and American Foreign Policy, 1984).

The nature of the ruling class has never been portrayed more accurately.

Enter

Timothy Geithner, President Obama's ""new"" Treasury Secretary

who bravely announced a ""new"" trillion-dollar plan this

week for ""stabilizing the financial system"" yet, it turned

out, he had no plan to announce. Like his predecessor, the charming

and vivacious Hank Paulson from Goldman Sachs, the new non-plan

will be a monstrous bailout of Wall Street bankers at the expense

of the American people with a flimsy cover story about getting the

credit markets going again to speed economic recovery on behalf

of the American people. Geithner's flop on Tuesday proves that he

and his cronies are making it up as they go along in their attempts

to repair the unrepairable.

Who is Geithner?

He is a creature of the eastern banking establishment and ruling

class through and through. His rsum nicely matches his actions

in handing out government money and guarantees to the ""right

people."" Geithner's father Peter is director of the Asia program

at the Ford Foundation, a New World Order operation. Peter Geithner

oversaw the ""microfinance"" programs developed in Indonesia

by Ann Dunham-Soetoro, Barack Obama's mother. Geithner's maternal

grandfather, Charles F. Moore, was an adviser to President Eisenhower

and vice president of Ford Motor Company, according to Wikipedia.

Geithner's wife Carole Marie, like Geithner a 1983 graduate of Dartmouth

College (Ivy League), is daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Albert Sonnenfeld

of Princeton, N.J., a professor of French and comparative literature

at Princeton University (Ivy League) for 27 years.

After

Timothy Geithner graduated from Dartmouth he picked up an M.A. at

Johns Hopkins in something called ""international economics""

and East Asian studies. That is the extent of Geithner's formal

training in economics, as far as I can tell. Then he worked for

Kissinger and Associates for three years, a Rockefeller satrapy,

before a series of government appointments, mostly at Treasury where

he was Under Secretary for International Affairs under Robert Rubin

of Goldman Sachs and Rockefeller's notorious Council on Foreign

Relations (CFR) and then Lawrence Summers of Harvard University

(Ivy League), World Bank and CFR. Summers, of course, is currently

Obama's head of the National Economic Council. Want a solution for

the financial and economic woes? Why, hire the same experts who

caused the problem(s).

Geithner departed

Treasury to join the International Monetary Fund and CFR in 20012.

In October 2003 he was appointed president of the New York Fed where

he subsequently arranged rescues of Bear Stearns, AIG and other

well-connected, world-class losers, all in the best interest of

the American people, of course.

Geithner is

change? A better slogan would be ""continuity"" or more

of the same. Perhaps we should call the new ""stabilization""

spending PP: ""Plunder for Plutocrats,"" for that is what

it is. This folly cannot persist, if only because someday there

will be little or nothing left to plunder.

As you know, weve been wondering about the exhaustion of the Industrial Revolution innovation and the bankruptcy of the Social Welfare state as a result.

Our investments depend on it too; we buy investments that we hope will become more valuable as sales and profits grow along with the economy. But what if all of our assumptions about what is normal are wrong? What if the growth spurt we have known for the last 300 years was the exception, not the rule? And what if it were now coming to an end?

We traveled to Switzerland yesterday. What a great town Zurich is! Clean prosperous charming. And last night, it seemed like there were more people enjoying the warm May evening than there were townspeople. The sidewalk cafes, restaurants and bars were overflowing. Everyone was outside strolling chatting drinking. The Swiss must have it made.

Well, yes, its a great place to live. But not if you live on a salary, a banker explained. There are so many Germans moving here  because its a beautiful city and because people leave you alone here  prices have gone up. An ordinary citizen can hardly afford to live in Zurich anymore. And when I walk down the Bahnhofstrasse I rarely hear our local language spoken. I hear High German, or Russian, or Turkish, or English.

We can confirm that prices are high. Not by DSK standards, but high for us. Our hotel near the train station was not particularly fancy. But our modest room still cost about $700 a night.

Our friend Rolf Dobelli of getAbstract interviewed us. He challenged our end of progress theory.

Its hardly a theory, we covered our tracks. Its just an idea. We dont know if we believe it. Or like it. Were just trying it on to see how it fits.

Yes, but people take ideas seriously. They might have come to the same conclusion in 1979, he said. They might have thought that the boom years were over then. But as it turned out, there were still huge growth dividends to be paid  principally from electronic communications and the efficiency gains they bring.

Maybe, we replied. But most of the above-trend, real growth since 1979 has been in the energy economies, that are still increasing their energy use per person. The mature economies have realized incremental improvements since then, but much of that was phony  driven by increases in debt and government spending. And its not clear that advances in communications bring real wealth improvements. Think of the television. Its been around for more than half a century. It has probably actually depressed wealth since then. Now, with all those emails to answer and Facebook and Twitter to keep up with it could be that they are more of a nuisance than a wealth-producer.

Its like anything else. You get the big gains in the beginning. You invent a bow and arrow, for example. You hunt more effectively. Then, you can improve it. But there are only so many improvements you can make. After the bow and arrow, humans waited a long time  with little or no progress  until the firearm was invented. And note that guns, like every other major forward move in human history, were effectively a way of using more energy. You sent a projectile further, faster by drawing on condensed energy sources. Broadly, energy is wealth. The more you use, the richer you are.

But what about conservation measures efficiency gains? Most European nations have stabilized or even reduced their use of energy in recent years.

Thats my point. You get big productivity and wealth gains from the first increments of oil-based energy. Then, you eventually reach a point of diminishing returns, where gains are few. You become more efficient. You become better at using it. But your growth levels off too.

Were seeing a reflection of this in population figures. Fertility rates are high in the emerging economies  where energy use is increasing rapidly. They are low in countries where energy use is topping out. In Germany and Japan  probably among the worlds most efficient energy users  there has been zero population growth for the last 10 years. And now, the population in Japan is actually falling. The Japanese economy is collapsing too. Its gone nowhere for 20 years, and now  in the first quarter of this year  its shrinking at a 3.7% rate.

As countries use more energy their birth rates decline. Im not sure there is a cause and effect link, but thats what happens. It is as if people knew, subconsciously, that they are reaching the limits of their new, oil-fired habitat. The latest population estimates show world population still rising but at a slower and slower rate until growth comes to an end in about 2050 with about 9 million people on the planet. Most likely, that is about when gains from additional energy inputs level off too.

Meanwhile, the news yesterday brought nothing special. US stocks rose a bit. Oil remained below $100  still three times what it was 5 years ago. Gold fell to $1,492.

The Fed pumps in more and more money. Stocks float. But key parts of the US economy are made of lead. Housing and unemployment, mainly. The New York Times tells us today that debt-burdened college graduates are having a much harder time finding suitable work. And when they do find a job, the starting salary will be an average of 10% lower than it was 5 years ago  not including inflation.

Even when new jobs are created, theyre rarely the middle class jobs that can support the housing market. So more than 1 out of every 4 homeowners is underwater with more sinking every day.

Curiously, many of these drowning homeowners are actually helping to support the consumer economy. More than 4 million of them arent making regular mortgage payments. The typical foreclosed mortgage hasnt been serviced in more than 17 months. That leaves millions of people in houses they arent paying for giving them more money to spend.

Excerpted from his book Experiments in Moral Sovereignty.

Here is an extract from a poem by Pablo Neruda that Harold Pinter quoted in his Nobel Lecture in December 2005. Pinter made profoundly disturbing remarks about American and British conduct in the Iraq War. He quoted Neruda’s poem about Spain to make an image of the deliberate bombing of civilians by States as has been their characteristic throughout the past century.

“And one morning all that was burning,

one morning the bonfires

leapt out of the earth

devouring human beings

and from then on fire,

gunpowder from then on,

and from then on blood.

Bandits with planes and Moors,

bandits with finger-rings and duchesses,

bandits with black friars spattering blessings

came through the sky to kill children

and the blood of children ran through the streets

without fuss, like children’s blood.

Jackals that the jackals would despise

stones that the dry thistle would bite on and spit out,

vipers that the vipers would abominate.

Face to face with you I have seen the blood

of Spain tower like a tide

to drown you in one wave

of pride and knives.

From every house burning metal flows

instead of flowers

and from every dead child a rifle with eyes

and from every crime bullets are born

which one day will find

the bull’s eye of your hearts.

And you will ask: why doesn’t his poetry

speak of dreams and leaves

and the great volcanoes of his native land.

Come and see the blood in the streets.

Come and see

the blood in the streets.

This poem — I’m Explaining a Few Things — was written at about the midpoint of the bloodiest century in known human history. Much more blood would be spilled before century’s end. This was the so-called “American Century.” The century of the Nuclear Nation State. The century when the power of science and technology began to double at the rate of geometric progression. In the womb of this century was conceived the current American policy of “Full Spectrum Dominance,” to be imposed upon others by “Shock and Awe” of death raining from the sky.

“Force is that which turns a person into a thing — either a corpse or slave.”

~ Simone Weil

Gandhi wrote, “The individual has a soul, but as the State is a soulless machine, it can never be weaned from the violence to which it owes its very existence.” Others have noted, “War is the health of the State.”

“States are not agents of morality and peace. They are instruments of force, disruption, disorder, death, dismemberment, and war instigated by those who rule them and command others. Peace is not brought by bombardment, shock and awe, and machine guns.”

~ M.S. Rozeff, 29 October 2005

War Is The Ultimate Profession of Nice Government Men

War is the ultimate profession of government. War is always debt financed. To find the ultimate “beneficiaries” of war, follow the money trail to its creditors. If a State can successfully involve itself in war, it will survive. If it cannot, it will perish. The sanctity of law, the well-being of citizens, and the solvency of its treasury will be sacrificed by any government in its primal struggle for survival. It is therefore in the self-interest of politicians and financiers to involve the State in war, or to create perceived threat of war. The greater the threat, the more massive the war preparation, the greater the need for debt finance.

To involve the State in war, it is necessary to have an enemy. If such already exist, provoke. If not existing, create one by financing the rise of a hostile regime or non-state hostile actor.

The best assurance of peace, as also the greatest obstacle to those who would profit from war, is a government which refuses to finance war via debt. When this occurs, it is in the interest of world debt financiers to encourage regime change in such State so as to install a government more compliant to their goals. This game has been made evident by the American game of overt or covert overthrow of foreign governments (sometimes for “captive oil” in lieu of outright war).

A global condition of perpetual war is the best assurance of continual profit for the financiers thereof. Since they profit from financing both (or all) sides, their interest is in a balance of power, pursuant to which no participant gains a decisive victory. If through exhaustion or victory there is a temporary peace, there will be a reduction of debt. Reduction of debt results in loss of profit form the military-industrial complex and its financiers.

It can be seen from the foregoing that the “War on Terror” is perfectly elegant in its design to accomplish the goal of Everywhere Forever War. There cannot be a decisive victory. It is perpetual. It is very profitable for a few.

The success of its methodology is documented by US Department of Defense studies pointed out by Ivan Eland of the Independent Institute. These studies show that the presence of heavy concentrations of US troops, positions or activity in some part of the world is closely correlated with increased terrorist activity. It is obvious that the presence of a foreign power, even if “benevolent,” will breed local resentment. (Tim Case, 16 December 2005).

“They have always taught and trained you to believe it will be your patriotic duty to go to war and to have yourselves slaughtered at their command. But in all the history of the world you, the people, have never had a voice in declaring war.”

~ Eugene Debs

The State Monopoly on the Use of Force

The overt power of the State is its monopoly on the use of force within a given territorial area. This monopoly is ostensibly to provide for the safety and security of its citizens. Leaving aside the historical fact that this set-up amounts to a legalized protection racket, how did States perform in the twentieth century on their responsibility to protect citizens? Please note that I am not embarking upon an argument from efficiency. The concern is with moral issues.

“The State lies in all the tongues of good and evil, and whatever it says is lies, and whatever it has, it has stolen, everything it is, is false, it bites with stolen teeth, and it bites often, it is false down to its bowels.”

~ Friedrich Nietzsche, 1896

Partial reports of the blood-soaked ledger are presented in two recent monographs cited and abstracted in the following. In considering the background and motivation of these conflicts, note that war is always tax and debt financed. Note who benefits from tax and debt finance: power brokers in government, central and commercial bankers, the military-industrial complex. Consider who it is that has the power of war and peace in a sham democracy controlled by corporations. Note the immutable linkage of means to end discussed elsewhere in this booklet. War can never bring peace, or prosperity, or any good outcome. War is murder.

War results in immense transfers of wealth from the many to a few powerful decision-makers, financiers, industrialists and bankers. Other than this massive transfer of wealth and power, one is confronted with the question: what did these conflicts accomplish, and for whom?

Title: Deaths in Wars and Conflicts in the 20th Century / Netherlands Institute of International Relations / Leitenberg, M. / 1 August 2006.

“An itemized sum for deaths in wars and conflicts ‘killed or allowed to die by human decision’ of approximately 231 million for the 20th Century. Some of the components are:

World war I, between 13 and 15 million

Armenian Genocide of 1915, 1 million

Russian Civil War of 1918-1922, over 12.5 million

Mexican Revolution of 1909-1916, 1 million

Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939, 600,000

Various colonial and other wars pre-1914, approximately 1.5 million

World War II, between 65 and 75 million

Conflicts between 1945-2000, 41 million

“Additional components include politically caused deaths of the USSR from the forced starvation in Ukraine and among “kulaks” in the 1930’s and the forced deaths of the gulag labor camps during various Soviet purges reported at 35 million killed by political terror or deliberate starvation. The starvation program was intended to destroy the independent Russian peasantry and replace them with agricultural collectives. In 1990, Antonov-Ovseenko estimated starvation deaths at 22 million during 1932-33 alone. In 1986, M. Walker reported Soviet figures of 18,840,000 arrested in political purges between 1935-41, with 7 million shot directly. In 1990 and 1994 Rummel published estimates of 61,911,000 Soviet genocides and mass murders between 1917-1987. In 1983 Dr. Alex Inkles attributed the loss of 100 million Russian lives to Lenin and Stalin.

“For China, detailed figures of mortality during successive “rectification campaigns” have been published by the Chinese government. These campaigns include the land reform movement (1949-54) / “suppression of counterrevolutionaries” (1949-54) / “Anti-Rightists Campaign” (1959) / Great Leap Forward starvation (1959-61) / “Cultural revolution” (1965-75) / Additional deaths in labor camps during Cultural Revolution. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences reports 80 million ‘killed or allowed to die by human decision’ for this period.

“For the regimes of USSR, China, North Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Afghanistan, and East European states under communist rule between 1950 and 1990, an estimated up to 100 million people were killed by these governments collectively. In addition, the North Korean gulags killed 400,000 between 1970 and 2000, and the government-induced famines of late 1990’s resulted in up to 2,650,000 deaths.

“Cambodian conflicts between 1975 and 1978 killed 2 million.

“The next significant category is ‘the great domestic slaughters,’ tabulated from 1955. For these the total is 15 million, with 13 out of 19 events taking place in Africa. Other significant events were in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Iraq-Kurds, Bosnia-Yugoslavia.

“The widely-invoked phrase of ‘Never Again’ following the WWII Holocaust — which could be considered an historic vow — proved to be empty rhetoric and bankrupt as a policy upon which any State was prepared to act.”

Table 2 of the report tabulates deaths in wars and conflicts for 1945-2000. Some extracts are noted in following quotations:

“In reviewing the history of the English Government, its wars and its taxes, a bystander would declare that taxes were not raised to carry on wars, but wars were raised to carry on taxes.”

~ Thomas Paine

Title: Development, Democracy and Mass Killings / World Bank and New York University / William Easterly, 1 August 2006.

“Abstract: The 20th Century closed with many lamenting civilian killings by the State as its greatest evil. By one estimate, governments killed as many as 170 million civilians from 1900-1987, more than all the soldiers killed in wars of the 20th Century. The century closed with a new euphemism for killing and deportation: ‘ethnic cleansing.’ Freedom from risk of being killed by the state, and freedom from having your ‘group’ being the target of violence is surely an important component of social well-being. Power kills — absolute power kills absolutely. Democracies can also engage in massacre and genocide. A majority may agree on the killing of an unpopular minority. Famous examples are the democratic governments of Australia, Canada and the United States who killed indigenous peoples. It is an open empirical question whether democracy turns economic development toward benevolent ends.” (my emphasis)

Appendix 2 List of Mass Killing Episodes. From a list of 174 episodes, only a few are noted below:

Bangladesh 1979-99, massacre of tribals

Brazil 1988-92, massacre of tribals

Chile 1986, massacre of tribals

China 1959-79, occupation of Tibet (1,200,000 deaths)

Columbia, 1991, mass killings of tribals

Guatemala 1960-96, mass murder of indigenous groups (200,000)

India 1992-93, Hindu-Muslim riots

Indonesia 1976-87, East Timor massacres (230,000)

Papua New Guinea 1988-91, massacre of indigenous groups

Paraguay 1990-91, massacre of indigenous groups

Romania 1989-93, ethnic cleansing

USA and Canada, pre twentieth century genocide of indigenous population

War Consumes Civilians

“Democracies are prone to war, and war consumes them.”

~ W.H. Seward in Eulogy on John Quincy Adams (1848)

“Half a century has shown that exaggerated nationalism is so perilous as to place in question man’s very survival.”

~ Albert Einstein in Man and His Gods, 1952

Attention is invited to the death ratio of civilians versus military. One hundred seventy million of the total 231 million are civilian non-combatants, leaving 61 million as military casualties. Civilian casualties were nearly three times that of the military. Leave aside the moral obscenity of these State-sponsored conflicts, the figures provide a stark measure of the efficacy of the State in carrying out its supposedly primary function of providing security for its citizens.

The following statistics for India have come from internet sources. Their reliability cannot be vouchsafed. Nonetheless, from my sixteen years of reading the daily Indian press, I think the trend and the political realities are not misrepresented.

“Mortalities at hands of Indian government include over 250,000 Sikh men, women and children since 1984; 300,000 Christians in Nagaland and elsewhere; 90,000 Muslims in Kashmir; tens of thousands of Assamese, Bodos, Dalits, Manipuris, Tamils and other minorities. It is reported that more than 52,000 Sikhs remain imprisoned without charge or trial under TADA, an Act which expired in 1995. According to Amnesty International, tens of thousands of other minorities are also being held as political prisoners.”

The purpose of presenting these disturbing statistics of State action is to help awaken us from what I perceive to be mass psychological denial of the facts of our situation. Based upon the facts of its record of action and upon perceptions of its real driving forces, I would raise questions about the moral validity of the State as an institutional frame upon which to organize a civil human society.

“Money rules the world. With power to control the money supply, you control the world. That’s just reality. Politicians all succumb to the powers that be. Once initiated, their options become clear. Either expose the ruse and commit political suicide while potentially collapsing the economy, or play the banker’s game by the banker’s rules. Politicians are the puppets, not the puppet masters.”

~ Chuhran, 26 April 2004

What is the moral justification for the existence, let alone the tolerance, of an institution which not only cannot protect women and children, but oppresses and murders selectively those within its own borders?

“War is a racket. It always has been. It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is has international scope. It is the only one in which profits are reckoned in dollars and losses in lives. A racket is best described as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only a small ‘inside’ group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the vary many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes.”

~ twice decorated Congressional Medal of Honor Marine Major General Smedley Butler,

War Is A Racket, 1935

Here are some glimpses of American action while “conquering” the peaceful people of the Philippines in March, 1906. Six hundred US soldiers with artillery massacred more than six hundred Moro men, women and children who had taken shelter in a volcanic crater. The Americans fired into the bowl of the crater from protected positions at the lip above. A few Moro had knives and sticks. Excerpts from US newspapers of the day: “Women Slain In Moro Slaughter” / “With Children They Mixed in Mob in Crater, and All Died Together” / “Death List Is Now 900.”

“They were mere naked savages, and yet there is a sort of pathos about it when that word children falls under your eye, for it always brings before us our perfectest symbol of innocence and helplessness; and by help of its deathless eloquence color, creed and nationality vanish away and we see only that they are children — merely children. We see a picture. We see they are frightened and crying and in trouble, our pity goes out to them by natural impulse. We see the small forms. We see terrified faces. We see the tears. We see small hands clinging in supplication to the mother.”

~ Voices of a People’s History of the United States, Howard Zinn

Old News in a Continuing Tragedy

12 October 2006. Just released from John’s Hopkins University, a report estimates that between 420,000 to 790,000 Iraqis have died as result of war since US invasion in March 2003. Almost a million have been displaced or have fled the country. Add to this the earlier deaths of 500,000 children caused by sanctions — which US Secretary of State brazenly stated in public “Is worth the price” — and you have a feel for the “benevolence” of democracy.

Juan Cole (Informed Comment) notes that this report will have a “hard ride” because a significant portion of the US business elite is very invested in the Iraq War. He asks, “Can you imagine the profits of the military-industrial complex from all of this? Do they really want the US public to know the truth about what the weapons they produce have done to Iraqis? Who is really benefiting from this?”

“The world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes.”

~ Benjamin Disraeli

“The question of power, and consequently of war, is little else than a question of money. Those who stand ready to furnish this money are the real rulers. The so-called sovereigns of States are nothing more than tools employed by the wealthy. They are simply the chiefs of different bands of robbers and murderers. And these chiefs are dependent upon the lenders of blood-money for the means to carry on their robberies and murders.”

~ Lysander Spooner, 1870

A report by Dr. Javed Jamil, Who Is Bigger Threat to World Peace: Iran or Big Five?, February 2006, offers statistical precedent on the behavior of powerful central governments, quoted roughly as follows. His list of wars of the past 150 years indicates that 84% of mortalities have been at the hands of five of today’s major military powers: China, USA, Russia, UK and France. The biggest pogroms of history have taken place in Germany and Russia — both Christian — and China, of mixed religions and communist atheism. Two of the biggest killers of all time, Stalin and Hitler, were Christians. The largest number of murders within their own countries for political ends was carried out by governments of China and Russia. The shame of killing the most people abroad goes to USA, especially during the past 60 years. Apart from WWII battlefield deaths, it murdered about 500,000 civilians in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, almost three million in Vietnam, and up to now an estimated up to 790,000 in Iraq. Dr. Jamil notes that Iran, presently in the nuclear bomb sights of USA, appears only once in his list of ninety one wars, and has never waged a war of aggressive invasion against another. He does not mention the Nixon-Kissinger murder of hundreds of thousands women and children incinerated by US napalm bombs in non-combatant Cambodia.

“Take not life, which God has made sacred.”

~ The Qur’an

“The highest charity is refraining from violence.”

~ Srimad Bhagavatam

Dr. Jamil does not directly mention the absurdity of the world’s most rampant terrorist organization — the US government — conducting a “war on terror.” Since 1946, the USG has overthrown some 50 governments, often by terrorist means, sometimes by a clandestine assassination.

“US forces and policies are completing the radicalization of the Islamic world, something Osama bin Laden has been trying to do with substantial but incomplete success since the early 1990’s. As a result, it is fair to conclude that the United States of America remains bin Laden’s only indispensable ally.”

~ Noam Chomsky Amnesty International Lecture, 18 January 2006

The Federation of American Scientists has compiled a list of over 201 overseas military operations from end of WWII to 11 September 2001 in which the USG was involved and normally struck the first blow. He list is reprinted by Gore Vidal in Perpetual War for Perpetual peace: How We Got To Be So Hated. The USG helped install and then supported such dictators as the Shah of Iran, General Suharto in Indonesia, Fulgencio Batista in Cuba, Anastasio Somoza in Nicaragua, Augusto Pinochet in Chile, and Sese Mobutu in Congo-Zaire, as well as a series of American-backed militarists in Vietnam and Cambodia until finally expelled from Indochina. (Chalmers Johnson, On Peddling Democracy)

Reckless in Washington

The US has been capable of both Hiroshima and Vietnam. Which one will it be this time?

Indian Express 19 August 2005

For me, what this headline does not say is a devastating critique of our sorry situation. It asks, “Which one will it be this time?” Which modality of death will America choose with which to murder women and children? It does not ask might there be restraint of greed, respect for the rights and lives of others, goodwill in voluntary exchange, peaceful relations among neighbors. It holds no hope for peace. It asks only what will be the style of war, what is the weapon of choice this time with which to destroy the lives of innocent people who pose no threat.

“Nevertheless, the first task of the Iraqi occupation remains the first task of government — to establish a monopoly on violence.”

~ George Will, Washington Post, April 2004

What man would voluntarily provide 40% of his earnings to support such obscene atrocities as mentioned so far? The sweat of my labor is not meant to become shards of depleted uranium in the mangled body of an infant crying for its dead mother. If not voluntary, then taxes are coercion, violence. Is this not slavery?

“The trade of governing has always been monopolized by the most ignorant and the most rascally individuals of mankind.”

~ Thomas Paine (1737-1849)

I am reminded, ruefully and too often, of humorist Will Rogers, “Good that we don’t get all the government that we pay for.” It looks to me that if the governments of 21st Century actually deliver all that we have paid for, surely we will all be killed.

“If the government can take a man’s money without his consent, there is no limit to the additional tyranny it may impose upon him. With his money, it can hire soldiers to keep him in subjection, plunder him at discretion and kill him if he resists.”

~ Lysander Spooner, 1852

The financial function of the State is clear. This is to coerce money and resources from people that could not have been obtained by voluntary exchange in the marketplace. The end of Power is to exercise authority over others concerning money and resources that can be exploited for monetary benefit. Calls of “democracy-freedom-patriotism-proletariat-general welfare-the constitution-fatherland-war on terror,” are all intended as propaganda to extract money or labor from a conditioned people. The aim of power is control. The aim of control is power.

“In order to get power and retain it, it is necessary to love power. Love of power is not connected with goodness, but with qualities that are opposite of goodness, such as pride, cunning and cruelty.”

~ Leo Tolstoy

“Power intoxicates men. When a man is intoxicated by alcohol, he can recover. But when intoxicated by power, he seldom recovers.”

~ James F. Byrnes

“Power is the greatest aphrodisiac.”

~ Henry Kissinger

Next after the family, perhaps the most fundamental social institution is the market — the meeting ground of human beings in voluntary exchange of goods and services. The weakness of the market is the presence of people willing to use violence rather than voluntary exchange, and those who are willing to breach their exchange agreements. Governments are called upon to use their monopoly of force to settle market disputes. The mistaken perception arises that this institution which employs violence is a good thing, whereas the market — the system of voluntary social cooperation — although necessary, is perhaps not good.

What has evolved out of this is the system of fiat currency in which the government has the right to declare what is money and to manufacture this money. This allows the government to debase its currency through printing press inflation. This leads to destruction of the currency’s utility and to its eventual repudiation as a medium of exchange. The money power also means the government determines the meaning of private contracts.

A government which manufactures and owns money and forces it to be the only legal tender can remove all rights of the people simply by inflation through printing press additions to the money supply. In this way it can expand government spending to do whatever it wishes, for example invade a foreign country, without the consent of the people. Money earned is one index by which to measure the amount of my life expended. Therefore, inflation is tantamount to loss of life, starvation-by-embezzlement. It also breeds the moral hazard of excessive debt, knowing that dollars when repaid will be of less value than at the time of loan initiation.

If inflation is an incremental starvation of the individual, it is tantamount to gasoline on the fire of worldwide ecological destruction. Major central banks such as the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan — often working in concert — depress the interest rate below the natural risk premium in order to stimulate the economy. Even when they raise interest rates in response to public perception of inflation, they print more money and flood the economy with “new money.” This results in serious distortions and irrational investments. It encourages huge, chaotic and wild speculation and waste. The vast pool of paper liquidity stimulates business far beyond normal, actual, rational demand. It permits the so-called “carry trade,” pursuant to which funds can be borrowed at a negative real rate of interest, that is a rate below the actual rate of inflation. This in turn results in burning our ecology in a fire of greed.

“The few who understand the system…will either be so interested in its profits or so dependent on its favors that there will be no opposition from that class, while on the other hand, the great body of people, mentally incapable of comprehending…will bear its burden without complaint.”

~ A communique from Rothschilds in England to associates

in New York regarding the Federal Reserve System

Every kind of human arrangement is connected in some way or other to money payments. If the monetary system is destroyed, the basis of all human relations is also in some sense destroyed. When governments destroy the market, they in turn destroy human cooperation and peaceful human relations. Currency depreciation enriches the State and those who control it. It allows the State to finance foreign interventions and all manner of mischief without imposing new taxes. This is theft on a grand scale. It destroys human relations through The Lie. War ensues. By a series of emergency proclamations, the government becomes a dictatorship.

Pursuant to the system of manufactured money, it becomes itself an “asset” rather than a temporary unit as medium of exchange. This creates mischief in the function of the market as a natural venue of exchange An “asset” that itself can be bought and sold in speculation, it is divorced from the work product of the human body and leads to divorce from nature as source of our sustenance. Alienation from nature results in psychic disconnection from our own self and from others, disrupting our interdependency and leading to the anomie so evident in society.

“By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens … and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some … The hidden process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million will be able to diagnose.”

~ The Economic Consequences of Peace, John M. Keynes, 1919

All protection given to individuals by constitutions and bills of rights is extinguished when the State has power to destroy the meaning of inter-human relations by undermining the system of money and exchange which is called the market. This is violence. The perpetrators sitting in legislative halls are immunized from consequences of their actions, protected by sovereign immunity. Thus the nominal function of State — to provide security to citizens — is violated by the State itself. A prime example of this is the confiscation of all private citizen gold by President Roosevelt in 1933, followed by an immediate government-decreed increase in price of gold amounting to about 20% reduction in purchasing power of the dollar. There was no way for the citizen to protect himself against this grand theft.

“Give me control of a nation’s money and I care not who makes the laws.”

~ Mayer Rothschild

“The best way to destroy the capitalist system is to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens.”

~ Lenin

“The power to tax involves the power to destroy.”

~ Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall

My personal experience is that being forced to rely on a man-made system — arbitrary and gorged on corruption as it is — generates anxiety, frustration and resentment. The more distant and tenuous is one’s connection to earth and the web of life, the greater is the tendency to insecurity.

From the premise that an individual has an inalienable right to life, it follows that he must have an indisputable right to the product of his labor. This is the most basic property right. The absolute right to the product of one’s labor follows from the right to life because one without the other is meaningless. The means to stay alive must be identified with life itself. If the State has a prior right to the product of my labor, it has usurped my right to life. In addition to this, if the State uses my taxes for war, it has robbed me of my moral agency. It has violated my soul.

“Remember democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide.”

~ John Adams, 15 April, 1814

Borrowing from the work of Frank Chodorov (Taxation Is Robbery, 1962), I add his thoughts to my personal experience. But first, Gandhi: any end is determined by its means. A historical study of taxation leads to a mess of iniquity. The practice originated as looting, tribute, ransom — the economic purposes of conquest. The barons who put up toll gates along the Rhine were tax-collectors. So were the gangs who “protected,” for a forced fee, the caravans on their way to market. These taxations served only to keep a privileged class in comfort and finance their internecine wars. These, like all taxes, amount to a permission-to-live price.

As between indirect tax (attached to goods before they reach the consumer) and direct taxes, the latter is most vicious, for it is a direct taking of one’s labor product. The direct tax proclaims the prior right of the State to all private property. Private property becomes a temporary and revocable stewardship. The Jeffersonian ideal of inalienable rights is thus extinguished. Substituted for it is the Marxist concept of State supremacy.

“All politics is grounded in lies, deceits, cover-ups and distortions of reality.”

~ Butler Shaffer, 2 November 2005

A Vortex of Immorality

A basic immorality becomes the center of a vortex of immoralities. When the State abolishes the right of the individual to the product of his labor, it appropriates an authority which is contrary to the natural man. It thus establishes an unethical pattern of behavior, both for itself and those upon whom it exerts its coercion. The denial of ownership of one’s labor — tantamount to denial of self-ownership — arouses a resentment which manifests as perjury and dishonesty. Who among us has been totally sincere and enthusiastic in filling up an income tax form? Men who in their personal affairs would never condone such methods are proud of and are complimented for evasion of income tax laws. It is considered proper to engage the shrewdest minds for the purpose. More degrading is the encouragement by bribes of mutual spying. No other measure in the history of the country has caused such a complete disregard of principle in public affairs, or has had such a deteriorating effect on morals.

The evolution of political exploitation has followed a general pattern: hit-and-run robbery, regular tribute, slavery, rent-collections. In the final stage, rent collections become the primary proceeds of exploitation. The political power is supported by levies on production. The citizen lives for the State which nurtured him. He belongs to the State by right of purchase. Natural man knows by conscience and intuition that he has right of free and unencumbered ownership of the product of his efforts. Observe any family member when another snatches what is “mine.”

There cannot be a good tax, or a just tax. Every tax is a compulsion, a violation of person.

Through a process of continuous propaganda beginning in very early childhood and extending with great intensity through twelve years of compulsory public education, we are brainwashed to the point that many cannot see these fundamental relationships.

“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested largely by men we have never heard of. The invisible government tends to be concentrated in the hands of the few because of the expense of manipulating the social machinery which controls the opinions and habits of the masses. It is not generally realized to what extent the words and actions of our most influential public men are dictated by shrewd persons operating behind the scenes.”

The ethics scandals that continuously roil all three branches of the US and Indian governments, as well as scandals of the corporate-government nexus involving war profiteering, adulteration of products, destruction of environment, misappropriation of land, embezzlement and breach of contract are simply too numerous to catalog. There are large numbers of legislators under indictment in both USA and India. Since I am discussing the State in generic form, I’ll use some of the data from India because it is more accessible. Data from internet news sources regarding presently sitting members of Parliament of India indicate that 29 have been accused of spousal abuse, 7 have been arrested for fraud, 19 have more than three criminal cases pending, 117 have been charged and are under investigation for murder, rape, assault, extortion or robbery, 71 are in default of loans, 21 are current defendants in various lawsuits and 84 have been involved in offenses for which they paid fines.

“It is the big bureaucrats and the corporates who are more corrupt than the poorest of the poor. Corruption has nothing to do with poverty. It has everything to do with greed.”

“A Q Khan, father of Pakistan’s nuclear black market, will remain off-limits to the Americans. That’s because Khan has Musharraf by the short hairs, having hidden evidence of Musharraf’s complicity in nuclear deals with Iran, North Korea and Khan alone knows who else.”

~ Ramananda Sengupta, rediff news, April 2005

As will be discussed in material to follow, this all-too-typical game of political blackmail shows how national and world events are shaped by power relations among individuals. We are at their mercy. Similarly-situated counterparts in America are the people who sweat us at law to keep themselves in power, to send our children off to be killed in some atrocious war whose purpose is to enrich bankers and defense industrialists and politicians. These are the people who regulate our lives to the smallest detail, who in many cases decide whether a child far away will eat rice, or wheat, or nothing at all. It is amazing that we buy into it.

Gurcharan Das (Foreign Affairs, July/August 2006) says, “The Indian State no longer generates public goods. Instead, it creates private benefits for those who control it. Consequently, the Indian State has become so riddled with perverse incentives … that accountability is almost impossible.”

“One of the saddest lessons of history is this: if we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It is simply too painful to acknowledge — to ourselves — that we’ve been so credulous.”

~ Carl Sagan

It’s just as difficult to detect an official’s dishonesty as it is to discover how much water is drunk by the swimming fish.”

It is my perception that if you follow the money, you’ll find that the game is to generate war, finance both sides at interest (all war is debt financed), then finance reconstruction at interest. Using the model of the Treaty of Versailles after WWI, the seeds of the next war and the next financial cycle are carefully planted in the “peace plan” that is promulgated for public consumption after the war. It is an endless circle of cannibalization, using human beings as cannon fodder in wars whose purpose is massive transfers of wealth to the already-powerful.

“The tradition among financiers of profiting from both sides of armed conflict; the formula by which war is converted into debt and debt converted back into war.”

~ Griffin, The Creature From Jekyll Island, 1994

It seems to me that our so-called “lawmakers” are in fact a gang of thieves and murderers who meet in congress to fight over division of spoils and to perpetuate the system of “sweat them at law” in order to keep the public trough full. At this trough they feed on the social body like so many leeches. The only difference is that “lawmakers” have the power of selective mass murder of their intended victims.

“It is nonsensical to consider the institution of a State as a solution to the problem of possible conflict, because it is precisely the institution of a State which first makes conflict unavoidable and permanent.”

~ Hans Hermann-Hoppe, 16 March 2006

Since the advent of settled agriculture, men have fought over the means of production, beginning with land. Control of the minds of others was a tool of the ruler-priesthood alliance to facilitate control of production. We have now evolved to a “knowledge” economy. “Things” are represented by symbols, and knowledge workers manipulate symbols. The battle has become for control of information, perception and knowledge. The ultimate means of production being the mind, the battle is for control of the mind itself. The mind is the ultimate “property right” which must be defended against the powers of the Corporate State.

I believe our situation is much more dangerous than most — or even perhaps any of us — can understand. Powerful men are planning to manipulate consciousness itself. We face a direct confrontation with the “Dark Side” of human consciousness. Individuals who have enlisted with the dark side now have under their control weapons with power of annihilation, both quick and slow. Quick is represented by nuclear-biological-chemical. Slow is represented by control of the genetic material of the world’s food supply. Genetically modified “designer-human” cloned for particular purposes such as war is not far below the horizon of future. Mental conditioning via mass media is the anesthesia by which we are benumbed to the future being planned for us.

If we have not the will to revolution of consciousness itself, how can this end?

274332,"Recently by Doug Casey: Gun Control

L: Doug, I just saw that Obama is threatening the regime in Syria with military force if they use chemical weapons in their fight to retain power. Unlike most of the pundits filling the airwaves with comments, you’ve actually been there. What do you make of what’s going on?

Doug: I’ve been there twice, actually. On one of those, I was basically there over the Christmas holiday season. I rented a car in Damascus, drove around, and saw a lot of the country. I, of course, did the tourist things, like visiting the great mosque in Damascus and the Krak des Chevaliers — which is one of the best-preserved medieval castles anywhere — and the Roman city of Palmyra. But I also got down off my horse, as it were, and walked the souqs. I even checked out local beachfront real estate. They don’t have much, but there’s about 50 miles of beachfront, so I went to see if there were any bargains. I’ll buy almost anything, anywhere, if the price is low enough, especially cheap beach land. I didn’t see anything appealing — being the only foreigner on the whole strip didn’t seem likely to work out too well, and not much fun in a culture that frowns on alcohol and bikinis.

Overall, I have to say that the country seemed reasonably calm and busy — in the “business” sense — without a great presence of police. I understood there was a significant secret police presence — it was definitely not a place to voice political opinions — but I didn’t see signs of widespread public fear. The people did not seem particularly ground down with poverty or repression.

L: So, do you doubt the uprising now is a genuine rebellion by the oppressed masses — perhaps it’s just a power struggle between different factions, some claiming to speak for the oppressed?

Doug: Well, you really have to live somewhere to get to know the place, and I didn’t. I’m just saying that my impression of Syria, for all its evil reputation in the West — a veritable Mordor in the eyes of TV watchers — was not so bad. It was definitely less repressive than the USSR or Eastern Europe before 1990. Of course, the government was and is run by criminals — but that’s true almost everywhere. I don’t know who the good guys are in the current conflict or even that there are any.

L: So it looked fairly normal to you? But normal in that part of the world has hardly been a shining beacon of liberty and prosperity for all.

Doug: No, it hasn’t. Since the USSR collapsed, the Mid-East, Central Asia, and Africa have competed for having the most repressive regimes and backward economies. One interesting thing to me was that the country seemed to be in a time warp — it was like going to other places as they were 40 years ago. There was almost no new building going on — I remember the big fuss at the time was that the Kuwaitis were building a Four Seasons hotel. That was going to be by far the classiest joint in Damascus, when done. At the time I was there, the best place was a rather down-at-the-heels Sofitel.

Another thing that you never hear on the news is that the country has exchange controls. Reporters seem to consider that part of the natural landscape. They’re insulated from the effects of FX controls by their corporate expense accounts, and they don’t understand those effects. This is one reason most reporting is so pedestrian and vapid — but I digress. Repressive governments always have exchange controls, because they make it very inconvenient for the locals to pick up and leave; as we’ve discussed in the past, the US is moving in that direction. Locals have to exchange their basically worthless currency for that of some neighboring country; otherwise, they have no way to spend when they get there.

I can also say that there wasn’t an obvious military presence in Syria that I could see, but it makes sense that a huge portion of the GDP went to buying Soviet-era military hardware — tanks and jet fighters. In today’s world, that stuff amounts to junk. And that’s entirely apart from the fact that most Third-World armies are worthless for fighting real wars; their main purpose is to build a power base for the regime and suppress the people. Also, it’s well known — thanks to Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, among other sources — that Syria is one of the places the CIA used to ship… um… dissidents, for lack of a better word, to be tortured. These things are not usually signs of a happy, peaceful population.

And there are deep-rooted reasons for tension. Syria — like almost all of the countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia — is an artificial construct put together, completely arbitrarily, by politicians in the boardrooms of Europe. In the case of Syria, it was assembled from some of the remnants of the Ottoman Empire by the Europeans after World War I. As in neighboring Lebanon and Iraq, it’s got at least a dozen major religious/tribal/ethnic groups that are loyal mainly to themselves. The idea of a Syrian nation is a fantasy. It was inevitable that eventually Syria would fall apart — just as it was and is inevitable for most of the other artificially constructed countries to fall apart. This applies to the EU now as well, for similar reasons.

L: I didn’t know that — about the dozen different religions. I would have expected the lines on the map to be artificial, since the people in the area were historically nomadic, but I would have thought they shared more in common, culturally. I suppose it only seems that way because I’m on the outside and have not looked closely.

Doug: Yes. Just to begin with, there’s the Shia and Sunni Muslims, but there are many subdivisions within these and other schools of thought. There are also a number of different sects of Christians still there, and Jews as well. Some people worship Jesus, some worship Yahweh, some worship Allah. Nobody seems to agree on what these various gods really say or what they tell you to do or not do, but most everybody seems to take it pretty seriously — and in the Middle East, much more than almost anywhere else. Religious wars seem to be a specialty of the various children of Abraham; the Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, Zoroastrians, pagans, atheists, and what-have-you, are historically much, much more live and let live.

L: So, presuming that the majority of those who control the government in Syria are of one religious/ethnic/cultural group, as is often the case, do you think they’d have any qualms against using chemical weapons against the rebels? It could seem like “us vs. them” to them.

Doug: I wouldn’t doubt that at all — although chemical weapons are messy, and hugely overrated. But all this fuss and bother about Syria’s chemical weapons is distorted and misguided — just as was the case with the nonexistent weapons the Iraqis were said to have.

In the first place, if one believes that governments should exist at all and that the need for a military is one of the justifications for the state, then one can’t argue that such states should not have weapons. The details of the weapons are irrelevant once you grant the basic premise. And it certainly makes no sense to argue that some governments should have certain weapons, and some should not. The US has huge arsenals of chemical weapons, and no one is calling for military force to take them away. Why does the US have them? Who might they use them against?

L: Well, some governments are thought to be more responsible, or less evil, than others…

Doug: Doesn’t matter. The people running any given government, and their intentions, can change very quickly. You can’t accept the idea of sovereign nations and argue that some should be able to have weapons that others cannot. And if you did try to impose different weapons rights on good-guy countries and bad-guy countries, you’d have to have some sort of super-country to make it stick, and that would be very dangerous indeed. Who decides who is a good guy? The fact is that the Germans during World War II actually thought they were the good guys.

L: Many people think the UN should be in charge and make that determination.

Doug: Those people are deluding themselves and are woefully ignorant of history if they think bigger government is better government… and dangerously and pathetically nave if they think one super-state with the power to rule them all would be impervious to corruption. If the UN became the mightiest force on earth, then no one could stop them, and very bad things would happen. The UN having real power would be about the worst possible outcome. Thankfully, right now it’s nothing more than an incredibly corrupt and dysfunctional homeowners’ association for governments. If it got real power, it would become a much more serious magnet for sociopaths than it currently is.

L: One ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them.

Doug: Exactly. It’s the fact that the nations of the world are not united that has saved us from global mismanagement and despotism. It’s too bad that there are only about 200 sovereign states; ideally we would have seven billion.

L: Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely. The antidote is decentralizing power as much as possible.

Doug: Yes. Just look at what the US is already doing, because it sees itself as top dog. The US has increasingly been taking on the role of global “RoboCop,” using its military power to impose its notions of what should be on other countries and peoples around the world. The results are almost invariably destructive and counterproductive on the ground where US force is projected. Just look at the happy outcomes in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, for just three current, quick examples. Furthermore, it’s unethical to force US taxpayers to bankroll foreign interventions many of them — perhaps even most of them — do not approve of.

L: And it forces US troops who just want to defend their loved ones to go off and die in foreign lands for purposes that have nothing to do with why they signed up.

Doug: True enough — although the military has always attracted a certain type of young male who wants to visit exotic foreign lands, meet interesting people, and kill them. Even if it were true that Syria has chemical weapons, and even if it were true that the government forces in Syria plan to use them against their opposition — and in today’s world chemical weapons are mainly useful against civilian populations in cities — that does not create a moral obligation on the US to go off and try to stop it. It would be quite blackly comedic if the US decided to use its own huge stock of chemical weapons to prevent the Syrians from using theirs…

Whenever I think of the US military, I’m forced to think of Dr. Strangelove, actually.

L: So just leave those poor, innocent people in Syria to die?

Doug: Well, those poor people tolerated their local despotism for years — and many of them surely participated in it or collaborated with it in various ways over the years, so it’s arguable how innocent they all are. But no, that’s not the only option. Those who find the actions of the Syrian state reprehensible and want to do something about it should be free to do so. The US government used to allow this with letters of marque and reprisal. Now of course, it’s quite illegal for an American to even contemplate.

In my ideal world, people everywhere would be perfectly free to arm themselves and hop on a plane to wherever tyranny flared up, and help put an end to it.

Anyone who really believes that bad guys around the world should be stopped ought to stop trying to coerce others to take action via the state, and should volunteer themselves. If they are not willing to do that, it’s just hypocrisy and cowardice to force others — taxpayers and soldiers — to do their bidding for them. If you want to talk the talk, then you should be willing to walk the walk.

L: But we don’t live in your ideal world…

Doug: More’s the pity. In any event, what the US is trying to do is completely insane. The Russians are very friendly with the Syrians, and even have a naval base in Syria. Direct US action against the government of Syria could provoke the Iranians as well. Becoming declared enemies of the Assad regime could have many negative consequences beyond what may happen in Syria — and will certainly hasten the insolvency of the US government.

Besides, taking out the Assad regime may only make matters worse — who’s to say that whoever seizes power after Assad is gone will be any better? Perhaps the result will be a full-blown civil war that lasts for years, laying most of the country to waste in the process. Just look at what’s going on in Egypt and Libya — did the people there become suddenly better off? Libya, by the way, is another country that’s on the ragged edge of splitting up into several smaller countries or tribes, fighting over Libya’s resources.

Things like this are terrible, but they’ve been going on since the dawn of history — it’s arrogant and foolish in the extreme to imagine that outsiders can create lasting peace in places full of people who hate each other. There are dozens of places around the world that have imminent potential for genocide: Mali, Sudan, Congo, Nigeria, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and many others, not just Syria. At the end of the day, there’s no way outsiders can make any of these places better. Outside volunteers might participate in the process, but the people in these places need to sort things out themselves, find solutions that work for them. One can only hope they’re not typical political solutions.

L: So you’re not advocating turning a blind eye to the woes of the world, just keeping the state out of it and leaving it to individual conscience?

Doug: Yes. But the question now is: which will be the next of these Arab despotisms to fall apart? Maybe Algeria? It could just as easily be Morocco or Mauritania.

L: What about the big one: Saudi Arabia? The guys on top there don’t seem like the sort to inspire great love among the people.

Doug: Agreed. I don’t know when, but I’d say Saudi is a slam-dunk candidate for blowing up. Something like half the population is under 25, and unemployment is huge. All the money is sucked off by the royal family; it’s rather ridiculous that the country is named after the family that took it over after World War I. The place is a gigantic accident waiting to happen.

So of course, the US will stick its nose into that mess as well, at great cost. Saudi being the sacred homeland of The Prophet — “peace be upon him,” as they like to say — putting US troops there to keep the oil flowing would lead to all sorts of trouble. The long war between believers in Jesus and believers in Allah has been going on since the 7th century and shows signs of seriously heating up.

L: So, in this world full of nation-states, what should be done?

Doug: I hate to put myself in the place of Thomas Friedman, busybody to the world, but if you ask me, I’d say the US should withdraw its troops from all foreign bases, cut military spending on the order of 90%, abolish the CIA, and stop intervening in foreign countries. That would be a good start, anyway.

L: Some people would say that’s acknowledging defeat — admitting to the world that the US doesn’t have the power to boss everyone around — and that could invite attack.

Doug: I would argue to the contrary: cutting our losses now will slow the US descent into insolvency, which is the absolute worst thing for “national security” — although that’s a dangerous and grossly overrated concept. It might even give the US time to rebuild its economic and social strength, which is the real power that defeated the US’s opponents in WW II. Most important of all, instead of meddling and making enemies, the US could again become the shining example it should be, the beacon of hope to people all around the world that the Statue of Liberty is supposed to represent.

L: I note that it’s a statue of liberty, not a statue of some thug with a sword or club, like those that adorn gates and castles all around Europe. Right, not might, was the symbol of the America that Was.

But okay — investment implications? The trend towards more disintegration in North Africa and the Middle East can’t be good for oil production…

Doug: No, chaos isn’t good for oil production — but it’s bullish for energy prices. Fighting over control of oil fields is never good for output. But not only can we avoid being hurt by higher prices, we can profit mightily from them. I’ll leave it to your bro, Marin, to lay out the best ways to play investing in energy trends in the Casey Energy Report.

However, rising energy costs are not good for industry as a whole. That has implications for the whole global economy, which will have to absorb the higher costs.

On the most fundamental level, this trend — in Syria and the rest of that part of the world — is not good for either the global economy or world stock markets. That’s because stock markets gain — or should gain — over the long term, based on growth in capital, and war destroys capital.

L: I was taught in school that WW II ended the Great Depression.

Doug: Any economist who looks at the data knows that’s not true. But most of those who masquerade as economists today are really just political apologists, like Paul Krugman. War is an ill wind that blows no good. It is a purely destructive force that can only create a net loss for the world as a whole. I don’t see any good at all that could come from US meddling in Syria or other such countries. It’s not just asking for trouble — it’s begging for a catastrophe.

L: But it’s going to happen — so bet on higher energy prices… What else?

Doug: I may sound like a broken record, but I’d be remiss if I didn’t remind people to diversify against political instability in the world by internationalizing their assets and lives, and to buy gold. I suspect very, very few have done so, however.

L: That brings up a question we’ve had from readers: could gold have peaked already? If you look at a long-term chart, say, a ten-year chart for gold, you’ll see that the steady upward march has been broken. The top of the curve has definitely turned downwards, since last year. But you’re as bullish as ever?

Doug: Yes. For starters, unlike what happened back in 1980, when gold last peaked, interest rates are extremely low, kept there artificially by the Fed. Back in 1980, interest rates had risen to extremely high levels, which encouraged people to switch to saving in dollars. In the 1970s — the period that led to the last peak — governments were afraid of inflation and were working to reduce inflation of the currencies. Now, governments are racing to debase their currencies at truly phenomenal rates. Even as we speak gold is heading up again. I’d say the chances of gold having peaked for this cycle are slim to none.

L: And Slim’s out of town?

Doug: [Chuckles] Yes, exactly. But we’ll be discussing how to survive and profit in a politicized economy at our upcoming Carlsbad seminar. I invite our current readers to join us there, although the number of attendees is quite limited, as always. It’s going to be a worthwhile and enjoyable event.

L: All right then — thanks for another interesting conversation.

370930,"September 1, 1939 — exactly seventy years ago today — is customarily considered the day when World War II began, owing to the German invasion of Poland. Of course, some belligerents, most notably the Japanese and the Chinese, had already been at war for years, and others did not join the fray until later. The United States actually began to participate in the war almost immediately, but its participation remained for the most part covert until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.

I was born in the midst of this terrible event, and all my life, whenever anyone referred to the war, I have assumed, as most Americans have, that the reference was to World War II. It was the largest and the most horrible of all wars, although, sad to say, it no more proved to be the war to end war than its predecessor (1914—18) had been. In many ways the two world wars are best understood as two phases of a single conflict, although the matter is much more complicated than that formulation might suggest.

No one knows with much confidence how many people died as a result of the war. Estimates range widely, from a low of about 50 million to a high of nearly 80 million. Perhaps two-thirds of the dead were civilians. Countless others were wounded or harmed in various ways, as by malnutrition. Millions were spiritually scarred for life. The war was very productive of nightmares that, for some individuals, recurred for decades. After all that had taken place between 1939 and 1945, it was difficult to believe that the human beings of the mid-twentieth century, many of whom had regarded themselves as civilized, were any better than their savage ancestors of ten thousand years ago.

Yet, oddly enough, World War II has developed a reputation in this country as the Good War — an unfortunate turn of phrase, if ever there was one. The war is taken to have been good primarily because (1) the Allied side is believed to have represented the morally virtuous side, in opposition to the manifestly evil Axis side; (2) it got the U.S. economy out of the Great Depression; and (3) it left the world a better place, mainly because of Nazi Germany’s defeat.

For me, these ideas fall under the rubric of myth. I am not saying that no good came of the war, because obviously some did. As much as anyone, I believe that the destruction of the Nazi regime in Germany was a splendid thing for the human race. But every good end must be weighed against the means by which it was achieved, and in this perspective the war’s positive achievements take on a sickly pallor.

In this war, the belligerents plumbed new depths of depravity: operation of mass-destruction death camps, torture of every conceivable kind, terror bombing and other attacks systematically aimed at civilian populations, crowned by the gratuitous atomic bombing of two large, defenseless cities. I am aware that some people still defend some of these heinous actions, but in my mind nothing the war achieved can justify them. Indeed, I seriously doubt that anything can justify them. Yet such wanton, barbaric cruelties were deeply woven into the fabric of the war’s conduct from its earliest days. One is scarcely engaging in moral equivalence if one concludes that neither side represented the good guys. There was plenty of evil to go around.

I have been combatting for decades the widely believed notion that the war got the U.S. economy out of the Great Depression. For readers who still labor under this misconception, I recommend the first five chapters of a book called Depression, War, and Cold War.

22303,"Newspapers were recently flush with headlines declaring that Europeans did not approve of George Bush.

Good. Very good. Something would be wrong if they approved. Remember that Bill Clinton was quite popular in Europe. You get the idea.

Americans (at least those of “European” descent, as if anyone were not descended from specific nations of Europe, e.g., France) live independently of their ancestral European homes for good reason — their ancestors didn’t like the domestic policies of those European nations such as Italy, England, France and Germany that made life unbearable. So they left. From 1776 through 1783, the colonists of British North America made this point quite dramatically: by killing British soldiers who sought to “persuade” them otherwise.

And so we have the USA, a free and independent country (as things go), being told by the European socialists that the socialists do not like our way of doing things (click here for the International Herald Tribune “Bush poll”).

In the IHT poll linked above, notice that the Italians, English, French and Germans were in favor of American free trade policies, and of sending American troops to the Balkans.

Well, of course. Despite the communist-engineered, utterly phony, made for TV “protests” over globalization, the average Italian man on the street knows that America is a massive marketplace. Italian wines, pottery, machines (including shotguns — yes! beautifully, handcrafted shotguns, which retail for many thousands of dollars) and pasta sell very well in the United States. Where American troops are concerned, if you are a German, Italian, or Frenchman, whose sons would you rather see patrolling the Balkans: yours, or the children of some American family you’ve never met? Tough call.

Notice also that the European respondents disapproved of American refusal to join the Kyoto back-to-the-Stone Age treaty on emissions, and of “Bush’s support for the death penalty in the US.” At least the pollsters seem aware of the fact that Bush has no actual power over the death penalty, as it is a matter of state, and not federal, law. Where Kyoto is concerned, perhaps this is again a recognition of the practical effects of State policy: if the US does not submit to the silliness of the Kyoto treaty, America will (by default, not by any sound policy) reclaim its former manufacturing advantage, namely, less regulation than the rest of the world.

Talk about backing your way across the finish line, though.

What is motivating such polling, however, is the European Union’s drive for legitimation and survival. After Irish voters rejected the “deeper and broader” integration proposed by the Treaty of Nice (France). After having fought for their independence for a very long time, the Irish were rightly suspicious of the power-mad EU, which has gone so far as to outlaw the English system of measurements. You know: feet and inches, and all that. Although you might expect the Irish to cheer at this banishment of something English, the Irish are not fools.

And so politicians, through their pollster servants, now attempt to create a European identity by defining what it means to be European by negation: it means not being like that awful American president, George Bush.

No matter how much the average Frenchman or Italian might (or might not) dislike the policies of George Bush, there is no reason to sign on to the expansion of the collectivist European Union.

The siren song of the Eurocrats is “peace.” But it is a phony peace. The socialist policies of the European ruling class will not change, it will merely be the case in a European superstate that the socialists will not need to go to war with one another because they will all be on the same side. Where their fellow Europeans are concerned, then, they will merely engage in good, old fashioned filthy power politics and media assassination campaigns. Where the rest of the world is concerned, time will tell. Humanitarians with armies are dangerous things.

The core policies of the European Union are statist, regulatory, and not conducive to freedom. The European Union, like the socialist democracies it would supplant, will ultimately stifle productivity and wealth, no matter that it may appear to have created prosperity in the short run.

Americans should not be disturbed in the least to find that Europeans do not approve of everything done by George Bush. For that matter, many Americans do not approve of the policies of George Bush. Some news.

A couple of policy wonks, Michael O’Hanlon and Ken Pollack, spent a week in Iraq and came back. One said he thought it was less violent. They both said in an op-ed piece that the war was winnable.

It’s characters like these who make a man like Juan Cole so valuable. Cole is a scholar who, unlike the policy wonks, spent years in the Middle East and is fluent in Arabic. You can benefit from his experience and knowledge by visiting his blog, Informed Comment.

Cole, for example, points out that July was, in fact, the deadliest month for Americans since the war began. Seventy-four Americans were killed during July, and Iraqi deaths rose 23 percent over June, to 2,024. So if the American death rate is up and the Iraqi death rate is up, on what basis did the wonks see less violence during their July excursion to the land of Babylon?

As for the war being winnable, every one of our military big shots has said it can’t be won militarily. They all say it has to be a political solution. Well, the Iraqi government has failed to meet every one of the political benchmarks set by President Bush. No reconciliation, no oil law, no law on distributing oil revenues, no reversal of the anti-Baath policies. In fact, the largest Sunni bloc in the prime minister’s Cabinet just walked out, which makes reconciliation even more remote.

Add to that the following: Reconstruction is obscenely behind schedule, corruption is nearly universal, and 4 million Iraqis have been displaced from their homes. Two million of those are refugees. I would like to know what evidence there is that the war has suddenly become winnable.

I’m sure Secretary of State Condi Rice and Defense Secretary Bob Gates got an earful at their recent meeting with Arab leaders. What they didn’t get, despite offering a bribe of billions of dollars in weapons, was any pledge to do anything in Iraq. The Saudis said they might consider opening an embassy. What Gates and Rice probably heard was: We told you not to invade Iraq, you disregarded our advice and made a mess, so it’s yours to clean up. Don’t try to drag us into it.

Iraq is no longer a nation-state. We have shown the world that we know how to destroy a state, but when it comes to establishing one, we are incompetent dunces. It is to our everlasting shame that despite billions of dollars spent, Iraqis must still walk in open sewage and swelter in heat because electricity is only available a few hours a day. It’s a clear case of greed and corruption trumping — or, God forbid, replacing — American know-how. We should not forget that prior to our wars and sanctions, Iraq had one of the higher living standards in the Middle East.

I don’t know what we can do in the face of morally corrupt and incompetent officials — both theirs and ours. I suppose we shall have to sit back and watch the destruction proceed from one blunder to the next. Be glad you’re not an Iraqi. Be glad if you are not in the American military.

In the meantime, try to remember that it is August, and August is a lovely time in the United States. Cherish your children and your grandchildren, and when you hug them, thank God that they are not suffering like Iraqi and Palestinian children, not to mention millions of others.

I’ve always believed that the best incentive to re-energizing American political energy would be a true grasp of just how unbelievably fortunate we are. We need to appreciate that. We need also to understand that it is not permanent, that we could lose it all. We are not invincible.

Since, in our republican form of government, all official actions are done by elected officials, we have to be far more careful about the people we give our vote to. It really is true, as Forrest Gump’s mama told him, that stupid is as stupid does. So let us — myself included — stop stupidly voting for stupid or irresponsible public officials.

309912,"It can’t get any worse than this. Jerome Powell is a Wall Street-coddling Keynesian and Washington lifer who passes for a Janet Yellen replica – that is, save for his tie and trousers and his as yet underdeveloped capacity to whine pedantically.

During his years on the Fed since May 2012, Powell has voted approximately 44 times to drastically falsify interest rates and to recklessly and fraudulently monetize trillions of the public debt. That is, Powell has been all-in for a destructive central banking regime that is literally asphyxiating capitalist prosperity in America.

We will get to the latter in more detail momentarily, but just consider the plight of bank account savers during the 65 months “Jay” has served on the Federal Reserve Board. They have been continuously savaged by negative real interest rates averaging -1.8% per year. That cumulates to a 9% confiscation of inflation-adjusted principal during that five and one-half year period, but this purported Republican dissented not a single time.

Time to buy old US gold coins

And now he is being appointed Fed Chairman by a purported Republican President!

At this point, therefore, it can be well and truly said that Wall Street owns the nation’s central bank and that the Republican party has morphed into a gang of dutiful handmaidens. Any semblance of fidelity to sound money and free market capitalism – of the type, for instance, so brilliantly articulated by Treasury Secretary Bill Simon during Ford’s time and George Humphreys during the Eisenhower era – has been lost in the fog of history.

Yes, we know that the Donald came to the Oval Office with a giant disability on the matter of sound money.

To wit, he claims to be a billionaire and perhaps is. But if so, it wasn’t owing to the genius and business acumen domiciled in Trump Tower; it was solely and completely due to the fact that the Donald’s 40-year career as a leveraged real estate developer was flattered beyond measure by the cheap debt and serial bubbles that have been the essence of central bank policy since Volcker was fired in 1987.

So we did take his campaign attack on the Fed’s “big, fat, ugly bubble” with several grains of salt, and knew that his self-characterization as a “low interest man” did not bode well for his approach to filling the raft of vacancies at the Fed.

Still, the choice of Powell is a shocker. This guy is so deep in the tank for the speculative classes and such a mechanical Keynesian that there is really no hope at all that the era of Bubble Finance will end – that is, voluntarily and without a thundering financial crash.

Indeed, Powell is so mired in Fed group think with respect to the ridiculous fixation on 2.00% inflation and the utterly discredited Phillips Curve and DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) models that you might well think he was Charlie McCarthy to Janet Yellen’s Edgar Bergen.

Thus, in almost identical words to Yellen’s blathering at her last presser, Powell has been mystified by an alleged inflation shortfall and gums at will about too much slack in his bathtub model of the US economy:

“Inflation is a little bit below target, and it’s kind of a mystery,” he told CNBC in August. “You would have expected, given that we’re getting tighter labor markets, that we’d have a little higher inflation. I think that what that gives us is the ability to be patient.” The relationship between slack and inflation has weakened substantially over the years,” Powell said in June 2016. “In addition, inflation depends importantly on the inflation expectations of workers and firms. A widely shared view among economists today is that, unlike during the 1970s, expectations are no longer heavily influenced by fluctuations in inflation, but are fairly constant, or anchored. For both these reasons, inflation has become less responsive to cyclical changes in the economy.” “While inflation expectations seem to me to remain reasonably well anchored, it is essential that they remain so,” he said. “The only way to assure that anchoring is to achieve actual inflation of 2 percent, and I am strongly committed to that objective.”

Folks, that’s just the group think voodoo economics that has metastasized in the Eccles Building for the last several decades. Indeed, the latter now sits at ground zero in the Swamp, and the Donald didn’t even bother to look beyond its walls to fill a job that in many ways is more crucial and powerful than his own.

As the Donald would tweet it, SHAME!

Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that Powell was the #1, #2, and 3# pick of the Vampire Squid after its own nominee, Gary Cohn, stepped in some deep dodoo during the Charlottesville contretemps. The tip-off is Powell’s above reiteration of the 2% inflation goal.

The latter has absolutely nothing to do with genuine economic growth and main street prosperity. It is merely a ritual incantation used to justify the Fed’s plenary intrusion in the financial markets and relentless manipulation of the most important prices in all of capitalism: That is, the price of money, debt, the shape of the yield curve and the valuation of equities and other risk assets.

As we said on Fox Business last night (video below), after 100 months of so-called business expansion – the third longest on record – the idea that the money market rate should still be 1.13% is preposterous because in real terms in still negative. It is a massive open invitation to Wall Street speculators to buy any financial asset with a yield or prospect of short-term appreciation and fund them with free overnight carry administered, enforced and guaranteed by the central bank.

Indeed, Powell is so clueless on this matter that he actually describes the Fed’s fundamental policy tool as an exercise in administering prices in the money and debt markets, thereby implying that the 12 members of the FOMC know better than the millions of traders, investors and arbitrageurs who inhabit the casino, and that through the frail instrument of interest rate pegging can command the performance of a $$19 trillion economy.

Moreover, rather than arguing for pegging as a one-time, extraordinary response to a putative 500-year flood type of financial crisis, Powell argues that it constitutes a permanent regime of control. That is, capitalism is allegedly so fragile, unstable and disaster prone that it requires permanent guard rails and balancing wheels supplied by the FOMC in it purported infinite wisdom:

Powell seems to be in agreement stating in June of this year that “To affect financial conditions, the Federal Reserve has therefore used administered rates, including the interest rate paid on excess reserves (IOER) and, more recently, the offering rate of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility. This approach, sometimes referred to as a “floor system,” is simple to operate and has provided good control over the federal funds rate. In November 2016, when the Committee discussed using a floor system as part of its longer-run framework, I was among those who saw such an approach as “likely to be relatively simple and efficient to administer, relatively straightforward to communicate, and effective in enabling interest rate control across a wide range of circumstances.”

The Great Deformation:... David Stockman Best Price: $$3.11 Buy New $$11.26 (as of 09:00 EST - Details )

The above hogwash is stunning proof that Greenspan-Bernanke-Yellen-Powell style monetary central planning is a clear and present danger to capitalist prosperity. It amounts to a clueless confession of willful incompetence, and evidence that Powell and the rest of the FOMC – are so mesmerized by Keynesian academic models that they can’t see the real world starring them in the face.

What’s right in front of their collective noses, of course, is a domestic and global financial system that is everywhere booby-trapped with massive and incendiary financial bubbles, unsustainable leverage in both overt and covert forms (i.e. options), and relentless, liquidity-fueled speculation that infects the very warp and woof of most financial markets.

Even the core blue-chip 10-year UST market is a speculators’ haven where on the margin pricing is driven by complex, leveraged arbitrages, not the bid of trust department managers in behalf of widows and orphans.

Indeed, the evidence of an impending financial blow-up is palpable and plenary.

There is no other way to describe European junk bond yields at 2% and therefore below the U.S. Treasury; or the Russell 2000 trading at 95X earnings in an economic backdrop where most activity measures – from auto sales ex-hurricane replacement, to housing, restaurant sales, manufacturing production, business investment, exports, construction spending – are clearly rolling over.

Likewise, there is the insanity in the momo precincts of the stock market where the likes of Amazon and Netflix trade at 280X and 200X net income, respectively; or where the giant fake auto company, Tesla, trades at an infinite PE multiple after 10 years of cumulative losses totaling $$4.5 billion and which, at a market cap of $$50 billion, is valued the same as Ford and nearly equal to GM. Between them, the latter sold 10 million cars last year – 125 times more than Tesla – and booked $$7.5 billion of profits or well more than the latter’s total loss-making sales.

You only need read the latest Fed minutes – which Powell fully subscribed to – in order to realize that the Fed’s scribe hit the “delete” key when the discussion turned to financial bubbles. Then again, perhaps the myopic lenses of their Keynesian beer goggles filtered out entirely the above evidence of today’s raging mania in risk asset markets, thereby ensuring that our monetary central planners will be taken by “surprise” for the third time this century.

The screaming disconnect implicit in Fed policy is evident when you compare Powell’s group-think complacency with the FOMC’s fastidious preoccupation with its preferred short-term inflation measures. That is, both the CPI and the PCE deflator have been in the 1.4% to 2.2% corridor for several months now, but the FOMC remains preoccupied with “low readings”.

Yet there is not a shred of evidence that 50 basis points of difference in a generic market basket of prices (which no one actually buys) makes any difference whatsoever to economic function in the main street economy. Well, except for pensioners, savers and most workers, whose purchasing power will fall further behind the closer the Fed gets to its magic 2.00% inflation reading.

We choose to express the Fed’s inflation goal to the second decimal point to highlight the lunacy of the entire inflation targeting regime. In fact, there is a breathtaking mismatch between the Fed’s inability to see a $$200-300 billion bubble of bottled air at Amazon, which enables it to ignore profits and investment returns in order to pursue a scorched earth policy of predation and destruction across the American retail landscape, and the fact that Fed heads like Powell spend countless hours down on their hands and knees with magnifying glass parsing utterly trivial differences in the PCE deflator readings.

Some members stressed the importance of underscoring the Committee’s commitment to its (2%) inflation objective. These members emphasized that, in considering the timing of further adjustments in the federal funds rate, they would be evaluating incoming information to assess the likelihood that recent low readings on inflation were transitory and that inflation was again on a trajectory consistent with achieving the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.

In short, this is a case of missing the forest for the trees like no other, and exposes the screaming contradiction at the heart of our rotten regime of monetary central planning.

Today’s Keynesian central bankers – and Powell is surely one straight from central casting – are always aiming to enhance, uplift and stimulate the main street economy but to do so they must detour through the canyons of Wall Street because that’s where their instruments of control reside.

As we indicated above, the Fed seeks to transmit its stimulus policies through the money markets by pegging overnight funding rates including Fed funds and through the fixed income and other securities markets, where its open markets desk drives the level and shape of the fixed income yield curve through bond purchases with fiat credits.

In this context, it is important to note that Janet Yellen, Jerome Powell and their ilk are playing a totally different game than their Keynesian grandfathers such as professors James Tobin, Walter Heller and Paul Samuelson. The latter were primarily fiscalists, which meant that if they wanted more housing production, for example, they would turn to builder subsidies or tax credits.

Likewise, if they felt the main street economy would have more zip with higher consumer spending, they would peddle tax rebates or increased entitlement benefits. And the same approach prevailed if more business investment was deemed to be helpful – as in Walter Heller’s (Kennedy’s chief economist) invention of the investment tax credit in 1962.

In a word, these grandfatherly Keynesians could do considerable long-run damage to capitalist prosperity and growth by causing resources to be channeled to sectors of the economy and purposes that deviated from market outcomes, and would thereby inevitably result in inefficiency, malinvestments and waste.

But the saving grace was transparency, targetability and limited collateral effects. Back in the 1970s, for example, the homebuilders and S&L industry were always looking to help the national economic good by offering first time buyer credits for new homes or rent subsidies to induce apartment construction. But you could measure the budget expense, debate the social cost/benefit equation and be reasonably sure that the subventions involved did not go into speculative schemes on Wall Street.

Yet here is exactly where Alan Greenspan and his successors and assigns – of whom Powell is the latest – committed the economic sin of the century. Greenspan was actually an anti-Keynesian in the old fashioned fiscalist sense and was a frequent comrade-in-arms with your editor in the budget battles of the early 1980s. Indeed, he helped us defeat every single Keynesian fiscal stimulus scheme that was floated on the Washington Swamp waters during the 1982-83 recession.

But apparently no good deed goes unpunished – especially when like Alan Greenspan you are always being too clever by half. That is, when he got to the Fed and soon had his hands all over the control dials on its printing presses, he had the epiphany that fiscal Keynesianism could be defeated permanently by seconding the job to the Fed.

Thus, if you wanted more housing starts, twist the interest rate dial to cheaper mortgages; or if you want more business investment, ginger the corporate stock and bond markets; or if you want more consumer spending, drive mortgage rates lower and housing prices higher so that households could supplement their earned incomes with MEW (mortgage equity withdrawal).

But as we said, this was way too clever by half. That’s because Greenspan’s backdoor Keynesianism unleashed the PhDs, bankers and policy apparatchiks that get appointed to the Fed to descend into the canyons of Wall Street en masse and continuously. So doing, it gave them license to fiddle and falsify all the financial asset prices that percolated through what had otherwise been the price discovery process of the free market.

From our vantage point 30-years later it is evident that this was a colossal mistake – the equivalent of inviting the Huns into Rome. And now, Jerome Powell is apparently the latest monetary Attila.

The fact is, the financial markets are the very heart of capitalism and constitute the delicate mainspring from which all else flows. Money, debt and other forms of capital most be priced efficiently, accurately and by the unfettered operation of the auction process for balancing supply and demand. That’s the only way you get allocative efficiency, financial discipline and rewards for true economic innovation, invention and entrepreneurial creativity all at the same time.

Accordingly, policy-making agents of the state should never, ever be allowed into the free market of finance. In fact, a policy regime that is explicitly posited on altering and falsifying financial asset prices is the mortal enemy of vibrant capitalism and true gains in living standards and wealth.

As we approach the third bubble crash of this century, the reason should be finally evident. Namely, financial repression massively incentivizes speculation, leveraged arbitrage, rent-seeking churning in the secondary markets and the diversion of real capital from the corporate sector and main street economy into financial engineering schemes which fuel even more speculation on Wall Street.

Thus, notwithstanding a tripling of business debt outstanding since the turn of the century, real net investment in productive business investment is 35% lower than it was in the year 2000.

Instead, the price falsification policies of the Fed have turned Wall Street into a gambling casino and the C-suites of Corporate America into financial engineering outfits. Accordingly, upwards of $$15 trillion has been cycled back into Wall Street during the last decade in the form of stock buybacks, unearned dividends, M&A deals and LBOs and recaps that fueled stock market inflation, not real investment, growth and jobs.

There is a saying that if your only tool is a hammer everything looks like a nail. So with still another clueless Keynesian taking the helm at the Fed – and in complete denial about the monumental bubbles and financial stability risks all around – it can also be well and truly said that if your only policy tool is to falsify financial assets prices you will repeatedly end up inflating bubbles until they eventually crash – and never see them coming, to boot.

So if the state must give capitalism the “help” it doesn’t need – then at least bring back our Keynesian grandfathers to the fiscal arena. With $$31 trillion of public debt already built in through 2027, they will get nowhere as the GOP tax-cutters are about to prove.

At least the fiscalists did not practice “trickle-up” economics by inflating bubbles that pleasure the 1%, but do nothing for the main street economy.

That’s the real irony. Modern central banking has not brought they ballyhooed Great Moderation, but a perverse cycle of periodic bubble collapses, which, in turn, induce corporate C-suites to attempt to protect their stock prices and options by throwing workers, assets and business infrastructure overboard in a desperate effort to appease the trading machines and gamblers on Wall Street.

So forget the Fed’s inflation targeting and its bathtub economics gibberish. Yellen, Powell and the rest of the Eccles Building posse are hopelessly Bubble Blind because inflating bubbles is the essence of what they do.

Then again, it is likely that Powell will be the last of the bubble blowers. Like Yellen he is so blind to the incendiary devices implanted throughout the financial system that he will likely continue her campaign to reload the Fed’s dry powder in order to combat the next recession somewhere down the road.

To that end, Powell has indicated he will pursue monetary policy normalization and balance sheet shrinkage until the Fed’s footings are rolled back to the $$2.5 trillion neighborhood.

That means a year from now the Fed will be selling bonds at a $$600 billion annual rate per its announced schedule and that will come atop a new borrowing requirement at the Treasury in the $$1 trillion + annualized range. And since the law of supply and demand has not been repealed – that bond selling tsunami will surely cause a traumatic rise of bond yields across the entire spectrum.

In a word, “Janet Yellen Powell” has drawn the short straw. On his watch, the whole misbegotten enterprise of 30 years will blow sky high.

To that extent, the Great Disrupter once again today lived up to his historic mandate. But not in what the boys and girls and robo-machines on Wall Street would perceive as a “good way”.

To the contrary, they will learn the hard way about the end of Bubble Finance in the very near future.

460237,"Recently by Patrick J. Buchanan: Did ‘The Great Society’ RuinSociety?

“I wish to express my deep regret for the reported incident. … I extend to you and the Afghan people my sincere apologies.”

As President Obama sent this letter of apology to Hamid Karzai for the burning by U.S. troops of Qurans that were used to smuggle notes between Afghan prisoners, two U.S. soldiers were murdered in reprisal.

Saturday, a U.S. colonel and a major working in the Interior Ministry were shot dead by an Afghan protesting the desecration of the Islamic holy book. All U.S. officers have been pulled out of the ministries in Kabul.

Sunday, seven U.S. troops on base were wounded by a grenade.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Gen. John Allen, commander in Afghanistan, have also offered their apologies.

Remarkable. After fighting for 10 years, investing $$500 billion, and losing nearly 2,000 dead and many more wounded and maimed to save Afghanistan from a Taliban future, America is issuing apologies to the regime and people we are fighting and dying to defend?

And how has Obama’s apology been received?

Abdul Sattar Khawasi, a member of Parliament, stood with 20 other members to declare, “Americans are invaders, and jihad against Americans is an obligation.” He urged mullahs to “urge the people … to wage war against Americans.”

In what other war would we have tolerated this from an elected leader of a government we had sent an army of 100,000 to protect?

Undeniably, the soldiers who burned the Qurans blundered. Yet there is no evidence that it was malicious. If vandals desecrate a Bible in America, burning and replacing the holy book would not be regarded a valid excuse for mayhem and murder.

If Afghans cannot understand this mistake and have no other way to express their rage than rioting and ranting, “Death to America!” what kind of raw material are we working with in building a Western-style democracy in any foreseeable century?

Two pertinent questions needs to be put.

While keeping Afghanistan free of the Taliban is a desirable goal, what vital U.S. interest would be imperiled should the Taliban take over again, now that al-Qaida is largely gone?

What price in blood and billions should we expend on what appears a dubious enterprise at best — creating a pro-American democracy in a country that seems mired in some distant century?

It is time we took inventory of all of these wars we have fought since the Army of Desert Storm restored the emir of Kuwait to his throne.

That 1991 war was seen as a triumph of American arms and a model of the global cooperation to come in establishing the New World Order of George H.W. Bush.

But the savage sanctions we imposed on a defeated Iraq and the planting of U.S. bases on Saudi soil that is home to Mecca was a casus belli for Osama bin Laden. Ten years after the triumph of Bush I, he brought down the twin towers.

This atrocity caused us to plunge into Afghanistan to dump over the Taliban and eradicate or expel al-Qaida. We succeeded, then decided to stay on and build a nation. After 10 years, what have we accomplished to justify the immense price we have paid?

In 2003, George W. Bush, seeking to complete the work begun by his father, invaded Iraq. But Saddam had no role in 9/11 and was no threat to America. Iraq did not even have weapons of mass destruction.

Today, after eight years of war, 4,500 dead, 35,000 wounded and a trillion dollars sunk, the 15,000 Americans we left behind are largely holed up in the Green Zone, as Iraq descends into sectarian, civil and ethnic war.

What did it all profit us?

How goes Libya after the U.S.-NATO intervention to dethrone Moammar Gadhafi?

Here is the Rand Corp.’s Frederic Wehrey:

“A weak transitional government confronts armed militias. … Defiant young men with heavy weapons control Libya’s airports, harbors and oil installations. Tribes and smugglers rule desert areas south of the capital. Clashes among various militias for turf and political power rage. …

“Libya teeters dangerously on the brink.”

Now we see a push for intervention in Syria from Sens. John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman. That would make us allies of al-Qaida, the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, all of which also seek the fall of Bashar al-Assad and the rise of a Sunni regime in Damascus.

But it is the clamor for a U.S. war on Iran that grows loudest.

375511,"Peppermint essential oil is so useful that is it comes as no surprise that even folks that are not well versed in the use of essential oils will have a bottle in their first aid kit. In my own case, peppermint oil was added to my collection in the 80s when I started suffering debilitating migraine headaches. Thankfully, the headaches are gone but peppermint essential oil remains a core component in my medicine cabinet.

There are many ways to use peppermint essential oil: topically either neat or mixed with a carrier oil, internally as a tea or as an addition to water, or aromatically in a diffuser or in a steaming bowl of water. Peppermint oil may also be ingested provided it is what is called “therapeutic grade”. You will know this by the supplement information on the label.

WHAT IS PEPPERMINT?

First and foremost, peppermint is a prolific garden plant that is so profuse that in my area. it must be confined to pots or planters lest it take over the entire garden. Trust me on this; left unchecked it is like a weed.

own version of the Mojito is up for grabs but chances are they did!

Peppermint and peppermint essential oil have many health-promoting properties. Peppermint is a great digestive, helps the respiratory system, promotes good circulation, and is an excellent anti-inflammatory and antiseptic. It also smells good and makes a superb air and breath freshener.

According to the National Institutes of Health, peppermint oil reduces spasms in the digestive tract. When applied to the skin, it creates surface warmth, which in turn relieves pain beneath the skin.

20 PRACTICAL USES OF PEPPERMINT ESSENTIAL OIL

Of the hundreds of potential uses for peppermint oil, I present 20 that are the most practical and most useful in a survival situation.

2. Eliminate Bad Breath/Halitosis: Bad breath is typically a symptom of some underlying factor. If the issue is digestive, 4 drops of peppermint oil diluted with water and swished in the mouth like mouthwash will bring relief. Better yet, add a few drops to some brandy and swish.

3. Relieve Heartburn: Add a drop or peppermint oil to your tea along with a teaspoon of honey. Or, try a drop of two of peppermint oil in a glass of milk. You can also mix 5 drops with a teaspoon of carrier oil (coconut oil, olive oil, etc.) and massage onto your upper abdomen.

4. Cool a Fever: A few drops of peppermint mixed with a carrier oil and applied to the torso can reduce body temperature by 3 degrees in minutes. You can also place a few drops of oil on a wet washcloth and apply head to toe to comfort and cool a fevered body.

5. Prevent Drowsiness: Combine peppermint with a citrus oil such as lemon or orange and apply to the back of the neck. Inhale the oil that is left on your hands. I love this; it really does work.

6. Soothe a Stomach Ache: Put one drop in a large glass water and drink up.

7. Reduce Bloating: Rub on the stomach to help with bloating caused by gas and indigestion.

8. Combat Nausea: Rub a drop of peppermint oil on the abdomen or place a drop in a cup of hot water and sip it.

9. Stop Itching: Apply peppermint oil to stop itching caused by bug bites, hives, poison ivy or poison oak.

10. Relieve constipation: Combined with a carrier oil and massaged over the lower abdomen, peppermint will relieve the constipation and get things moving again.

11. Deter Mice: Place cotton balls with peppermint in areas around your home where mice like to congregate. Mice do not like peppermint (and by the way, neither do raccoons).

water in a spray bottle. This also works to get rid of aphids in the garden.

13. Tick removal: Soak some peppermint oil on a q-tip then dab on the tick. Look for the tick to withdraw its head and then remove it.

14. Tendonitis and joint pain: I have shared this one with you before. Mix 10 drops each of peppermint, lavender and rosemary oil with 2 tablespoons of carrier oil. Massage away your aches and pains. This is also the basis for Miracle Healing Salve. It simply works!

15. Relieve seasonal allergies: Combine lavender, peppermint and lemon essential oils together with some carrier oil and rub on the bottoms of the feet, the back of the neck and across the forehead. Then take your hands, cup them over your nose and inhale with deep cleansing breaths. This will bring instant relief.

relieve sore, swollen and overworked feet.

17. Stress relief: Add to a diffuser to provide relief from stress, depression and mental exhaustion. There is something uplifting about peppermint and will leave you refreshed. This is also effective when your are feeling anxious and restless.

18. Freshen air: Ditto. Add to a diffuser to freshen the air.

19. Household cleaning: Mix with vinegar and water to make an effective, all purpose household cleaner that I call “Peppermint Juice”. Here is the recipe from Prepper Checklist: DIY Cleaning Supplies:

1/2 cup white vinegar32 oz. (1 quart) cups water1/4 tsp. to 1/2 tsp. peppermint essential oil

20. Control odor: A few drops in the bottom of your kitchen or bathroom garbage can will leave a nice, fresh, minty smell and will also deter those ants, spiders and mice.

216494,"I wish more Americans had an opportunity to get to know Muslims. Then they would not be susceptible to the silly anti-Muslim propaganda that is floated by some right-wing Christians.

Muslims are good folks. One fellow e-mailed me quite convinced that Muslims lop off the heads of every infidel they meet. I’ve been a guest in the homes of many Muslim friends, and the only thing they lopped off were extra servings of lamb.

People believe such nonsense because they are ignorant of the facts. The oldest Christian communities in the world are in Muslim countries. Some of the oldest Jewish communities in the world are in Muslim countries. The deputy foreign minister of Iraq is a Christian. Saddam Hussein donated $$1 million to help build a Christian church in the United States. There are Christians in practically all Muslim countries, and there have been for centuries. I’ve said all this before, but when lies blow strong, truth bears repeating.

Islam, like other religions, has different groups. Some are strict in their observances, and they might be likened to the Christian Pilgrims who settled Massachusetts. But even the most strict — commonly called fundamentalists these days — know that a Muslim is commanded to treat Jews and Christians ""as I would treat myself,"" in the words of a Hamas leader.

In my travels in Muslim countries, sometimes among the poorest of the poor, I was never panhandled or attacked. As far as crime goes, you’ll find cities like Beirut or Damascus or Amman or Ramallah much safer than most American cities.

Islam is not a religion with a hierarchy such as the Roman Catholic Church. In that respect, Muslims are much like Southern Baptists, only more so. Any group of Muslims can build a mosque and hire themselves an imam, or teacher. They are independent. There is no Muslim pope or College of Cardinals. There are no bishops. When an imam somewhere issues a fatwa, which is a sort of formal opinion on a subject, it is not binding. Like Protestant Christians, Muslims interpret their holy writings themselves and consider themselves answerable directly to God — or, to use the Arabic word, Allah.

Most of the disputes in the Middle East are secular and political. Hamas’ quarrel with Israelis is not about the fact that they are Jews but about the fact that they occupy Palestine. The objections some Muslims have to Western culture are the same as those some Christians have. They don’t like the violence, the immorality, the pornography and the greed. The conflict one sees between the religious and the secular in some Muslim countries is similar to the conflict in this country between religious and secular folks.

There are 6 million or 7 million American citizens who are Muslims. Muslims have been in this country since the late 19th century. If you don’t already, you should make an effort to get to know Muslims. You’ll find that they don’t fit the stereotypes created by mean-spirited propaganda or superficial news coverage.

Racism is a monstrous injustice because it imposes a stereotype on millions of innocent individuals. The only real solution is education and broad experience. It seems to me that God creates individuals one at a time, and it is the human mind that insists on grouping and classifying them. We should resist that temptation.

219241,"It is possible to become so inured to being told what to do, and how to do it, and who to do it with — to become so accustomed to being told what we can say, what we may publicly believe, what we must seem to think, how we must manage our affairs — that we cease to notice just how regimented we are. We are there. We now accept that very nearly everything whatsoever is the proper domain of government. Why?

For example, if I want to let people bring their dogs into my restaurant, why is it the business of government? It used to be, and may still be, that in rural England people regularly brought the pooch into the local pub. It was nice. Country people know dogs and like them. Why is it the government’s concern?

Frightened minor people will nervously wring damp fingers and say, but oh my goodness, it’s an issue of public health. In the first place, it isn’t. Generations grew up with dogs in the house, with whom children regularly played and occasionally slept. The recorded death rate has thus far been subliminal. Give me a quick list of five kids you remember who died of dog poisoning. In the second place, whose business is it? If I want to risk my life by sharing a bar with a golden retriever, why is it not my risk to take?

If you don’t want to come to my restaurant because a Border collie upsets you, then…don’t come. How hard is that? Find another restaurant. There are lots. If there aren’t, carry a box lunch. It’s my restaurant, not yours. If nobody comes to my place because of dog-distress, then I will go out of business. That’s my problem. It is not the government’s concern.

Incidentally, I much prefer dogs to drab officious little warts in governmental offices. I have lived with dogs, and found them preferable to bureaucrats on grounds of civility, intelligence, and unintrusiveness. Further, some of them could be trained to make change.

What about smoking? Why is it the government’s business? If I want to let people smoke in my bar, it’s my affair. People who don’t like it can, once again, go somewhere else. I don’t say this truculently. Customers have every right not to patronize establishments that they find disagreeable. If they don’t like the smoke, or the music, or the food, or my ugly mug, that thing in front with the hinges on it is available. A ""door,"" we call it.

I don’t go to places I don’t like, and don’t expect anyone else to. Why is any of this of concern to the government? To any government? Why must we be eternally diapered by tiresome prisses in power?

For that matter, why does the government have any business telling motorcyclists to wear helmets? The usual, and stupid, answer is that if I fall off and gork myself, the public will have to pay to maintain me on life-support forever. No. In the first place, that’s what insurance is for; in the second, the same argument supports making drivers of cars wear helmets, pay for full roll-cages, wear Nomex suits, and drive at five miles an hour.

In fact I don’t smoke, and I did wear a helmet, and it saved my life in a wreck. My choice, my consequence. Your helmet is not my business. Or vice versa.

Why is the government involved in the schools? If the public schools worked, an argument could be made for them: If children don’t learn to read, they are more likely to end up on the public nipple, which is everybody’s business. In fact, if the schools worked, you wouldn’t have to make an argument for them. In the fifties and early sixties, they did work. They taught the educable to read, did a reasonable job of preparing the bright for college, and did very little else. Which was exactly right.

Today they don’t work — endlessly, badly, overwhelmingly, highly documentably don’t work. They don’t work because they are chiefly a means of imposing social agendas for powerful lobbies and of hiding the failures of the swing vote in presidential elections.

Note that government is the cause of the failure. It is government in one form or another that mandates the hiring of low-grade (read certified) teachers, insists on hiring according to color instead of competence, forbids the firing of the demonstrably useless, and mandates the purchase of terrible texts. Government requires teaching to the level of the dullest-witted. Government also prevents the establishment of good schools in competition with itself. Don’t think so? Try to start a school and run it as you wish.

For this we pay taxes?

For that matter, why does the government interfere in the drug trade? When I was on the police beat in Washington a buddy of mine in the DEA estimated that ninety-five percent of drugs shipped to the United States successfully entered the country. That is, the government intercepts drugs roughly as well as it schools children. The difference is that we know how to teach kids, but just don’t do it. Nobody knows how to stop the influx of drugs.

In the Twenties the government tried to stop the sale of hooch. It didn’t work because the public wanted hooch. The same is true of drugs. People want them. That’s why they buy them. (A patented Fred Insight, forty-weight. You could lube bearings with it.) Further, anybody who wants drugs can get them. So why do we spend vast sums and put up with intrusion by a government that pretends to try to do what everyone in the business knows it can’t?

I do not say these things from some evangelical libertarian hostility to all things governmental. When government does something well, I say let it. You want to put little crawly prongy things on Mars to look for water and weird worms or half-eaten sandwiches discarded by space aliens? (I do, actually.) NASA does it well. The gadgets are there. They crawl. They’re prongy. You want to bring back the public schools of 1950? Good. They worked. I’ll vote for you.

Today, what the government ought to do, it does badly, and what it ought not do at all, it does too well — such as snoop, control, meddle, and impose the ways of the unwashed on everyone. And it’s going to get worse. Much worse.

223684,"Recently by Justin Raimondo: The Lobby Takes the Offensive

The rapturous reception afforded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as he ascended the dais to address a joint session of Congress was like the triumphs Roman generals were honored with as they returned from their wars of conquest. It's true u201CBibiu201D didn't have President Obama trailing behind him in chains, as the Romans dragged Vercingetorix, the king of the Gauls, but then again, that wasn't really necessary. Only hours before, Sen. Harry Reid had denied his own president and the leader of his party, distancing himself from the Obama administration's Mideast peace plan, and reiterating his support for Netanyahu, while other Democrats ran for the hills. Netanyahu's triumph — after 56 standing ovations — was complete.

The content of the Prime Minister's speech was almost irrelevant: it was the usual panoply of lies, u201Cspin,u201D and vaunting. Lies about how great the Palestinian economy is doing, spinning (i.e. glossing over) Israel's criminal occupation of conquered territories, and vaunting of Zionist power — not the Jewish state's military power, but its political power right here in this country. When it comes down to a contest between the chief executive of the most powerful nation in the world, and the Prime Minister of a country that would fall into the abyss without US support, the latter proved his superior potency.

u201CIn an unstable Middle East, Israel is the one anchor of stability. In a region of shifting alliances, Israel is America's unwavering ally. Israel has always been pro-American. Israel will always be pro-American.u201D

Only in a Bizarro World alternate universe is Israel u201Cthe one anchor of stabilityu201D in a volatile region. Quite the opposite is true: the Jewish state is the primary source of regional instability, due entirely to its ruthlessness and inhumanity in enforcing a military occupation that weighs heavily on the conscience of the world.

Netanyahu has it backwards: America is and has been Israel's unwavering ally, and yet, as Vice President Joe Biden found out on his last trip to Israel, this doesn't preclude the Israelis' open hostility. Ambushed and humiliated by his most ungracious hosts — who announced a new round of settlement-building the day the Vice President arrived — Biden learned first hand that this arrangement doesn't work both ways.

u201CMy friends, you don't need to do nation building in Israel. We're already built. You don't need to export democracy to Israel. We've already got it. You don't need to send American troops to defend Israel. We defend ourselves. You've been very generous in giving us tools to do the job of defending Israel on our own. Thank you all, and thank you President Obama, for your steadfast commitment to Israel's security. I know economic times are tough. I deeply appreciate this.u201D

How many lies can one speechwriter pack into a single paragraph? We are engaged in u201Cnation buildingu201D in Israel — how else are the Israelis spending that cool $$3 billion a year in u201Caidu201D? u201CWe're already builtu201D — so does that mean we can cut the Israelis off the dole, and stop borrowing from the Chinese in order to placate Tel Aviv? Surely that isn't what Netanyahu meant to say.

As for the boast that we needn't export democracy to Israel — because u201CWe've already got itu201D — what can one say to the ruler of a country that has established a two-tiered tyranny, granting the members of one religious group voting rights and the ability to move freely, and relegating the rest to a political limbo, and the status of helots imprisoned in their own land?

What can one say, except: You lie?

Netanyahu, whose first response to the upsurge in Egypt was to support Mubarak and cavil at the specter of a Muslim Brotherhood takeover in Cairo, had the nerve to hail the u201Cepic battle now unfolding in the Middle East,u201D which, he averred, is u201Cbetween tyranny and freedom.u201D Yet, in this battle, Israel is on the other side — the side of the tyrants — and always has been. u201CMillions of young people are determined to change their future,u201D he pontificated, to ringing applause. u201CWe all look at them. They muster courage. They risk their lives. They demand dignity. They desire liberty.u201D

That these very young people are risking their lives, demanding dignity, in the occupied territories is what Bibi forgot to mention. He dares evoke those u201Cextraordinary scenes in Tunis and Cairo,u201D likening them to what happened in Berlin and Prague in 1989. Yet surely he knows they are mustering their courage against the IDF, which is shooting them down in the streets of occupied Palestine. Somehow, I don't think Bibi means to praise these brave souls.

Bibi praises the u201CArab springu201D of democratic hope, and goes on to bemoan the snuffing out of hope u201Cin Tehran in 1979,u201D the year the mullahs triumphed in Iran. u201CYou may remember what happened then.u201D Yet does he remember the role played by Israel in those events? The Mossad helped set up the dreaded SAVAK, the Iranian Shah's ruthless secret police, which tortured and imprisoned many thousands, and crushed all opponents of the regime. This bit of history is neglected by the Prime Minister, whose memory is necessarily selective.

741320,"This past week has been a very turbulent time for Italy. And it wasn’t just the grounding of the Concordia cruise ship by a playboy captain; but the grounding of the country by Euro-technocrat usurper Darth Monti, trying to impress his Keynesian buddies with his latest attempts to Save Italy!

This week saw the launch of a popular uprising in Sicily, by a group known as the Movimento dei Forconi or Pitchfork Movement. This is not an uprising of self absorbed youth who want more government handouts; but of producers who are being pushed into poverty by government taxes and regulation. The organizers are middle aged and older; this is significant, as most power and wealth is held by this generation and they have now drawn a line in the sand.

On the 16th of January these protesters began ""Operazione Vespri Siciliani"", a blockade of the Island of Sicily. Within two days the transportation of all goods was stopped. Over the next week, nothing entered or exited Sicily. This was no mean feat given that Sicily is not a small Island; it has a population of over five million people and a surface area of 25,711 km2.

These are some of their demands:

The arrest of all corrupt politicians.

To reduce the number of parliamentarians.

To remove the provincial bureaucracy, as most of these politicians have been there for over forty years.

To drastically cut the salaries and privileges of parliamentarians and senators.

To restrict politicians two only two terms in office

Not one of Darth Montis austerity measures has touched the political caste; in fact in classic Italian style, the press has dug up some very dirty scandals concerning two of his fellow tax-feeders.

The trigger for these events was the vampire state sinking its fangs deeper into the already hampered Italian economy; a vicious tax was added to petrol, diesel and other energy sources in December.

Though agriculture contributes only 2.5% of GDP, in the southern regions of Basilicata, Calabria, and Molise, agriculture accounts for just over 20 percent of local employment. Many goods are transported by road, and as the cost of transport went through the roof within the time frame of just a few weeks, it destroyed the farmer’s tight margins. Why work when the state steals most of your profits?

To further understand the rage, despair and humiliation it is necessary to know some Sicilian history. As Jeff says, its all been done before.

In the year 1282 the War of the Sicilian Vespers was fought by the Sicilians against the French aristocracy that ruled Sicily at the time. This uprising was ignited by excessive taxation and mismanagement by the French. Fast forward to 1859; Sicily was part of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies. At the time it was the richest kingdom in the Mediterranean and its capitol Napoli was one of the most renowned and cultured cities in the world. Then in 1860, The House of Savoy, rulers of the Kingdom of Italy, decided to liberate the south from their brutal oppressors. The newly liberated soon realized that they were tax slaves to yet another foreign power. This necessitated the stationing of 200,000 troops in the south to prevent further rebellions. One could say that this occupation still exists today, as no Italian troops are ever garrisoned in their home regions.

After a hundred and fifty years the south is still suffering the effects of this occupation, but now the roles have been reversed; the wealth of the north is confiscated by Rome to bribe subsidise the corrupt politicians of the south. This is one of the reasons why Lega Nord is so popular in the North.

It will be interesting to see what happens next, as the protests are soon moving to Rome. This is not necessarily a positive move, as every political movement (eg. Lega Nord) that has gone onto Rome, has been bought off and betrayed their ideals. Over the past week, the establishment, including the unions have been deeply humiliated and lost a lot of credibility. There has been very little media coverage; the news still has to breach the international mainstream media (MSM) Firewall.

As Italy falls deeper into depression, the establishment will lose further credibility; regional movements such as the Forconi will multiply, putting further pressure on the State. This could well be the beginning of the end for the Italian state as Darth Montis taxes push more people unto the street.

For those who want to follow this story, you can use #Forconi hashtag on twitter. There are a few English speaking writers who are reporting from Sicily.

170732,"“There have been times when they slip back into Cold War thinking,” said President Obama in his tutorial with Jay Leno.

And to show the Russians that such Cold War thinking is antiquated, Obama canceled his September summit with Vladimir Putin.

The reason: Putin’s grant of asylum to Edward Snowden, who showed up at the Moscow airport, his computers full of secrets that our National Security Agency has been thieving from every country on earth, including Russia.

Yet there are many KGB defectors in the United States, and Russia has never used this as an excuse to cancel a summit.

The Washington Post and Wall Street Journal are delighted, hopeful that cancellation presages a more confrontational policy toward Putin.

But is a second Cold War really a good idea? And if it is coming, who is more responsible for it?

From 1989 to 1991, Mikhail Gorbachev agreed to let Eastern Europe go free and withdraw his troops and tank armies back to the Urals. The Soviet Union was allowed to dissolve into 15 nations. In three years, the USSR gave up an empire, a third of its territory, and half its people.

And it extended to us a hand of friendship.

How did we respond? We pushed NATO right up to Russia’s borders, bringing in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria, even former Soviet republics Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.

European objections alone prevented us from handing out NATO war guarantees to Ukraine and Georgia. Was this a friendly act?

Would we have regarded post-Cold War Russian alliances with Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Mexico as friendly acts?

To cut Moscow out of the Caspian Sea oil, we helped build a pipeline through two former Soviet republics, Azerbaijan and Georgia, and, thence, under the Black Sea to our NATO ally Turkey.

In the Boris Yeltsin decade, the 1990s, U.S. hustlers colluded with local oligarchs in looting Russia of her natural resources.

In the past decade, the National Endowment for Democracy and its Republican and Democratic subsidiaries helped dump over governments in Serbia, Ukraine and Georgia, and replace them with regimes friendlier to us and more distant from Moscow.

George W. Bush sought to put an anti-missile system in Poland and the Czech Republic. Neither country had requested it. We said it was aimed at Iran.

When my late friend, columnist Tony Blankley, visited Russia in the Bush II era, he was astounded at the hostility he encountered from Russians who felt we had responded to their offer of friendship at the end of the Cold War by taking advantage of them.

Putin is a former intelligence officer, a patriot, a nationalist.

How did we think he would react to U.S. encirclement of his country by NATO and U.S. meddling in his internal affairs?

How did American patriots in the Truman-McCarthy era react to the discovery that Hollywood, the U.S. government and our atom bomb project were riddled with communists loyal to Josef Stalin?

Why cannot we Americans see ourselves as others see us?

Why is Russia still supporting the brutal regime of Bashar Assad in Syria, the Post and Journal demand to know.

Well, Russia has a long relationship with the Assad family, selling it arms and maintaining a naval base on Syria’s coast. Did we expect Russia to behave as we did when our autocratic ally of 30 years, Hosni Mubarak, was challenged by crowds in Tahrir Square?

We ditched Mubarak and washed our hands of him in weeks.

Russia stood by its man. And does not Putin have a point when he asks why we are backing Syrian rebels among whom are elements of that same al-Qaida that killed thousands of us in the twin towers?

Is the Syrian war so clear-cut a case of good and evil that the Russians should dump their friends and support ours?

If the Assad family is irredeemably wicked, why did George H.W. Bush enlist Hafez Assad in his war to liberate Kuwait in 1991, a war to which Damascus contributed 4,000 troops?

There is another reason Russia is recoiling from America.

With the death of its Marxist-Leninist ideology, Russia is moving back toward its religious and Orthodox roots. Secretly baptized at birth by his mother, Putin has embraced this.

Increasingly, religious Russians look on America, with our Hollywood values and celebrations of homosexuality, as a sick society, a focus of cultural and moral evil in the world.

Much of the Islamic world that once admired America has reached the same conclusion. Yet the Post is demanding that our government stand with “the persecuted rock band” of young women who desecrated with obscene acts the high altar of Moscow’s most sacred cathedral.

Upon what ground do we Americans, 53 million abortions behind us since Roe v. Wade, stand to lecture other nations on morality?

Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, trade, arms reduction — we have fish to fry with Putin. As for our lectures on democracy and morality, how ’bout we put a sock in it?

468022,"Recently by Mark Nestmann: Mexico Reforms Its Immigration Laws

There are several ways that a U.S. citizen can expatriate; i.e., end their U.S. citizen status.

A U.S. citizen loses nationality by voluntarily performing any of the following acts with the intention of relinquishing U.S. nationality:

Being naturalized in a foreign country. Taking an oath or similar declaration of allegiance to a foreign state. Entering, or serving in, the armed forces of a foreign state if (A) such armed forces are engaged in hostilities against the United States, or (B) serving as a commissioned or non-commissioned officer. (A) Working for a foreign government as a citizen of that government; or (B) if such work requires an oath of allegiance or similar declaration. Making a formal renunciation of nationality before a diplomatic or consular officer of the United States in a foreign state. Making a formal renunciation of nationality in the United States in wartime. Committing treason, attempting by force to overthrow, or bearing arms against, the United States.

(Several of these actions require that you be at least 18 years old for them to be effective.)

The overwhelming majority of individuals who voluntarily expatriate do so under options #1 or #5. For instance, obtaining a second passport from another country (#1) is an expatriating act. If you choose to expatriate after doing so, that is your right under U.S. law.

In the past, Ive generally advised clients who have used our services to help them expatriate to avoid renouncing their citizenship (option #5). The reason is an obscure law enacted in 1996 called the Reed amendment. This law gives the U.S. Attorney General the discretion to deny entry into the United States to a former U.S. citizen who renounces U.S. citizenship in order to avoid U.S. taxation. Other categories of excluded persons are those with communicable diseases or other health conditions; those convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude or illegal drugs or with multiple criminal convictions; prostitutes; spies; terrorists; and draft evaders.

Because the wording of the Reed amendment appears to apply only to those who renounce U.S. citizenship, Ive recommended to our clients that they choose another expatriation option other than renunciation. Generally this is #1, in which you acquire a foreign nationality and subsequently relinquish U.S. citizenship.

However, 15 years after its original enactment, regulations under the Reed amendment have not been promulgated, nor has its power ever officially been invoked. One reason is that the law is so extreme that even that paragon of civil liberties, former Attorney General Janet Reno, questioned its constitutionality.

Another reason is that the law is likely obsolete. The tax law that discourages expatriation no longer requires that a persons expatriation be tax-motivated to come into effect. Anyone who meets the criteria to be defined as a covered expatriate is subject to it. Among other consequences, covered expatriates must pay an exit tax on unrealized gains that exceed $$636,000 (indexed annually for inflation). Your motivation for expatriation is irrelevant.

These facts havent stopped U.S. consular officials from occasionally denying visa applications from former U.S. citizens, apparently using the Reed amendment as legal authority for doing so. In another case, U.S. customs officials used the Reed amendment as justification to deny a former U.S. citizen permission to board a U.S.-borne jet. Fortunately, the situation was quickly resolved in favor of the former U.S. citizen seeking to re-enter the United States.

The officials apparently made no effort to determine if the targeted individuals had renounced  or merely relinquished  their U.S. citizenship. In addition, the State Department helpfully lumps anyone who U.S. citizen who expatriates into a single category, which it calls renunciants.

These facts make the distinction Ive made between renunciation and relinquishment largely irrelevant. As the procedure for renunciation is simpler, and removes any question of intent, I no longer see any reason to avoid this option.

Why might you wish to give up U.S. citizenship? One possible reason, of course, is that you no longer need to pay U.S. tax on your worldwide income if you reside outside the United States. Another reason is that youll find it much easier to invest or do business overseas as a non-U.S. citizen.

My newly revised report, The Billionaires Loophole, describes these advantages, and outlines the procedure for giving up citizenship, step-by-step. It also shows you practical ways to avoid the exit tax and other consequences of being a covered expatriate. Fortunately, you dont need to be a billionaire to benefit from expatriation.

461733,"Recently by Thomas R. Eddlem: Ron Paul Coup in Minnesota GOP

The United Nations is polishing up a global Arms Transfer Treaty (ATT) this month in a New York convention that would create a global registry of private ownership of firearms. This treaty  which would also mandate creation of a national collection agency for those guns and is contrary to the U.S. Constitution’s Second Amendment  has the long-standing and enthusiastic backing of the Obama State Department, headed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

u201CConventional arms transfers are a crucial national security concern for the United States, and we have always supported effective action to control the international transfer of arms,u201D Hillary Clinton noted as early as October 14, 2009. Clinton boasted that u201Cthe United States regularly engages other states to raise their standards and to prohibit the transfer or transshipment of capabilities to rogue states, terrorist groups, and groups seeking to unsettle regions.u201D Of course, that speech was delivered at the same time the Obama administration was transferring some 2,000 small arms to Mexican drug gangs in the u201CFast and Furiousu201D gun-walking scandal.

The State Department website nevertheless absurdly continues to boast that u201CThe United States has in place an extensive and rigorous system of controls that most agree is the ‘gold standard’ of export controls for arms transfers.u201D

In view of such obviously false public statements, one may question the sincerity of Obama State Department promises about u201Credlinesu201D to the UN ATT, which supposedly protect the Second Amendment: u201CThe Second Amendment to the Constitution must be upheld. There will be no restrictions on civilian possession or trade of firearms otherwise permitted by law or protected by the U.S. Constitution. There will be no dilution or diminishing of sovereign control over issues involving the private acquisition, ownership, or possession of firearms, which must remain matters of domestic law.u201D The Obama State Department also promises u201CThere will be no mandate for an international body to enforce an ATT.u201D

So America’s Second Amendment rights are safe, right?

Hardly.

The draft of the treaty prepared earlier this year by the UN Preparatory Committee (PrepCom) explains that the treaty is aimed at crime control as well as rogue militias in developing nations:

The majority of conflict deaths are caused by the use of small arms, and civilian populations bear the brunt of armed conflict more than ever. Also, small arms are the dominant tools of criminal violence.

The PrepCom report of February 2012  despite protestations by the Hillary Clinton’s minions  is not limited merely to international transfer of firearms. The draft treaty covers u201Ctransfersu201D as well as imports and exports of firearms:

The international transactions or activities covered by this Treaty include those listed below and defined in Annex A:

(a) Import;

(b) Export;

(c) Transfer…

In this matter, the 2012 conference is merely following the goals of the 2001 UN Programme of Action on small arms, which required national gun registries and collection agencies for those guns once they’ve been registered. The 2001 Programme of Action requires nations:

To ensure that comprehensive and accurate records are kept for as long as possible on the manufacture, holding and transfer of small arms and light weapons under their jurisdiction. These records should be organized and maintained in such a way as to ensure that accurate information can be promptly retrieved and collated by competent national authorities.

To develop and implement, where possible, effective disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes, including the effective collection, control, storage and destruction of small arms and light weapons…

The UN is still seeking this kind of broad control over private firearms ownership, and UN General Assembly resolution 66/47, adopted December 2, 2011 in advance of this month’s conference that it seeks to ban u201CThe illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects.u201D [Emphasis added]

220801,"I begin with a statement. Would you say it sounds Keynesian?

The continuing slowness of economic growth in high-income economies has prompted soul-searching among economists. They have looked to weak demand, rising inequality, Chinese competition, over-regulation, inadequate infrastructure and an exhaustion of new technological ideas as possible culprits.An additional explanation of slow growth is now receiving attention, however. It is the persistence and expectation of peace. The world just hasn’t had that much warfare lately, at least not by historical standards. Some of the recent headlines about Iraq or South Sudan make our world sound like a very bloody place, but today’s casualties pale in light of the tens of millions of people killed in the two world wars in the first half of the 20th century. Even the Vietnam War had many more deaths than any recent war involving an affluent country. Counterintuitive though it may sound, the greater peacefulness of the world may make the attainment of higher rates of economic growth less urgent and thus less likely.

This sounds Keynesian to me. The fact that it appears in The New York Times also leads me to conclude that it is Keynesian. Where Keynes Went Wron... Hunter Lewis Best Price: $$2.99 Buy New $$7.95 (as of 03:00 EST - Details)

But, no, the author assures us, this is not Keynesian at all. “This view does not claim that fighting wars improves economies, as of course the actual conflict brings death and destruction. The claim is also distinct from the Keynesian argument that preparing for war lifts government spending and puts people to work.”

Rather, the very possibility of war focuses the attention of governments on getting some basic decisions right — whether investing in science or simply liberalizing the economy. Such focus ends up improving a nation’s longer-run prospects. War is a Racket: The A... Smedley D. Butler Best Price: $$2.97 Buy New $$3.84 (as of 12:35 EST - Details)

Does this make sense to you? It makes no sense to me.

It was written by Tyler Cowen, who teaches economics at George Mason University. He is regarded as a free market economist. I do not know why.

It may seem repugnant to find a positive side to war in this regard, but a look at American history suggests we cannot dismiss the idea so easily.

Anatomy of the State Murray Rothbard Best Price: $$3.75 (as of 01:20 EST - Details) Yes, we can. Quite easily. You would be hard-pressed to find a war in American history that did not raise taxes, raise debt, and kill innocent people. Nevertheless, I have recommended to my friend Tom Woods that he write a series of books on America’s wars. He should also produce video lectures. There are at least 20 of these wars. I want him to cover each war in three chapters: (1) how the government got us into the war; (2) how the government raised taxes and increased debt to fight the war; (3) how the economy was worse off after the war ended, and maybe society, too. Dr. Woods is the right man to write this series. He should use the books by Robert Higgs as the foundation, especially Crisis and Leviathan. Dr. Cowen continues.

Fundamental innovations such as nuclear power, the computer and the modern aircraft were all pushed along by an American government eager to defeat the Axis powers or, later, to win the Cold War. The Internet was initially designed to help this country withstand a nuclear exchange, and Silicon Valley had its origins with military contracting, not today’s entrepreneurial social media start-ups.

We have heard this before. Frederic Bastiat wrote about it in 1850. It is called the fallacy of the broken window.

What about nuclear power? That was based on Rutherford’s splitting of the atom in 1932. The U. S. government sped up nuclear research, but with a purpose: to incinerate civilians. It then nuked Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which had no military targets. This was not collateral damage. This was a way to scare the USSR.

214866,"Freakonomics by Steven Levitt contains some good true-life statistical detective stories. Levitt has tracked down teachers in the Chicago public school system who fake their student’s results on end-of-year achievement tests; he even got some of them fired. He has identified match-fixing practices among the elite in Sumo wrestling. He bravely criticizes the Ku Klux Klan. But when it comes to taking on more powerful foes, he suddenly develops a selective blindness and fails to see anything to question about the economics of compulsory state schools, drug prohibition, gun control, or any of America’s other herds of sacred buffalo.

His most valuable work is his unmasking of cheating teachers. He examined 700,000 sets of test answers, searching for the telltale pattern of lazy cheating: classes where every student miraculously got the same fifteen answers correct in a row. (In one example case, all the students then got the next question wrong… apparently the cheating teacher couldn’t answer the question correctly either). In follow-up checks, he readministered the tests to 120 classes, finding that the scores were significantly lower than when the teachers monitored the tests.

It is useful for parents to know that a ""high-scoring"" public school may simply be one that cheats more. It would be even more useful in an economics book for the author to question the economics and incentives of compulsory public schools; unfortunately Levitt declined to do so.

I will pass over his excellent analysis of Sumo match-fixing; a world with morally pure Sumo wrestlers might be a better world, but I don’t think I would notice the difference in my daily life.

He starts to veer away from the data and back into conventionality when dealing with the socially pressing issue of racism among users of online dating services. He concludes that white men are racist because ""they sent 90 percent of their e-mail queries to white women."" Is it possible that more white women than black used Internet dating services at that time? Is it possible that the men were discriminating on economic or cultural grounds? We can’t tell from the data, so apparently we are just supposed to assume that white men are bigoted.

The chapter on crack dealers claims to have detailed information of the account books of a large gang in Chicago. (Hint to grad students: this is a great idea for keeping your advisor from checking your work; he’s not going to go into the projects and look at the books of any drug gangs). While a business case study of an illegal drug gang may have merit, it is useless without comparison to legal drug sales. Nicotine is the most addictive drug, yet there are no shootouts associated with its use. Levitt never deals with the issue of drug prohibition itself, so the chapter is trivial and superficial.

Once he get into gun control, the scientific method goes out the window. He does admit that gun control programs are not associated with lower crime. However, the pervasive assumption throughout the chapter is that ""people don’t kill people, guns kill people."" To quote: ""The typical gun buyback program yields fewer than 1,000 guns — which translates into an expectation of less than one-tenth of one homicide per buyback."" He means, of course, a reduction of less than one-tenth of one homicide per buyback, but the actual text is closer to the truth. Buyback users aren’t random! They do not include the set of premeditated murderers! Buybacks, like the US ""nuclear nonproliferation"" policy, only disarm the peaceful.

The same error continues into the chapter on child safety. He points out that 550 children die in swimming pools every year, while only 175 are shot to death. He then extrapolates that the risk of allowing a child to play where ""the parents keep a gun in the house"" is 100 times less than the risk of allowing them to go to a house with a pool. This assumes that all children are killed with guns that are owned by their friend’s parents; a highly questionable assumption. Is it not possible that guns in the hands of parents might actually keep the children safer? Levitt doesn’t make the effort to ask.

So, is this a terrible book? No. Within the permissible limits of conventional wisdom, there are some thought-provoking paragraphs. But it is sad that someone can think so clearly and work so tirelessly when weeding out bad public-school teachers and Sumo wrestlers, but find it too frightening to expose the economic damage done by the privileged and powerful cheats of all kinds.

""Mr. President, this is Governor Lutrin and I am calling on behalf of the nation of Idaho and the new Inland Confederation.""

""Good evening, Governor Lutrin, I was hoping we could discuss a resolution to the latest…unpleasantness.""

""Mr. President, I wanted to pass on to you my personal assurance on the territorial integrity of the remaining states in the former union known as these United States. The departure of Utah, Wyoming, Montana and eastern Washington into the newly revived Articles of Confederation was a happenstance our exit did not anticipate. We have no intention whatsoever of seeking additional members although I suspect your behavior has provided a tremendous incentive to cause more states to spin off from the orbit of DC. I would like to recommend the creation of a Summit to establish a peaceful reconciliation between the divorced parties to normalize trade and diplomatic relations.""

""Governor, your actions have caused a cascading effect that has effectively opened national fissures that are difficult to contain.""

""I would also like to offer my concerns on repatriating the surviving members of the 82d Airborne Division and elements of the XVIII Airborne Corps. Both battalions of the 19th Special Forces Group (Airborne) are remaining in the Confederation of their own accord to husband the creation of our own national militia. The critically wounded soldiers will receive the best care we can offer through their recovery and eventual return to your country. We have already dispatched the surviving 35 paratroopers to the border for return. I am hopeful we can sustain the agreed terms of the ceasefire and avoid any bloodshed in the future.""

""That was the most lopsided defeat of American arms on our soil since…""

""Sir, we initiated no aggression against these United States and simply did what we tend to do best when our backs are against the wall. We are a rural nation with urban pockets and the character of these states tend to be rather impatient with being pushed around and bullied. Consider us as a porcupine that can do you no harm unless you visit violence on it. You can say that the fury your armed forces experienced was a century of pent-up frustration and aggression. Their sacrifice and bravery is acknowledged.""

""The US is the most sophisticated and powerful military power on the face of the planet. If I simply picked up the phone and called for air strikes or military reprisals, we could bring you to your knees.""

""That would be inadvisable to visit that kind of bloodshed on peaceful people. That particular scenario is not working very well for you in the Middle East. I would also hope severe condemnations from civilized nations around the world would grace your desk. I can promise you that we will initiate a number of retaliatory measures which require no military action on our behalf that will cause a modicum of grief to your administration""

""Such as…""

""Inspired by a terrific novel called Enemies Foreign and Domestic, we happen to have a complete database of all current physical addresses of all FLEAs (Federal Law Enforcement Agent) in the US available for broadcast release on the internet when we choose.""

""I have filed a formal complaint with the United Nations Security Council to issue an injunction against your secession.""

""We cannot tell you who to associate with but we are not nor will we be members of the United Nations. We already have formal recognition from 55 nations including Alaska, Switzerland, Russia and France where we are establishing formal consular offices. We have formalized the transfer of all nuclear weapons and military facilities on Confederation soil and will reimburse the US Government for their costs after the auditors have finished calculating the total Confederation tax bill bled to the rulers on the Potomac since 1913. Unfortunately, I suspect the books may not balance in your favor so receipt of the funds in actual remuneration may not materialize.""

""Governor, that is clear and simple theft of US Government property to include the multibillion dollar facilities.""

""Mr. President, taxation is theft and the weight of Federal encroachment on the states has been enormous. Once DC started to behave like an occupation government, all the natural forces seeking remedy and escape started to form the perfect storm of events that liberated the Confederation from the former US configuration. We will conduct a full accounting of the valuation and match it to the previously mentioned audit. We have no Federal Reserve and the Confederation will be relying on free banking to mint a new currency or currencies backed by hard metal. What little government we have will be financed through a one percent tariff at the borders.""

""Governor, how can a government run on a one percent tax?""

""Mr. President, that is the original percentage of the income tax in 1913. We have already cashiered 98% of government workers in most of the states in the last two weeks. This includes the former Federal employees who chose to remain here. Each employee received the equivalent of five years salary in gold drawn from the caged IRS account in Boise. They are among the last people we hope will ever get government aid in the state. We have a unique agenda, we intend to shrink government over time and if the future allows us to zero it completely, so be it.""

""That is impossible, how will people survive without government support and protection?""

735806,"The campaign against one of the greatest Americans ever continues. The Richmond-area Boy Scouts have stripped Robert E. Lee's name from their uniforms, title, and logo.

How sad, given that Lee's life, and the maxims by which he lived, are exactly what the growing generation of boys in this country needs.

Everyone knows why the Scouts dropped the name, but the reason is unimportant. The important thing is the example of manhood of which the Scouts are deprived.

Lee's Life

Many have used superlatives to describe Lee. Lee was ""the most perfect man I have ever met … made of different and finer metal than other men,"" one admirer said. ""He is an epistle,"" said another, ""written of God.""

Lee lived by the code of honor and chivalry. He embodied dignity, manly bearing, and valor. A pious Christian, his principal object was doing God's will.

Lee's code can be found in a small volume called The Maxims of Robert E. Lee for Young Gentlemen, published by Virginia Gentlemen Books and the source of the quote used here.

A humble man, Lee once said, ""I know of nothing good I could tell you of myself."" Indeed, he would likely say the Scouts should have taken a different man's name.

As president of Washington College, he shaped the lives of many young men. ""You cannot be a true man,"" he told his students, ""unless you learn to obey.""

""Study hard,"" he told them, ""be always a gentleman, live cleanly and remember God."" And he once told Stonewall Jackson's minister, ""I dread the thought of any student going away from the college without becoming a sincere Christian.""

""Do your duty,"" he wrote to son Custis. ""That is all the pleasure, all the comfort, all the glory we can enjoy in this world.""

""We must all try to be good Christians,"" he said to a 5-year-old boy, ""that is the most important thing.""

The stories that demonstrate Lee's character are legion and cannot be repeated here.

Whom Would They Revere?

Boy Scouts should be clamoring to adopt Lee's name.

But no. They erased it.

And to be replaced by whom? Arthur Ashe, a tennis player? There's a statue of him in Richmond. How about Abe Lincoln, the American man-god, whom we are supposed to worship with sacrilegious veneration, and whose effigy recently arose amid the streets of Richmond?

Perhaps the Scouts can learn to emulate him.

Perhaps they will learn to regale their friends with jokes so filthy the women and children must leave the room, or to laugh at the misfortune of others, as Lincoln laughed when Gen. Sherman told him about burning Georgia. Perhaps they will learn to lie and exhibit false piety.

What A Boy Scout Should Be

Modern Scouts likely never learned much about Lee, but removing his name certainly won't help matters. Lee's example is sorely, desperately needed in a society that produces video games in which men maim women, and music videos in which singers gleefully advocate rape and murder.

What kind of boy was Lee?

""He was a most exemplary student,"" a teacher said. ""He was never behind-time in his studies; never failed a single recitation; was perfectly observant of the rules and regulations of the institution; was gentle, manly, unobtrusive, and respectful in all his deportment to this teachers and his fellow students.""

Sounds like what a Boy Scout should be.

Resolution of an unsolved scandalous rumor concerning a long-forgotten presidential peccadillo has been confirmed by DNA testing. President Warren Gamaliel Harding was indeed the father of mistress Nan Britton’s “love child.” Years after Harding’s sudden and abrupt death while in office, Britton attempted to publish The President’s Daughter, an account of their affair.

Unable to find a publisher who was willing to publish and distribute the book, the book was published by the Elizabeth Ann Guild, an organization that Britton founded to take up the cause of children born out of wedlock. Prior to its release, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice (the same organization once headed by Anthony Comstock) arranged for the New York City Police to seize both the unbound printed sheets and the zinc printing plates; all materials were returned to the Elizabeth Ann Guild. Prior to publication, Congressman John Tillman (D-Arkansas) introduced a bill into the United States House of Representatives attempting to ban the sale of the book stating that the work was “a blast from Hell“. Tillman also cited his belief that book was written by a man, not Britton. The measure failed.

The book languished unsold until America’s most famous and controversial journalist, H. L. Mencken, published a review of it in the Baltimore Evening Sun on July 18, 1927. The volume soon soared to best-seller status.

Besides the Britton affair, historical appraisal of Harding and his administration has been interesting. The vast majority of court historians deem it one of the worst, citing the Tea Pot Dome and ancillary scandals. While select revisionists (particularly those of a libertarian nature) praise its foreign and domestic policies, most notably Harding’s treatment of the Depression of 1921 and his clemency of the imprisoned Socialist presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs. Essentially Harding’s corrupt crony corporatist administration is praised because it was not that of its proto-fascist progressive predecessor Woodrow Wilson. Reminds me of the shrill and venomous partisanship by acolytes of the Bush and Obama regimes, overlooking the undeniable similarity of their Deep State reality.

During a recent campaign swing in New York, Vice President Al Gore spoke at a Hasidic synagogue. As would be the case with any service conducted by this ultra-Orthodox Jewish group, the males filed into the seats, while their wives, daughters, and sisters took their places outside the assembly. Women did not take part in the service and were not even in the same room as the men.

No journalist afterward questioned Gore's commitment to women's rights, and Gore's political opponents attacked neither the vice president nor the synagogue where the service was held. This hands-off stance by the press was as it should have been, as individuals should be free to practice voluntary religious beliefs without government interference.

Unfortunately, George Bush, Jr., has not been a recipient of this same beneficence by the media. The recent attacks on Bush for having spoken to an assembly at Bob Jones University in South Carolina have not only damaged the Bush campaign, they also point to a more ominous trend in church/state relations. The politicians, in their frenzied zeal to win, and the media, ever in search of a controversy, have let an evil genie out of the bottle. It is not overstating the case to say that the current political climate is laying the groundwork for the end of religious freedom as we have known it since the founding of this republic. Even Bush's most recent primary victories in Virginia and Washington do not change that situation.

For most of the media and political candidates, the story is simple. When Bush spoke at BJU, a fundamentalist Christian university in Greenville that does not permit its students to engage in interracial dating, he failed to condemn that policy. Nor did Bush denounce statements made by the late Bob Jones II  the university's former president and father of current president Bob Jones III  that that the Pope is the Antichrist and that the Roman Catholic Church, along with the Mormon Church, are cults.

The first policy, according to the media critics, is racist, while the second amounts to religious bigotry. Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal condemned Bob Jones III as a ""bigot"", reiterating his denunciation on a recent edition of the ""Capital Gang."" His colleague Mark Shields declared the people at BJU to be ""the cast of u2018Deliverance'."" Not to be undone, Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-SC, called BJU ""a national embarrassment"" and said he would sign a U.S. Senate resolution condemning the university. Sen. Robert Toricelli, D-NJ, is now in the process of preparing such an article of condemnation. According to these folks, fundamentalist Christian beliefs constitute bigotry, and all bigotry must be met by the full force of the law.

John McCain's campaign turned the controversy into a frenzy by calling Roman Catholics in Michigan to remind them of Bush's appearance at BJU. The tactics worked, as enraged Catholic voters, many of them Democrats, crowded the Michigan polls en masse to vote against Bush. The McCain campaign is doing the same thing with Mormons in Utah in preparation for the primary there. But while religious controversy worked to McCain's favor in Michigan, in the long term he, the media, and many Democrats have placed religious liberty in peril, as they have made political issues out of sectarian differences.

Even though it seems that McCain's recent attacks on Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell actually might have worked against him, there is something more sinister about his religious scorched earth policy. For one, even though McCain has criticized Bush for not denouncing BJU's rules during his speech at the college, McCain also had an opportunity to do the same, but passed on it.

What few voters know, since the media did not report it, was that McCain met with many top people from Bob Jones University during a church service the week before the South Carolina primary. Originally scheduled to speak at Second Presbyterian Church in Greenville, McCain decided instead to accept an invitation to appear at Hampton Park Baptist Church, which is known in Greenville as ""The Bob Jones Church.""

Bob Jones III, most of his family, most top administrators, and many students from BJU either attend Hampton Park on a regular basis or are members there. Thus, when McCain spoke to his audience, he in effect was speaking to the majority of people who make the rules governing BJU. He was not ignorant of this fact, as his former South Carolina co-chairman, Terry Haskins, himself a BJU graduate, had informed him.

Instead of delivering a blistering condemnation of BJU for ""religious bigotry,"" McCain instead gave his standard conservative stump speech. After he lost in South Carolina, however, McCain then decided that BJU was actually a den of racists and bigots. Before the vote, however, he competed with both Bush and Alan Keyes for the BJU faithful on their terms.

While some politicians and the media may decry what may seem to be bigotry on the part of Bob Jones University, there are issues of religious orthodoxy that cannot be resolved in a state-sponsored sensitivity training session. There are major differences in the doctrinal statements of Protestantism and Roman Catholicism, some of which are mutually exclusive. The Roman doctrines hammered out at the Council of Trent from 1545 to 1563 declared that those who held Protestant beliefs were “anathema,” which means they were accursed. Vatican Council II from 1962 to 1965 relaxed some of those doctrines, calling Protestants “separated brethren,” but great differences remain between the two Christian groups.

These doctrinal stands on behalf of the Roman Church do not constitute bigotry against Protestants. Rather, they reflect honest differences in how these two divisions of the Christian Church interpret the Bible and the work of Christ. In is in this light that people should examine the policies of Bob Jones University and of other religious organizations.

There are many religious beliefs and practices that violate the political zeitgeist. Many Christian churches, including the Roman Catholic, Southern Baptist, and Presbyterian Church in America, refuse to ordain women to the ministry, citing the letters of St. Paul, which they hold to be sacred writings.

The clash of the prohibition of female ministers with modern political beliefs was highlighted by the unsuccessful attempt by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools to deny accreditation to Westminster Theological Seminary of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Westminster has only ordained Presbyterian ministers from conservative denominations on its board of trustees, which means its board is all-male.

Middle States tried to refuse reaccreditation to Westminster because of its all-male board and would have been successful, had not then-U.S. Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander intervened. There is almost no doubt that the Clinton Administration or a future administration of Al Gore or Bill Bradley would side against this seminary and its policies. In the future, one can expect a major push by the Democrats to assail those denominations which do not ordain women or homosexuals.

The first line of attack against churches and other religious organizations is harassment by the Internal Revenue Service. In 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with the IRS in stripping Bob Jones University of tax-exempt status for its policy against interracial dating. Never mind that BJU says it has the practice because the administrators there believe that is what the Bible teaches. Never mind that African American students at BJU are treated far better than black students at many of this country's elite universities, and that the policies are applied equally to all students, not just to those of one race.

In ruling against Bob Jones, the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declared, ""Certain governmental interests are so compelling that conflicting religious practices must yield in their favor."" With those words, the court made government the final arbiter of true religious orthodoxy. Religious groups are not free to practice their own beliefs, even if those beliefs harm no individuals. Had BJU's policies resulted in violence against a person, including murder, assault, or theft, the state would indeed have a legitimate reason to intervene. However, it must be emphasized that BJU is a voluntary society; people choose to attend of their own free will. The university's administration does not coerce anyone into being at BJU. Questions of whether or not the Bible permits interracial marriage among Christians or allows women to become priests are issues to be decided by theologians, not the state, and certainly not the IRS.

Because Bible fundamentalists like those at BJU are a tiny minority in our society, they are easy targets for politicians and journalists who disagree with them. The courts, however, have not singled out only Bob Jones in compelling Christian organizations to act against their own orthodox beliefs. A federal court recently forced Georgetown University, a Roman Catholic institution, to recognize a gay rights organization as an official campus club. University officials argued that Roman Catholic beliefs teach homosexuality is sin, but, again, the courts cited the ""compelling interests"" of the state in its decision.

With these anti-religion building blocks laid by the courts, it is no wonder that governments at all levels have become emboldened to act against churches. A Portland, Oregon, environmental official recently ordered a church in that city to stop feeding hungry people and restricted Sunday worship to 70 worshipers, despite the fact that the sanctuary can seat 500 people.

Perhaps the most ominous sign of encroachment by the state came last summer when Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Washington, sent a ""Dear Colleague"" letter to each member of the U.S. House of Representatives in which he denounced the Southern Baptist Convention for its efforts to convert Hindus to Christianity. McDermott later wrote the Convention itself, stating, ""We cannot understand how men and women, raised and educated in the world's bastion of religious freedom and tolerance, can characterize another religion as spiritually dark and false.""

These words clearly cross the line set by the framers of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. According to McDermott, because the United States practices political pluralism, no one should be permitted to try to convince an adherent of one religion to voluntarily convert to another. (Does this also mean McDermott believes that Democrats should not try to convince Republicans to cross to the other side and vice versa?)

When members of Congress take the oath of office, they promise to ""protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" It seems that at least Rep. McDermott has decided to ignore his pledge.

Some of the presidential candidates have proven that attacks upon religious beliefs of some churches can successfully reap votes from people of opposing groups. Their actions, while politically popular in the short run, will have devastating long run consequences, for it sends the message that those in this country who hold religious beliefs that conflict with current political thought must be marginalized and ultimately punished. Politicians and their statist allies will become more and more emboldened in attacking Christians and others who hold minority beliefs. They have breached the true wall of separation of church and state, and only a concerted action by those who truly care about religious liberty can stop the impending tide.

217082,"Last week, we dropped ideas like breadcrumbs:

Jimmy Carter seems to have done “good” in Africa.

Poor Professor Stephen Walt doesn’t seem to realize that certain subjects are taboo.

Institutions, societies, bull markets. Everything degrades and degenerates.

And history? There would be no history without degeneration, without aging, and without death.

Big old trees, parasites, and the news media.

Today, we pick up the trail and see where it leads.

We begin with Jimmy Carter. According to the press reports, the former president has been successfully leading an effort to exterminate the “Guinea worm.” The worm is a parasite that — like many others — takes control of its host for its own purposes. The worm enters the body, bores its way toward the skin, and then lays its eggs under the skin. Along with the eggs, if we understood the biology of it, it sends out toxins that burn so painfully that the person rushes into the river to soothe them. At this moment, the larval worms burst through the skin, are released into the water, where then can then get picked up and imbibed by another person — so the cycle continues.

In this respect, the Guinea worm is little different from the common cold virus, which makes its host sneeze and cough on the subway so that it can spread to the other passengers as well.

As systems, organizations and institutions age, they become home to more and more parasites. Sometimes the opportunists are benign, like the tickbird hopping a ride on the back of the rhinoceros or a squirrel nesting in an old tree. Other times, they subvert the host or eat away at it.

After World War I, a Congressional hearing was called to try to understand how the United States got involved in such a pointless and disastrous conflict. Americans had no dog in that fight, but they went to war anyway. And inquiring minds wanted to know: why?

Because the republic had been subverted, came the answer. While the United States had nothing at stake in Europe’s war, the big banks did. They had lent millions to England and France. From their point of view, it was vital that the United States enter the war on the side of the English and French, which it did in 1917.

Now cometh another war and another question: Why would the United States want to get involved in a war against nobody, for no apparent reason? Weapons of Mass Destruction! Democracy! Terrorism! But, the slippery explanations dried up just after daylight for those looking for more practical explanations: Oil!

But — in the Middle East, at least — it is cheaper to buy oil than it is to steal it. Cheaper, that is, for the American consumers, which have to bear the costs. Whereupon, a Harvard professor, Stephen Walt, traipses in with another: Israel’s powerful Washington lobby redirected American foreign policy for its own interests.

We don’t know whether there is much truth to it, but it seems at least plausible enough to warrant investigation.

Everything degenerates, degrades, and ages, dear reader. We aren’t the first to notice. As institutions mature, more and more “parasites” find ways to game the system. They worm themselves into positions of power to protect their privileges. They nestle into cozy nests and comfy sinecures in the niches and crannies of the big, old oak. Of course, the press, the politicians, and the universities also attract parasites with their own agendas — their own axes to grind and necks to chop.

Poor Professor Walt! He didn’t seem to understand, until his own neck was stretched out upon the block. And where were the politicians? Where were the journalists? Here was a story bigger than Watergate. Was no one interested in getting to the bottom of it? Did no one fly to the professor’s aid? Were all hacks and the pols in on it? We looked in the International Herald Tribune again today. No mention of it. We checked twice — no Congressional hearings either.

And so, history rumbles on — eating away and subverting the institutions that were supposed to bring it to an end. A modern, open democracy was supposed to be “transparent.” The voters were supposed to be able to see how important decisions are made. The press would make sure of it. Congress would insist upon it. And then, the enlightened voters would go to the polls and do their duty — righting wrongs, correcting errors, and keeping the great ship moving ahead in the right direction. There would be no more upheavals, no revolutions, no convulsions. Never again would she run aground.

Falling rocks ahead!

u2022 More from Mondo Condo. An article by MSN’s Melinda Fulmer:

“After several years of gung-ho development in south Florida, San Diego, Las Vegas and other major markets, the once-hot condo market is headed for a slump.

“The national median price for existing condos rang in at $$228,200 in the fourth quarter of 2005 — a healthy 12.3% increase from a year ago, according to the National Association of Realtors. But in some of the most robust markets, where prices had soared in the past few years, appreciation slowed to a trickle:

“Condos in Atlanta went up just 3.7% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2005. Prices in San Diego bumped up just 1.7%. And in seven markets studied by NAR, such as Virginia Beach, Va. and Toledo, Ohio, prices actually dipped, mirroring the rest of the housing market.

“Agents and economists say they expect to see further erosion this year, as the housing market continues to cool. ‘There is reason to be concerned about the condo market right now,’ said Susan Wachter, professor of real estate and finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. ‘There is an all-time high of inventory right now and it is disproportional to condo markets,’ she said.

“Ryan Higgins, for his part, was undeterred by declining condo prices. The 29-year-old broker and mortgage lender from Carlsbad, Calif., recently decided to buy a $$585,000 three-bedroom condo in the chic La Costa area, despite seeing prices dip on many new projects. ‘Real estate is not a good short-term investment,’ he said. ‘Anyone could have made money in real estate in the last few years.’ Now, he said, you have to be patient, ‘buy in the right market and sustain some turbulence.’""

Turbulence? We remind readers that real property prices in central Baltimore declined for 75 years, after peaking in the mid-’20s. Farmland in western Kansas peaked in the 1880s, and has never recovered. Looking ahead, we suspect that suburban property on both coasts is now reaching an epochal high. We may never see such high prices again in our lifetimes.

u2022 Our old friend, Martin Spring, writes with some thoughts on pensions:

“In America, some large corporations face bankruptcy because of their pension fund liabilities — in the case of General Motors these are three times the value of its shares. Congress is currently hammering out a new law to force companies to fund their pension promises and pay more in premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which has a $$23 billion deficit.

“In Britain, companies are being forced to divert cashflow to clear the deficits in their funds within 10 years — the Pensions Regulator has started to use his new power to veto dividend increases.

“But it’s a problem that has much wider repercussions. It’s starting to embrace all sectors of society and to trigger the first skirmishes in the coming pension wars.

“In the United States, New York City transit authority workers recently went on strike to block a move to increase compulsory pension contributions by new employees from two to six percent.

“In the United Kingdom, a million local government workers went on strike to protest against plans to stop early retirements on full pensions, and the government has been castigated for giving bad advice to 85,000 workers about how secure their pension funds would be — then refusing to compensate them when the funds went bust.

“The scale of the emerging pensions problem is frightening.

“In Europe, the Kok Report recently warned that by mid-century the ratio of pensioners to active workers will double. Broadly speaking, that means the burden on the working population of supporting those who have retired will also double.

“In Britain, 97 of the 100 biggest listed companies have deficits in their pension funds, while the liabilities of unfunded schemes for public-sector employees, if taken into account, would more than double the national debt.

“In America, the gap between the cost of Social Security pensions, Medicare and future tax revenues to pay for them has been estimated at $$44 trillion, or four times GDP.

“At the heart of the worsening pensions-funding problem in the developed world is refusal to face up to the facts. There won’t be a problem in future if it’s tackled now, but doing so requires making substantial sacrifices now and for years to come.

“Very few are willing to do that.”

No, Martin, few people are willing to do that…not as long as things are going so well.

From Gawker media:

CBC News reports that Mayor Eddie Francis was “not happy” when told that one of the city’s shrubs had undergone a phallic makeover. “The bush was in the sculpture garden, and somebody took it upon themselves to reshape the bush into something that they wanted to see,” the city’s parks boss John Miceli told the Windsor Star. “Whoever did the shaping was pretty proficient at shaping bushes.”

Environmentalism, it’s been said, is the ideological luxury of city dwellers in modern life, for anyone who lives just outside an urban or suburban environment knows the truth: nature is vicious and cruel and works relentlessly to make the life of man a living Hell.

I was reminded of this when looking at the horrible, bloody gashes on my brother’s domesticated cat, a sweet animal that lives in harmony with his superiors, the human family that owns and cares for him. The violence had been inflicted by another cat, a wild animal that is much bigger and lacks the mirage of conscience that we try to infuse in our pets.

The wild animal arrives at the back porch of this house nestled in the country on the edge of the West Texas desert. When no one is looking, the wild animal terrorizes the domestic cat, stealing food, slashing at his fur and skin, and generally try to rid the world of its competition for survival.

One would think it would be easy enough to kill it, but it is cunning beyond all expectation. I wandered through the mesquite and wild grass looking for him, rifle in hand, but he knew where I was going and hid magnificently. Once I gave up he would appear again as if to taunt me. I would go out with the gun again, and it would start all over.

As my brother and I waited in silence by the reservoir, I noted a skull sitting by the water. Where did this come from? Wild dogs, came the answer. They have been prowling for three months. They target the goats. Three months ago, there were 16 goats, domesticated and happy. Then one day the dogs arrived. At night, they hop the fence, and kill them and drag them away. Sometimes they ravaged them to the bone right on the spot, and leave the remains to bake in the sun.

Man’s best friend!

The goat herd was down to three. One missing goat made everyone particularly sad. It was undersized, born early, white with brown spots. It was brought close to the house and reared in safety. After several months, it was big enough to care for itself and it was allowed to roam with the others. It only took a day, however. It was the first one targeted in the season’s opening massacre. The baby goat was dinner for dogs.

Such problems as this dominate country life. When it’s not dogs and coyotes and wild cats, it’s other varmints such as raccoons and hyenas, not to mention snakes and scorpions. Flesh-eating birds devour the fish in the pond. Turtles compete for food. Then there is the plant life itself, which is far from innocent to the well being of people. Poison plants and thorny bushes dare us to walk outside areas we have tilled. They choked out new plantings. Then there is the weather itself, which seems to be constantly conspiring to make our lives miserable and foil our plans.

Generally the picture you gain from living in this environment for more than a few days is the very opposite of the ""preservationist"" outlook you get from environmental propaganda. If we are to survive in this cruel world, the only option is to tame it or kill it. It’s them or us. We hear about the precious and delicate balance of nature, how species help each to thrive in a mystical cycle of being, but all we witness is a ""natural"" kill-or-be-killed practice that is so awful you can hardly watch.

The cruel competition for survival is not limited to animals. It extends to plants, to all things. And it could easily characterize the actions of people absent the civilizing institution of exchange, ownership, and the marketplace — the scene of peace in which man uses his reason to create and develop, cooperate and flourish.

And what is war but the very opposite of this impulse, a reversal of reason and an attempt at practicing authentic ""environmentalism"" in which the choice is to kill or be killed?

As I thought of the lessons here, going through my head were the words of a speech delivered by Absalom Weaver in Garet Garrett’s novel Satan’s Bushel, a book of agricultural life with a speech by Weaver that has profound economic and political significance. For in this speech, he compares what is the same and what is different between man and nature. In so doing, he draws attention to aspects of nature that are completely forgotten amid the propaganda.

The setting is a gathering of farmers, who are being lectured by a government bureaucrat at the turn of the 20th century. They are being told to join the federal effort to coordinate wheat sales among themselves, as a means of driving up prices. The problem, as they see it, is that farmers were fighting for their livelihoods in an age of rising industrialization. How can they survive? The bureaucrat offered one way. Weaver offered another:

“This natural elm,” he began, with an admiring look at the tree, “was once a tiny thing. A sheep might have eaten it at one bite. Every living thing around it was hostile and injurious. And it survived. It grew. It took its profit. It became tall and powerful beyond the reach of enemies. What preserved it — cooperative marketing? What gave it power — a law from Congress? What gave it fullness — the Golden Rule? On what was its strength founded — a fraternal spirit? You know better. Your instincts tell you no. It saved itself. It found its own greatness. How? By fighting.

""Did you know that plants fight? If only you could see the deadly, ceaseless warfare among plants this lovely landscape would terrify you. It would make you think man’s struggles tame. I will show you some glimpses of it.

“I hold up this leaf from the elm. The reason it is flat and thin is that the peaceable work of its life is to gather nourishment for the tree from the air. Therefore it must have as much surface as possible to touch the air with. But it has another work to do. A grisly work. A natural work all the same. It must fight.

""For that use it is pointed at the end as you see and has teeth around the edge — these. The first thing the elm plant does is to grow straight up out of the ground with a spear thrust, its leaves rolled tightly together. Its enemies do not notice it. Then suddenly each leaf spreads itself out and with its teeth attacks other plants; it overturns them, holds them out of the sunlight, drowns them. And this is the tree! Do you wonder why the elm plant does not overrun the earth? Because other plants fight back, each in its own way.

""I show you a blade of grass. It has no teeth. How can it fight? Perhaps it lives by love and sweetness. It does not. It grows very fast by stealth, taking up so little room that nothing else minds, until all at once it is tall and strong enough to throw out blades in every direction and fall upon other plants. It smothers them to death. Then the bramble. I care not for the bramble. Not because it fights. For another reason. Here is its weapon. Besides the spear point and the teeth the bramble leaf you see is in five parts, like one’s hand. It is a hand in fact, and one very hard to cast off. When it cannot overthrow and kill an enemy as the elm does, it climbs up his back to light and air, and in fact prefers that opportunity, gaining its profit not in natural combat but in shrewd advantage, like the middleman.

""Another plant I would like to show you. There is one near by. Unfortunately it would be inconvenient to exhibit him in these circumstances. His familiar name is honeysuckle. He is sleek, suave, brilliantly arrayed, and you would not suspect his nature, which is that of the preying speculator. Once you are in his toils it is hopeless. If you have not drowned or smothered him at first he will get you. The way of this plant is to twist itself round and round another and strangle it.

“This awful strife is universal in plant life. There are no exemptions. Among animals it is not so fierce. They can run from one another. Plants must fight it out where they stand. They must live or die on the spot. Among plants of one kind there is rivalry. The weak fall out and die; the better survive. That is the principle of natural selection. But all plants of one kind fight alike against plants of all other kinds. That is the law of their strength. None is helped but who first helps himself. A race of plants that had wasted its time waiting for Congress to give it light and air, or for a state bureau with hired agents to organize it by the Golden Rule, or had been persuaded that its interests were in common with those of the consumer, would have disappeared from the earth.""

Garrett provides this speech as a warning to producers tied to the land: they must be fighters or die. The warning to all of us is that we must understand that nature is only provisionally tamed. In truth, we live in the wild, and we are only a step away from being devoured by it.

370647,"What I call the Weird Factor, for lack of a better name, seems to have become a permanent feature of our post-9/11 world, a dark and sinister leitmotif that plays in the background. On 9/11, of course, the Factor was on full display as a whole string of unusual events and unexplained phenomena were visited on us. The 9/11 Commission did little to clear these matters up, for the most part because they didn’t address them. Just a few for the record: Bush reading My Pet Goat to schoolchildren after being told of the attacks, the sudden appearance of the ""Israeli art students"" — and their buddies, the ""laughing Israelis"" — in the months and weeks leading up to the attacks, and the apparent passivity of US air defenses on that fateful day.

I mean, how is it possible that the terrorists actually hit the Pentagon, the symbolic fortress of America’s alleged military supremacy? After spending untold trillions on ""defense"" over the years, a sum that never declines in real terms, and driving ourselves into near-bankruptcy on account of it, how in the name of all that’s holy did nineteen men armed with box-cutters manage to drive Don Rumsfeld stumbling into the street, literally running for his life?

Reclaiming the America... Justin Raimondo Best Price: $$7.42 Buy New $$12.71 (as of 07:55 EST - Details )

The Weird Factor seems to intensify whenever there is some significant event in our ongoing ""war on terrorism,"" or whatever they’re calling it these days. My longtime readers will be familiar with my theory of how this works. Briefly: on Sept. 11, 2001, the impact of those airliners as they hit the Twin Towers sent us careening into an alternative dimension where up is down, right is left, and torture is the American Way — in short we landed in Bizarro World, where we have been trapped ever since. The post-9/11 cognitive shift that heralded our entry into this alternate dimension is amplified around these incidents, and certainly the most recent — the midair antics of the Undie Bomber — underscores the Weird Factor at its absolute weirdest.

The official narrative has been in flux, due in part to the political firestorm that surrounds the event: President Obama’s characterization of the Undie Bomber as an ""isolated"" individual, unconnected to a larger network, began to fall apart almost before it was uttered. As the links between Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab and the specter of ""al-Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula"" surfaced — along with the incredible story of how Mutallab’s father, a prominent Nigerian banker, personally reported his son to the US embassy and the CIA — the official story had to be amended. Now it’s ""the buck stops here,"" an admission of failure, and the inevitable calls for making everyone’s flying experience more problematic and unendurable than ever.

Also inevitable was the way the Republicans leapt on the incident to somehow prove the President and his party are ""soft"" on terrorism, a strangely empty critique that doesn’t seem to consist of anything more substantial than a highly arguable perception of ""softness"" in the President’s rhetoric. GOPers complained that the President didn’t use the word ""terrorism"" enough, that his tone lacked the requisite harshness, but when it comes to substantial differences over policy — or over the specifics of this case — the Republican critics come up empty. I won’t be the first to point out that the Bush administration’s response to the Richard Reid/Shoe Bomber incident was nearly identical to the Obamaites’ on this very similar occasion. Team Bush raised the threat level, imposed all sorts of new regulations and restrictions to make air travel decidedly more unpleasant, and were somewhat less self-critical than their successors.

In all of this politicized brouhaha, however, we hear not one word about the various anomalies clustered around al-Qaeda’s latest — and most successful — post-9/11 attempt to sow fear and confusion in the West. I count three:

1) The well-dressed ""Indian"" man seen accompanying Mutallab at Amsterdam’s Schnipol airport. Michigan attorney Kurt Haskell, a passenger on the flight, was playing cards with his wife in front of the ticket desk when he saw what he considered to be a bit of an odd couple approach the desk and engage in a conversation with the attendant. Mutallab, who looked to Haskell as if he might be a teenager, was dressed somewhat shabbily, and was accompanied by an older ""well-dressed"" man who looked and sounded like he might be a native of India. When they approached the desk, the Indian did all the talking, explaining that Mutallab didn’t have a passport but needed to get on the flight. The attendant replied that everyone on the flight had to have a passport, to which the Indian retorted that his companion was a Sudanese refugee, and ""we do this all the time."" Well, then you’ll have to speak to my supervisor, said the attendant, and the odd couple went down a hallway: the next time Haskell saw this ""refugee,"" he was setting his underpants on fire in an attempt to down the plane.

I just returned from California, where I attended the first Ancestral Health Symposium in Los Angeles on the UCLA campus, which Dr. Loren Cordain, an early advocate of the Paleolithic diet, has described as “the Woodstock of evolutionary medicine.”

Indeed it was — plenty of minimalist shoes, bare feet, pony tails, shaved heads, colorful clothing, muscle shirts, ripped bodies, anti-state talk, food choice advocacy, fat-fortified beef jerky, and wonderful waist sizes. However, instead of smoking pot and dancing naked, most of us were busy polishing off all of the wonderful, grass-fed food being passed out, for free, by US Wellness Meats. Considering the campus cafeteria and its mostly slop food — aside from the salads, which were overpriced and required a long wait in line — I discovered that I had a choice of either nibbling at the US Wellness beef jerky, pemmican, and grass-fed cheese all day, or settling for a couple of days of involuntary fasting. Actually, I did a little bit of both, and indulged in satisfactory provisions at local restaurants each evening.

Readers not so familiar with this movement will ask: what exactly is ancestral health? The Ancestral Health website describes it this way: ""The Ancestral Health Symposium fosters collaboration among scientists, healthcare professionals and laypersons who study and communicate about health from an evolutionary perspective to develop solutions to our modern health challenges."" The conference speakers and attendees included MDs, scientists, PhDs-to-be, medical school students, health and medical writers, authors, fitness specialists, nonconformist nutritionists, filmmakers, psychologists, bariatric specialists, bloggers, health hobbyists, lifestyle writers, and intelligent laypeople who understand that they don't need a special degree from the education establishment to learn about, and live, the ancestral health lifestyle.

The ancestral health audience is often synonymous with the paleo culture (Paleolithic-type lifestyle/diet); the primal lifestylers as championed by Mark Sisson; the real foodists (natural, whole foods; not industrial-chemical concoctions); and the eco-agricultural lifestylers (such as those who associate with the magnificent Weston A. Price Foundation). I would describe the ancestral health movement as a force for educating people in order to equip them with the intellectual tools that are necessary to deny the conventional wisdom of the special interests and the government-medical corporatocracy so they can become accountable for their own health and life. This movement strives to educate people through science — and so many people do so much hard work for free, and that is because it is a purely grass-roots movement dedicated to spreading knowledge and helping others through voluntary and cooperative efforts. I know, that sounds mighty darn libertarian, doesn't it?

Certainly, libertarians and anarchists are drawn to this lifestyle because of our innate ability to see through the façade of conventional wisdom that is built by political interests and buttressed by an assortment of money trails. We do not deny conventional wisdom for the sake of being anti-mainstream, as some people opine; rather, we naturally tend toward the procurement of skepticism, critical thinking, and other skills that the rank and file just do not seem to possess. For instance, the average person reads a headline such as, ""Fat makes you fat,"" and they will believe that it must be true because it was based on some ""official"" study that is misrepresented in the story. Conversely, we libertarians tend to say, hey, wait a minute — how was the study interpreted by the media, who performed/funded the study, and how scientific was the study? Mark Sisson, perhaps the most visible person within the ancestral health community, calls this taking responsibility for your ""own health and enjoyment of life by investigating, discussing, and critically rethinking everything we've assumed to be true about health and wellness.""

I recall the days on the old libertarian listservs and email lists where libertarians eagerly debated Dr. Atkins and his high-fat, low-carb ideas and supported his fight against the medical-nutritional oligarchy. The interest in Atkins led libertarians to study and comprehend the faulty research of Ancel Keys and the government-endorsed lipid hypothesis, as well as the role of the government in setting dietary guidelines that would benefit Big Agra, Big Pharma, and the industrial food machine. My personal interest in Atkins, that commenced in the 1990s, led me to write a lot of non-byline, website content for Atkins Nutritionals as a freelance writer. This happened when an editor for Atkins was looking for a writer to work Thanksgiving weekend and clean up some poorly written copy that was lacking some bolstering facts. She found me through a Google search, liked my acerbic writing approach, and contacted me about taking on the work. We hooked up, and about two years of paid work was the outcome.

I'll get back to the culture and content of the symposium. In fact, I'll start with a few cynical observations that I must let rip. What stands out, for me, is that there were some painfully predictable patterns in this 2-day PaleoLand — well, at least they were predicted by me  especially the bare feet and the Vibrams shoes and the cross-fit guys in muscle gear and weightlifting shoes. It sort of reminded me of my Harley-Davidson homies who all dress alike, in black vests, patches, and black everything, in order to be ""different"" from all the others. Kind of makes my eyes roll. Undoubtedly, some of the me-too fashion was a bit daft, but then again, who am I to diss these right-thinking, health-conscious, kindred spirits who were there because they are more astute than 98% of their fellow human beings? After all, we were all there because we are unorthodox in one form or another. Weird, crazy, and frenzied come to mind. To be sure, ""no shoes, no shirt"" would not have been a problem at this conference. In fact, most of this crowd, unlike the general masses, would not have scared anyone away in a no-shirt mode. Lots of beautiful people, as you would expect. Remarkably, there were whole rooms of people with shoulders wider than their waists. So, the occasional uniformity gets a pass here — with a smile.

One thing that was missing from many of the speakers and informal conversations, that I noticed, was spirited discussion of the root of the problem for our obese, sick, unhealthy society: omnipotent government and its creation and perpetuation of the medical-pharmaceutical-nutritional-corporate state complex that makes people sick and keeps them sick for the sake of market share and continuing profits. I think this is because the paleo movement, overall, tends to operate in a very narrow silo. Many of the paleos, for whatever reason, deny or just don't pay attention to the fact that, yes, there is a force, an invincible monster — the state  that uses its monopolistic power to influence science and force its health and nutritional policy upon the masses in order to benefit the rent-seeking special interests that make up the core of the medical-nutritional establishment. These state-empowered interests benefit from cancer, chronic disease, and obesity, yet oftentimes the folks in PaleoLand naïvely act as if it is a mystery as to how the Conventional Wisdomists have become so formidable. Only an entity with a monopoly on coercion — the state — can possibly create so much misinformation and fraudulent advice, backed by enforced policy, on such a massive scale. Yet, thanks to the Internet and social media, the ancestral health enthusiasts are starting to bring the state's monopoly on information to its knees.

Now remember that many of the folks who spoke at the symposium are hardcore libertarians, anarchists, or either that, it's very obvious to me that they tend toward libertarianism: Dr. Michael Eades, blogger Richard Nikoley, author Gary Taubes, Fathead filmmaker Tom Naughton, Don Matesz, Mark Sisson, John Durant, Denise Minger, and many others.

Interestingly, I was approached by many libertarians who introduced themselves to me, telling me that they had been reading my work, either on my website or on LewRockwell.com. Several folks told me that it was my writings on paleo-primal lifestyling, food freedom, and the medical establishment that got them absorbed in the topic and led them to their newly-acquired healthy living choices. So no, not everything in the libertarian world can be couched in terms of ""speaking to the choir,"" as people tend to pontificate.

Unlike most of the symposium attendees, I sit in this odd space where I span different movements, or spheres: (1) libertarianism and Austrian Economics (or anarcho-capitalism) (2) eco-agricultural interests and anti-state food freedom, as well as the (3) primal-paleo or ancestral health movement. All three are areas of interest to me, and all are indispensable in the battle to establish self-ownership and keep the state out of our bodies and out of our kitchens. As much as the paloes are inherently libertarian-ish, it is my hope that more of the ancestral health proponents will learn from libertarianism as it applies to understanding the state as a monopolistic entity so they can better grasp how the state uses its power and propaganda to feloniously indoctrinate the masses and hammer home its totalitarian agenda.

Comedian and filmmaker Tom Naughton gave the most stellar presentation of the symposium. Being the perpetual comedian, he likes to make fun of himself, but in reality, it's hard to beat that guy's combination of intelligence, passion, humor, and creativity. Even his voice and narration is marvelous. Here is a version of Tom's presentation, ""Science for Smart People,"" on YouTube, which was presented on Jimmy Moore's Low-Carb Cruise earlier this year. I thought that Naughton's presentation clearly pointed to the medical establishment and the kept media as being indebted toward special interests, and thereby intentionally spinning science to benefit the domain of conventional wisdom.

Scientific giants who were present included Dr. Robert Lustig, MD, a prominent scientist known for his work on fructose and sugar, and Dr. Richard Feinman, PhD, from the Nutrition and Metabolism Society. Although Dr. Feinman and I had a tit-for-tat on Jimmy Moore's Facebook page (about my article on Dr. Lustig) prior to the event, I had an opportunity to talk to him about Lustig and some of his disagreements with Lustig's positions. I found Dr. Feinman to be very brilliant, engaging, and sweet. He and Lustig, who appear to be friendly colleagues with much in common, attracted a lot of attention when the two stepped outside to discuss their contradictory ideas. Enquiring minds wanted to know what they were saying to one another.

Also presenting at the symposium was low-carb veteran Dr. Michael Eades, MD, who, along with his wife Mary, also an MD, has written a slew of books on the health, nutrition, exercise, and low-carb living. Dr. Eades, like most of the ancestral health community, also blogs and tweets, and being about mid-sixties or so, he looked like a movie star. Clearly, low-carb has been kind to him. I was fortunate enough to spend some time talking to him, and I found out that he has his roots and family in Detroit, my hometown.

The Primal Blueprint: ... Mark Sisson Best Price: $$1.32 Buy New $$5.77 (as of 08:40 EST - Details)

I also met Mark Sisson of Marksdailyapple.com for the first time, after many correspondences. Mark is an author, blogger, and all-around evangelist for good living, and his topic was “Play: A Lost Art,” which is an area where he has established an unquestionable expertise. It was the only talk where smacking beach balls around the audience was not only allowed, it was required that everyone touch a ball at least once. I reviewed Mark’s book, Primal Blueprint, a pioneering work on ancestral health, last year on LewRockwell.com. The buff and blond Mark is so debonair, and he was very approachable for so many of the attendees who hoped to get a glimpse of the guy who helped them reshape their lives through a new health paradigm. Mark’s business manager, who I also spoke with, told me the web stats for Marksdailyapple.com, and it left me with a “Wow.” Fortunately, the unconventional media continues to steer attention away from received opinion and toward critical evaluation of science and the established media mechanism.

My ""biggest surprise"" award for the symposium goes to Nora Gedgaudas, author of Primal Mind, Primal Body: Beyond the Paleo Diet for Total Health and a Longer Life. I admit I had not paid enough attention to her in the past. I had not read the first edition of her book, and I am glad I never got around to it because she recently joined with Healing Arts Press to release a new edition this year. I've been looking through the book — and I'll read it in total — and it is splendid and solid, including the striking cover. It's a no-B.S. book on evolutionary science that speaks to really basic concepts in a straightforward manner. Everything that should be in the book is in the book. I've always advocated and recommended Mark Sisson's Primal Blueprint as the quintessential read for ancestral health newbies, but Nora's book is so readable and polished that it may go right up there with Mark's epic work. I also got to meet and talk with Paul Jaminet and his wife Shou-Ching, authors of Perfect Health Diet: Four Steps to Renewed Health, Youthful Vitality, and Long Life, which is another innovative work that is perfect for new students of ancestral health. Both of these books come highly recommended from all folks around the paleosphere.

The ""biggest badass"" award, for the entire symposium, goes to Dr. Jack Kruse, a neurosurgeon, who was not even a speaker at the event. I lay my bet right now that he will be a speaker next year, and he will pack the room to the gills. If you talk about smart as a whip, articulate, and passionate, you are talking about this very libertarian-ish Doc. Dr. Jack even gave me a slight spanking  very slight  for calling out Dr. Lustig on his call for state intervention to conduct a war on sugar, because he believes that we need Dr. Lustig's knowledge and audience, and that we can educate him and ""bring him on over to our side"" on the issue of intervention. That sounds like a worthy project.

I met Dr. Jack when, during the last presentation of the last day, some of the speakers on a panel, “Integrating Ancestral Health Into Our Healthcare Systems,” proposed that we work from within the system to change the system. The speakers proposed that we could work with the Kaiser Permanente or VA models of health care to create this glorious, new model for health care based on an ancestral health model. My blood pressure was skyrocketing in the back of the room, almost causing my head to burst open. Before I could pipe up on the topic and speak my mind, Dr. Jack did so, and he spoke for all of us health anarchists and libertarians when he said the naked truth in one short sentence (to paraphrase): “The system wants to keep you sick because everyone makes money from you being sick.” Shockingly, many people in the room furled their eyebrows at that comment and seemed confused. I deliberately watched the reactions in the audience knowing that people would think Jack's statement to be a bit outrageous. This was another indicator, for me, that the paleo and/or ancestral health movement is, in part, operating in a silo.

A circle of folks gathered at the back of the room as the presentation ended and an impassioned Dr. Jack stole the floor and ran with it. It started when I introduced myself to him and we started discussing u2018the system.' Folks listened and just started gathering around this fetching bloke. He argued and lectured and taught — with a mix of intellect and well-placed f-bombs  for this group of onlookers who gathered in a Socratic circle, of sorts. It was a great display of passion and knowledge from a guy who has worked within the medical establishment-healthcare system, and who now works outside of that monster. He blogged about that informal session here, and he writes:

The last talk I went to……was Brent Pottenger's et al. And while I never expected it to raise my BP and ire…….WOW did it. It may have been the quickest talk but most important. The point of the talk was how can we bridge the gap of evolutionary biology and our current healthcare system. Brent and Joe Sobolewski think Kaiser's or the VA's model may hold the answer. This surgeon could not disagree more vehemently. I think all those who heard me speak post meeting know where I stand. Seth Roberts, Karen DeCoster and Jolly all saw it…….and Jolly photographed the jugulars bulging from my neck. I definitely think Brent's idea to make a Paleo ACO or insurance pool is a great idea…….but how we implement it is another story for another day. Those young bucks who have just begun to play in the healthcare cesspool system we have have much to learn. I bet Brent changes the most as he enter's medical school in 5 days. When he comes out of an orthopedic residency I already know what he can not fathom yet……..Kaiser is the last place on earth he would ever practice orthopedics when he knows what this surgeon knows today. Paleo needs a system that is completely free of the hospital complex in my view. This maybe a place I take my blog now……not sure my health could handle it though.

As one who is employed in the system Dr. Jack talks about, I have nothing but praise and agreement for the good doctor's excellent comments and libertarian take on the solution: we can only change the system by denying the establishment's conventional wisdom, creating our own paradigm, and working outside of the system, making the system irrelevant. Whether or not he is an anarchist, Dr. Kruse is my new anarcho-ancestral hero.

I also want to give special mention to Dr. Doug McGuff, whose talk titled ""Body by Science,"" was notable for its mention of cross-fit as a less-than-ideal form of fitness. Doug is an old-fashioned weightlifter who stresses high-intensity (HIT), low-frequency training and recommends that one avoid aerobic-centric training. I do both HIT and my own “cross-fit” type workouts, however, my cross-fit work is of the solo brand and not the club-based, group-collective type that crossfitters practice at a very fast pace in a WOD (workout of the day) format.

I don't mean to diss the crossfitters, but timed workouts at specific times on specific days, with a group of people against whom you compete (as well as the ticking clock), is not my idea of primal, self-governed fitness. I don't count times, laps, calories, sets, reps, weight, days, or clock time, and I'm a far better — and more fit — person for having given up all of the routines and performance measurement. I believe I have far better measurements such as how I feel all day each day, my physical conditioning level as played out in my activities, my medical feedback — both the objective measurements and my holistic MD's assessment, and lastly, the naked view in the mirror. All of those evaluations tell me what I need to know about my state of health and quality of life.

Overall, the symposium was a smashing success, but there are a couple of minor improvements I'd like to see for next year. For one, I'd like to see the symposium held in a larger space so there could be many more vendors that would set up tables, hand out stuff, and mingle with potential consumers for their products and/or ideas. There were very few vendors, and I thought that was disappointing. Additionally, there needs to be a talk or two on the state and its role in creating and maintaining the Unhealthy Society, as I wrote above.

Another notable mention about the ancestral health community is its masterful use of social media. Libertarians, as much as they tend to run wild on the web in brilliant fashion, can learn something from this community when it comes to using social media. The ancestral health community is so good at using Twitter as a timesaving intelligence tool that transmits relevant data right to your phone, right now, when the story, blog, or research link is fresh and relevant. Twitter is a tool that circumvents the gatekeepers of conventional wisdom and keeps the facts and truth circulating in spite of what the media and establishment want you to know. Twitter represents freedom, in spite of the attempts of the police state to corral it, under the facade of protecting us all from society's multifarious boogeymen. Blogger Jimmy Moore, of Livin' La Vida Low-Carb fame, told me he thought he was acting less than primal by Twittering away the whole conference from his iPad. He said it gave him a headache! But people like Jimmy are the peaceful soldiers of the information revolution, restoring facts and freedom one Tweet at a time.

It is because of the blogging community, Facebook, and Twitter that this landmark conference was able to take place, and in a manner that was beneficial for both the scientific community and interested laymen. In an age where obesity and chronic disease has become so commonplace within one generation, folks are desperate to be freed from these abnormalities and live a thriving life in a thin and healthy body that embraces the natural human state of wellness. I can only hope this symposium is the onset of something so monumental and so accessible that the government and its gatekeepers are powerless to stop it.

217010,"I have decided to become a drunk and live under a bench, maybe in a radiation suit. It only makes sense. The times are dire. Dark shapes twist in the international fog. The US, in the hands of puzzled children of low moral character, flaps about like a damp rag in a high wind. Anything could happen.

I figure to enjoy it since I can’t stop it. It would all seem more amusing and less dark, I thought, if I weren’t immoderately sober. To this end I walked to the Oxxo, which is a Mexican Seven-Eleven, and bought a bottle of Padre Kino red.

Maybe I should have bought two bottles.

There is much to cause worry. The strange little man in the White House is leering at Iran in his customary state of martial priapism. Not good. (Wild thought: Someone ought to give Iran nuclear weapons, so he won’t attack it.) Anyway, wee Bush, not having enough army for his current wars, wants to start a bigger and shinier one.

Somebody explain it to me. I have limited geostrategic grasp. Perhaps he believes that by spreading unwinnability over several wars, he will reduce it in each. Victory through distributed defeat.

I keep reading that Herr Bush may use “bunker buster” nukes in Iran. To the inordinately dim, this has a comforting sound. You know, a little itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny, perhaps yellow polka-dot nukelet goes way down in the earth and, fooomp! blows up the evil bunker, hardly rattling the windows above. Actually an earth-penetrator doesn’t penetrate beyond a few feet, all of which turn into fallout.

The Padre Kino isn’t working. None of this makes any sense, even after half a bottle. I may have to go IV. The president’s virtuous plan to spread democracy like bird flu goes apace. Ain’t nobody heah ceptin’ us missionaries. The rascal is imposing democracy right and left, though mostly left as it turns out.

It is working. Well, it is having an effect. In Venezuela democracy brought about Hugo Chavez, who hates the United States. In Bolivia it produced Evo Morales, who hates the United States. In Iran it empowered Ahmawhatsispelling, who hates the United States. So does the elected government in Iraq. In Palestine Mr. Bush’s righteousness elected Hamas, which hates the United States, perhaps as much as does the Muslim Brotherhood, which keeps getting more elected in Egypt.

There’s nothing like democracy, I say. There’s nothing like brains either, but they seem to be in short supply. I mean, if you force elections in countries where everybody hates you, after doing things that make sure that everyone hates you…?

I think I’ll call Oxxo and tell them to put another bottle on hold. Maybe they have a layaway plan.

See, this whole mess is a splendid contest between a Titan and a pygmy, the pygmy being very well armed and the Titan being very smart. High drama and all. Made for television. The pygmy used New York as a pretext to conquer the Middle East and get the oil. Bin Laden used New York to sucker the pygmy into a losing war that would leave the United States defanged and broken. One of them has guessed wrong. We’ll know which before long.

I still don’t get it. Maybe psilocybin would help. It doesn’t make you understand anything, but makes everything else equally confusing so that nothing stands out. These days, it’s the best you can hope for.

What jolly things are the rest of the presidential children doing? The vice president has shot someone while duck hunting, and apparently while drunk. Only wounded him, though. I grew up in a country where fifteen-year-old boys regularly hunted. Nobody ever shot anybody. I am not sure that a clown who cannot be trusted with hunting arms really ought to exert influence over intercontinental missiles. The only consolation is that he would be likely to miss.

Next I see that Mr. Rumsfeld, the secretary of alleged defense, has said “We’ve got Chavez in Venezuela with a lot of oil money. He’s a person who was elected legally, just as Adolf Hitler was elected legally, and then consolidated power, and now is, of course, working closely with Fidel Castro and Mr. Morales and others. It concerns me.""

Mr. Rumsfeld concerns me. The assertion that Hitler is working with Castro and Evo Morales does have its appeal. It implies that Adolf really did take an immortality drug and move to Argentina. Is this something NSA hasn’t told us? Maybe Mr. Rumsfeld wasn’t paying attention during grade-school English classes. Hitler of course was never elected legally but appointed Chancellor by Hindenburg in 1933, never having gotten more than 37% of the vote. I knew this in high school. Why doesn’t the Secretary of Defense? Reassuring, that. Pig ignorant and pugnacious.

I note that Mr. Bush was elected legally, unless of course he wasn’t, and consolidates power. Fast. I do not think that he will work with Castro and Morales, though. He couldn’t remember them long enough.

And of course there is Kind Of Leezer Rice, the Secretary of State. Being non-male and non-white, she is slightly more sacred than God, if only in that she is allowed on federal property.

She is said to “speak Russian fluently.” Is there any evidence that she speaks it at all? Where are the publications to document her purportedly coruscating intelligence? Bookfinder.com produces only The Soviet Union & the Czechoslovak Army 1948-1983, noted for its poor grasp of historical fact.

I asked an academic friend about this, and he responded, “I checked a couple of computer databases for scholarly articles by Dr. Rice and couldn’t find any. My suspicions were further aroused by the fact that of all the adoring articles I found about Dr. Rice (including her official curriculum vitae on the White House web site), none listed any scholarly publications apart from the aforementioned book.” Oh.

The world is reeling slightly. Doubtless a gravitational anomaly. What if Bush doesn’t leave when his term ends? He would say he had to remain to protect us from terror. The nation abounds in fools, as Australia does in rabbits. Who would do anything about a coup—or, pardon me, “emergency measure”? And what?

Who’s in charge of this choo-choo train? A witless draft-dodger, an inept duck-hunter, an historical illiterate, and an overrated twofer. I’m going to hide.

The great fallacy of childhood is the belief that grownups must know what they are doing. There is no evidence for this in the historical record. You would do better by grabbing a government at random from the denizens of a rural high school. Democracy brings us twerps, psychopaths, ambitious ciphers, short men, and well-born drones. They are what they are. They can’t change any more than a leper can change his spots. I need some really strong drugs or someone to hit me on the head with a rubber mallet. Opium is the religion of the masses. Let us pray.

by Ron Paul by Ron Paul

Before the US House of Representatives, February 16, 2006

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this very dangerous legislation. My colleagues would do well to understand that this legislation is leading us toward war against Iran.

Those reading this bill may find themselves feeling a sense of dj vu. In many cases one can just substitute “Iraq” for “Iran” in this bill and we could be back in the pre-2003 run up to war with Iraq. And the logic of this current push for war is much the same as was the logic used in the argument for war on Iraq. As earlier with Iraq, this resolution demands that Iran perform the impossible task of proving a negative — in this case that Iran does not have plans to build a nuclear weapon.

There are a few things we need to remember when thinking about Iran and this legislation. First, Iran has never been ruled in violation of its international nuclear non-proliferation obligations.

Second, Iran concluded a Safeguards Agreement more than 30 years ago that provides for the verification of Iran’s fulfillment of its obligation to not divert nuclear energy programs to nuclear weapons development. Since this agreement was reached, the International Atomic Energy Agency has never found any indication that Iran has diverted or attempted to divert source or special nuclear materials from a peaceful purpose to a military purpose. But, this does not stop those eager for conflict with Iran from stating otherwise. As the Washington Post reported last year, “U.S. officials, eager to move the Iran issue to the U.N. Security Council — which has the authority to impose sanctions — have begun a new round of briefings for allies designed to convince them that Iran’s real intention is to use its energy program as a cover for bomb building. The briefings will focus on the White House’s belief that a country with as much oil as Iran would not need an energy program on the scale it is planning, according to two officials.”

This reminds us of the quick move to justify the invasion of Iraq by citing Iraq’s “intentions” when actual weapons of mass destruction could not be found.

The resolution’s second resolved clause is a real misrepresentation of the Iran/EU3 talks. The “efforts of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom” were not “to seek…suspension of enrichment and reprocessing related activities…” As the EU3-Iran Paris Agreement makes very clear, the suspension of enrichment is a purely voluntary measure taken by Iran and is “not a legal obligation.” This is similar to the situation with Iran’s voluntarily observation of the Additional Protocols (allowing unannounced inspections) without legally being bound to do so. Suspending voluntary observance of the Additional Protocols is not a violation of the NPT. But, those seeking to push us toward war with Iran are purposely trying to connect the two — to confuse voluntary “confidence building” measures taken by Iran with the legally-binding Treaty itself.

Resolved clause four of this legislation is the most inflammatory and objectionable part of the legislation. It lowers the bar to initiating war on Iran. This clause anticipates that the US may not be successful in getting the Security Council to pass a Resolution because of the potential of a Russian or Chinese veto, so it “calls upon” Russia and China to “take action” in response to “any report” of “Iran’s noncompliance. That is right: any report. Mr. Speaker, this resolution is a drumbeat for war with Iran. Its logic is faulty, its premises are flawed, and its conclusions are dangerous. I urge my colleagues to stop for a moment and ponder the wisdom of starting yet another war in the Middle East.

467882,"What the Price of Gold Is Telling Us

by Ron Paul by Ron Paul

Watch Ron Paul’s speech on video.

Before the U.S. House of Representatives, April 25, 2006

The financial press, and even the network news shows, have begun reporting the price of gold regularly. For twenty years, between 1980 and 2000, the price of gold was rarely mentioned. There was little interest, and the price was either falling or remaining steady.

Since 2001 however, interest in gold has soared along with its price. With the price now over $$600 an ounce, a lot more people are becoming interested in gold as an investment and an economic indicator. Much can be learned by understanding what the rising dollar price of gold means.

The rise in gold prices from $$250 per ounce in 2001 to over $$600 today has drawn investors and speculators into the precious metals market. Though many already have made handsome profits, buying gold per se should not be touted as a good investment. After all, gold earns no interest and its quality never changes. It’s static, and does not grow as sound investments should.

It’s more accurate to say that one might invest in a gold or silver mining company, where management, labor costs, and the nature of new discoveries all play a vital role in determining the quality of the investment and the profits made.

Buying gold and holding it is somewhat analogous to converting one’s savings into one hundred dollar bills and hiding them under the mattress — yet not exactly the same. Both gold and dollars are considered money, and holding money does not qualify as an investment. There’s a big difference between the two however, since by holding paper money one loses purchasing power. The purchasing power of commodity money, e.g., gold, however, goes up if the government devalues the circulating fiat currency.

Holding gold is protection or insurance against government’s proclivity to debase its currency. The purchasing power of gold goes up not because it’s a so-called good investment; it goes up in value only because the paper currency goes down in value. In our current situation, that means the dollar.

One of the characteristics of commodity money — one that originated naturally in the marketplace — is that it must serve as a store of value. Gold and silver meet that test — paper does not. Because of this profound difference, the incentive and wisdom of holding emergency funds in the form of gold becomes attractive when the official currency is being devalued. It’s more attractive than trying to save wealth in the form of a fiat currency, even when earning some nominal interest. The lack of earned interest on gold is not a problem once people realize the purchasing power of their currency is declining faster than the interest rates they might earn. The purchasing power of gold can rise even faster than increases in the cost of living.

The point is that most who buy gold do so to protect against a depreciating currency rather than as an investment in the classical sense. Americans understand this less than citizens of other countries; some nations have suffered from severe monetary inflation that literally led to the destruction of their national currency. Though our inflation — i.e., the depreciation of the U.S. dollar — has been insidious, average Americans are unaware of how this occurs. For instance, few Americans know nor seem concerned that the 1913 pre-Federal Reserve dollar is now worth only four cents. Officially, our central bankers and our politicians express no fear that the course on which we are set is fraught with great danger to our economy and our political system. The belief that money created out of thin air can work economic miracles, if only properly managed, is pervasive in D.C.

In many ways we shouldn’t be surprised about this trust in such an unsound system. For at least four generations our government-run universities have systematically preached a monetary doctrine justifying the so-called wisdom of paper money over the foolishness of sound money. Not only that, paper money has worked surprisingly well in the past 35 years — the years the world has accepted pure paper money as currency. Alan Greenspan bragged that central bankers in these several decades have gained the knowledge necessary to make paper money respond as if it were gold. This removes the problem of obtaining gold to back currency, and hence frees politicians from the rigid discipline a gold standard imposes.

Many central bankers in the last 15 years became so confident they had achieved this milestone that they sold off large hoards of their gold reserves. At other times they tried to prove that paper works better than gold by artificially propping up the dollar by suppressing market gold prices. This recent deception failed just as it did in the 1960s, when our government tried to hold gold artificially low at $$35 an ounce. But since they could not truly repeal the economic laws regarding money, just as many central bankers sold, others bought. It’s fascinating that the European central banks sold gold while Asian central banks bought it over the last several years.

Since gold has proven to be the real money of the ages, we see once again a shift in wealth from the West to the East, just as we saw a loss of our industrial base in the same direction. Though Treasury officials deny any U.S. sales or loans of our official gold holdings, no audits are permitted so no one can be certain.

The special nature of the dollar as the reserve currency of the world has allowed this game to last longer than it would have otherwise. But the fact that gold has gone from $$252 per ounce to over $$600 means there is concern about the future of the dollar. The higher the price for gold, the greater the concern for the dollar. Instead of dwelling on the dollar price of gold, we should be talking about the depreciation of the dollar. In 1934 a dollar was worth 1/20th of an ounce of gold; $$20 bought an ounce of gold. Today a dollar is worth 1/600th of an ounce of gold, meaning it takes $$600 to buy one ounce of gold.

The number of dollars created by the Federal Reserve, and through the fractional reserve banking system, is crucial in determining how the market assesses the relationship of the dollar and gold. Though there’s a strong correlation, it’s not instantaneous or perfectly predictable. There are many variables to consider, but in the long term the dollar price of gold represents past inflation of the money supply. Equally important, it represents the anticipation of how much new money will be created in the future. This introduces the factor of trust and confidence in our monetary authorities and our politicians. And these days the American people are casting a vote of no confidence in this regard, and for good reasons.

The incentive for central bankers to create new money out of thin air is twofold. One is to practice central economic planning through the manipulation of interest rates. The second is to monetize the escalating federal debt politicians create and thrive on.

Today no one in Washington believes for a minute that runaway deficits are going to be curtailed. In March alone, the federal government created an historic $$85 billion deficit. The current supplemental bill going through Congress has grown from $$92 billion to over $$106 billion, and everyone knows it will not draw President Bush’s first veto. Most knowledgeable people therefore assume that inflation of the money supply is not only going to continue, but accelerate. This anticipation, plus the fact that many new dollars have been created over the past 15 years that have not yet been fully discounted, guarantees the further depreciation of the dollar in terms of gold.

There’s no single measurement that reveals what the Fed has done in the recent past or tells us exactly what it’s about to do in the future. Forget about the lip service given to transparency by new Fed Chairman Bernanke. Not only is this administration one of the most secretive across the board in our history, the current Fed firmly supports denying the most important measurement of current monetary policy to Congress, the financial community, and the American public. Because of a lack of interest and poor understanding of monetary policy, Congress has expressed essentially no concern about the significant change in reporting statistics on the money supply.

Beginning in March, though planned before Bernanke arrived at the Fed, the central bank discontinued compiling and reporting the monetary aggregate known as M3. M3 is the best description of how quickly the Fed is creating new money and credit. Common sense tells us that a government central bank creating new money out of thin air depreciates the value of each dollar in circulation. Yet this report is no longer available to us and Congress makes no demands to receive it.

Though M3 is the most helpful statistic to track Fed activity, it by no means tells us everything we need to know about trends in monetary policy. Total bank credit, still available to us, gives us indirect information reflecting the Fed’s inflationary policies. But ultimately the markets will figure out exactly what the Fed is up to, and then individuals, financial institutions, governments, and other central bankers will act accordingly. The fact that our money supply is rising significantly cannot be hidden from the markets.

The response in time will drive the dollar down, while driving interest rates and commodity prices up. Already we see this trend developing, which surely will accelerate in the not too distant future. Part of this reaction will be from those who seek a haven to protect their wealth — not invest — by treating gold and silver as universal and historic money. This means holding fewer dollars that are decreasing in value while holding gold as it increases in value.

A soaring gold price is a vote of no confidence in the central bank and the dollar. This certainly was the case in 1979 and 1980. Today, gold prices reflect a growing restlessness with the increasing money supply, our budgetary and trade deficits, our unfunded liabilities, and the inability of Congress and the administration to reign in runaway spending.

Denying us statistical information, manipulating interest rates, and artificially trying to keep gold prices in check won’t help in the long run. If the markets are fooled short term, it only means the adjustments will be much more dramatic later on. And in the meantime, other market imbalances develop.

The Fed tries to keep the consumer spending spree going, not through hard work and savings, but by creating artificial wealth in stock markets bubbles and housing bubbles. When these distortions run their course and are discovered, the corrections will be quite painful.

Likewise, a fiat monetary system encourages speculation and unsound borrowing. As problems develop, scapegoats are sought and frequently found in foreign nations. This prompts many to demand altering exchange rates and protectionist measures. The sentiment for this type of solution is growing each day.

Though everyone decries inflation, trade imbalances, economic downturns, and federal deficits, few attempt a closer study of our monetary system and how these events are interrelated. Even if it were recognized that a gold standard without monetary inflation would be advantageous, few in Washington would accept the political disadvantages of living with the discipline of gold — since it serves as a check on government size and power. This is a sad commentary on the politics of today. The best analogy to our affinity for government spending, borrowing, and inflating is that of a drug addict who knows if he doesn’t quit he’ll die; yet he can’t quit because of the heavy price required to overcome the dependency. The right choice is very difficult, but remaining addicted to drugs guarantees the death of the patient, while our addiction to deficit spending, debt, and inflation guarantees the collapse of our economy.

Special interest groups, who vigorously compete for federal dollars, want to perpetuate the system rather than admit to a dangerous addiction. Those who champion welfare for the poor, entitlements for the middle class, or war contracts for the military industrial corporations, all agree on the so-called benefits bestowed by the Fed’s power to counterfeit fiat money. Bankers, who benefit from our fractional reserve system, likewise never criticize the Fed, especially since it’s the lender of last resort that bails out financial institutions when crises arise. And it’s true, special interests and bankers do benefit from the Fed, and may well get bailed out — just as we saw with the Long-Term Capital Management fund crisis a few years ago. In the past, companies like Lockheed and Chrysler benefited as well. But what the Fed cannot do is guarantee the market will maintain trust in the worthiness of the dollar. Current policy guarantees that the integrity of the dollar will be undermined. Exactly when this will occur, and the extent of the resulting damage to financial system, cannot be known for sure — but it is coming. There are plenty of indications already on the horizon.

Foreign policy plays a significant role in the economy and the value of the dollar. A foreign policy of militarism and empire building cannot be supported through direct taxation. The American people would never tolerate the taxes required to pay immediately for overseas wars, under the discipline of a gold standard. Borrowing and creating new money is much more politically palatable. It hides and delays the real costs of war, and the people are lulled into complacency — especially since the wars we fight are couched in terms of patriotism, spreading the ideas of freedom, and stamping out terrorism. Unnecessary wars and fiat currencies go hand-in-hand, while a gold standard encourages a sensible foreign policy.

The cost of war is enormously detrimental; it significantly contributes to the economic instability of the nation by boosting spending, deficits, and inflation. Funds used for war are funds that could have remained in the productive economy to raise the standard of living of Americans now unemployed, underemployed, or barely living on the margin.

Yet even these costs may be preferable to paying for war with huge tax increases. This is because although fiat dollars are theoretically worthless, value is imbued by the trust placed in them by the world’s financial community. Subjective trust in a currency can override objective knowledge about government policies, but only for a limited time.

Economic strength and military power contribute to the trust in a currency; in today’s world trust in the U.S. dollar is not earned and therefore fragile. The history of the dollar, being as good as gold up until 1971, is helpful in maintaining an artificially higher value for the dollar than deserved.

Foreign policy contributes to the crisis when the spending to maintain our worldwide military commitments becomes prohibitive, and inflationary pressures accelerate. But the real crisis hits when the world realizes the king has no clothes, in that the dollar has no backing, and we face a military setback even greater than we already are experiencing in Iraq. Our token friends may quickly transform into vocal enemies once the attack on the dollar begins.

False trust placed in the dollar once was helpful to us, but panic and rejection of the dollar will develop into a real financial crisis. Then we will have no other option but to tighten our belts, go back to work, stop borrowing, start saving, and rebuild our industrial base, while adjusting to a lower standard of living for most Americans.

Counterfeiting the nation’s money is a serious offense. The founders were especially adamant about avoiding the chaos, inflation, and destruction associated with the Continental dollar. That’s why the Constitution is clear that only gold and silver should be legal tender in the United States. In 1792 the Coinage Act authorized the death penalty for any private citizen who counterfeited the currency. Too bad they weren’t explicit that counterfeiting by government officials is just as detrimental to the economy and the value of the dollar.

In wartime, many nations actually operated counterfeiting programs to undermine our dollar, but never to a disastrous level. The enemy knew how harmful excessive creation of new money could be to the dollar and our economy. But it seems we never learned the dangers of creating new money out of thin air. We don’t need an Arab nation or the Chinese to undermine our system with a counterfeiting operation. We do it ourselves, with all the disadvantages that would occur if others did it to us. Today we hear threats from some Arab, Muslim, and far Eastern countries about undermining the dollar system — not by dishonest counterfeiting, but by initiating an alternative monetary system based on gold. Wouldn’t that be ironic? Such an event theoretically could do great harm to us. This day may well come, not so much as a direct political attack on the dollar system but out of necessity to restore confidence in money once again.

Historically, paper money never has lasted for long periods of time, while gold has survived thousands of years of attacks by political interests and big government. In time, the world once again will restore trust in the monetary system by making some currency as good as gold.

Gold, or any acceptable market commodity money, is required to preserve liberty. Monopoly control by government of a system that creates fiat money out of thin air guarantees the loss of liberty. No matter how well-intended our militarism is portrayed, or how happily the promises of wonderful programs for the poor are promoted, inflating the money supply to pay these bills makes government bigger. Empires always fail, and expenses always exceed projections. Harmful unintended consequences are the rule, not the exception. Welfare for the poor is inefficient and wasteful. The beneficiaries are rarely the poor themselves, but instead the politicians, bureaucrats, or the wealthy. The same is true of all foreign aid — it’s nothing more than a program that steals from the poor in a rich country and gives to the rich leaders of a poor country. Whether it’s war or welfare payments, it always means higher taxes, inflation, and debt. Whether it’s the extraction of wealth from the productive economy, the distortion of the market by interest rate manipulation, or spending for war and welfare, it can’t happen without infringing upon personal liberty.

At home the war on poverty, terrorism, drugs, or foreign rulers provides an opportunity for authoritarians to rise to power, individuals who think nothing of violating the people’s rights to privacy and freedom of speech. They believe their role is to protect the secrecy of government, rather than protect the privacy of citizens. Unfortunately, that is the atmosphere under which we live today, with essentially no respect for the Bill of Rights.

Though great economic harm comes from a government monopoly fiat monetary system, the loss of liberty associated with it is equally troubling. Just as empires are self-limiting in terms of money and manpower, so too is a monetary system based on illusion and fraud. When the end comes we will be given an opportunity to choose once again between honest money and liberty on one hand; chaos, poverty, and authoritarianism on the other.

The economic harm done by a fiat monetary system is pervasive, dangerous, and unfair. Though runaway inflation is injurious to almost everyone, it is more insidious for certain groups. Once inflation is recognized as a tax, it becomes clear the tax is regressive: penalizing the poor and middle class more than the rich and politically privileged. Price inflation, a consequence of inflating the money supply by the central bank, hits poor and marginal workers first and foremost. It especially penalizes savers, retirees, those on fixed incomes, and anyone who trusts government promises. Small businesses and individual enterprises suffer more than the financial elite, who borrow large sums before the money loses value. Those who are on the receiving end of government contracts — especially in the military industrial complex during wartime — receive undeserved benefits.

It’s a mistake to blame high gasoline and oil prices on price gouging. If we impose new taxes or fix prices, while ignoring monetary inflation, corporate subsidies, and excessive regulations, shortages will result. The market is the only way to determine the best price for any commodity. The law of supply and demand cannot be repealed. The real problems arise when government planners give subsidies to energy companies and favor one form of energy over another.

Energy prices are rising for many reasons: Inflation; increased demand from China and India; decreased supply resulting from our invasion of Iraq; anticipated disruption of supply as we push regime change in Iran; regulatory restrictions on gasoline production; government interference in the free market development of alternative fuels; and subsidies to big oil such as free leases and grants for research and development.

Interestingly, the cost of oil and gas is actually much higher than we pay at the retail level. Much of the DOD budget is spent protecting our oil supplies, and if such spending is factored in gasoline probably costs us more than $$5 a gallon. The sad irony is that this military effort to secure cheap oil supplies inevitably backfires, and actually curtails supplies and boosts prices at the pump. The waste and fraud in issuing contracts to large corporations for work in Iraq only add to price increases.

When problems arise under conditions that exist today, it’s a serious error to blame the little bit of the free market that still functions. Last summer the market worked efficiently after Katrina — gas hit $$3 a gallon, but soon supplies increased, usage went down, and the price returned to $$2. In the 1980s, market forces took oil from $$40 per barrel to $$10 per barrel, and no one cried for the oil companies that went bankrupt. Today’s increases are for the reasons mentioned above. It’s natural for labor to seek its highest wage, and businesses to strive for the greatest profit. That’s the way the market works. When the free market is allowed to work, it’s the consumer who ultimately determines price and quality, with labor and business accommodating consumer choices. Once this process is distorted by government, prices rise excessively, labor costs and profits are negatively affected, and problems emerge. Instead of fixing the problem, politicians and demagogues respond by demanding windfall profits taxes and price controls, while never questioning how previous government interference caused the whole mess in the first place. Never let it be said that higher oil prices and profits cause inflation; inflation of the money supply causes higher prices!

Since keeping interest rates below market levels is synonymous with new money creation by the Fed, the resulting business cycle, higher cost of living, and job losses all can be laid at the doorstep of the Fed. This burden hits the poor the most, making Fed taxation by inflation the worst of all regressive taxes. Statistics about revenues generated by the income tax are grossly misleading; in reality much harm is done by our welfare/warfare system supposedly designed to help the poor and tax the rich. Only sound money can rectify the blatant injustice of this destructive system.

The Founders understood this great danger, and voted overwhelmingly to reject emitting bills of credit, the term they used for paper or fiat money. It’s too bad the knowledge and advice of our founders, and their mandate in the Constitution, are ignored today at our great peril. The current surge in gold prices — which reflects our dollar’s devaluation — is warning us to pay closer attention to our fiscal, monetary, entitlement, and foreign policy.

Meaning of the Gold Price — Summation

A recent headline in the financial press announced that gold prices surged over concern that confrontation with Iran will further push oil prices higher. This may well reflect the current situation, but higher gold prices mainly reflect monetary expansion by the Federal Reserve. Dwelling on current events and their effect on gold prices reflects concern for symptoms rather than an understanding of the actual cause of these price increases. Without an enormous increase in the money supply over the past 35 years and a worldwide paper monetary system, this increase in the price of gold would not have occurred.

Certainly geo-political events in the Middle East under a gold standard would not alter its price, though they could affect the supply of oil and cause oil prices to rise. Only under conditions created by excessive paper money would one expect all or most prices to rise. This is a mere reflection of the devaluation of the dollar.

Particular things to remember:

If one endorses small government and maximum liberty, one must support commodity money.

One of the strongest restraints against unnecessary war is a gold standard.

Deficit financing by government is severely restricted by sound money.

The harmful effects of the business cycle are virtually eliminated with an honest gold standard.

Saving and thrift are encouraged by a gold standard; and discouraged by paper money.

Price inflation, with generally rising price levels, is characteristic of paper money. Reports that the consumer price index and the producer price index are rising are distractions: the real cause of inflation is the Fed’s creation of new money.

Interest rate manipulation by central bank helps the rich, the banks, the government, and the politicians.

Paper money permits the regressive inflation tax to be passed off on the poor and the middle class.

Speculative financial bubbles are characteristic of paper money — not gold.

Paper money encourages economic and political chaos, which subsequently causes a search for scapegoats rather than blaming the central bank.

Dangerous protectionist measures frequently are implemented to compensate for the dislocations caused by fiat money.

Paper money, inflation, and the conditions they create contribute to the problems of illegal immigration.

The value of gold is remarkably stable.

The dollar price of gold reflects dollar depreciation.

Holding gold helps preserve and store wealth, but technically gold is not a true investment.

Since 2001 the dollar has been devalued by 60%.

In 1934 FDR devalued the dollar by 41%.

In 1971 Nixon devalued the dollar by 7.9%.

In 1973 Nixon devalued the dollar by 10%.

These were momentous monetary events, and every knowledgeable person worldwide paid close attention. Major changes were endured in 1979 and 1980 to save the dollar from disintegration. This involved a severe recession, interest rates over 21%, and general price inflation of 15%.

Today we face a 60% devaluation and counting, yet no one seems to care. It’s of greater significance than the three events mentioned above. And yet the one measurement that best reflects the degree of inflation, the Fed and our government deny us. Since March, M3 reporting has been discontinued. For starters, I’d like to see Congress demand that this report be resumed. I fully believe the American people and Congress are entitled to this information. Will we one day complain about false intelligence, as we have with the Iraq war? Will we complain about not having enough information to address monetary policy after it’s too late?

If ever there was a time to get a handle on what sound money is and what it means, that time is today.

Inflation, as exposed by high gold prices, transfers wealth from the middle class to the rich, as real wages decline while the salaries of CEOs, movie stars, and athletes skyrocket — along with the profits of the military industrial complex, the oil industry, and other special interests.

A sharply rising gold price is a vote of no confidence in Congress’ ability to control the budget, the Fed’s ability to control the money supply, and the administration’s ability to bring stability to the Middle East.

Ultimately, the gold price is a measurement of trust in the currency and the politicians who run the country. It’s been that way for a long time, and is not about to change.

If we care about the financial system, the tax system, and the monumental debt we’re accumulating, we must start talking about the benefits and discipline that come only with a commodity standard of money — money the government and central banks absolutely cannot create out of thin air.

Economic law dictates reform at some point. But should we wait until the dollar is 1/1,000 of an ounce of gold or 1/2,000 of an ounce of gold? The longer we wait, the more people suffer and the more difficult reforms become. Runaway inflation inevitably leads to political chaos, something numerous countries have suffered throughout the 20th century. The worst example of course was the German inflation of the 1920s that led to the rise of Hitler. Even the communist takeover of China was associated with runaway inflation brought on by Chinese Nationalists. The time for action is now, and it is up to the American people and the U.S. Congress to demand it.

ROCKWELL: Recently, we celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Mises Institute and Dr. David Gordon, who is editor of the Mises Review, a senior fellow of the Institute, talked to us about Murray Rothbard and revisionist history.

GORDON: It’s great to be here speaking about Murray Rothbard because Murray Rothbard was the person who influenced my thinking on political and economic questions more than anybody else ever since I first read Man, Economy, and State 50 years ago. And I’m also delighted to be here at the Mises Institute because the Mises Institute, and especially its founder, Lew Rockwell, have supported my work over many years.

I want to talk today about Murray Rothbard and revisionism. We want to ask the question: Why was Rothbard interested in revisionism? As you know, Rothbard is a Libertarian who was, of course, very strongly opposed to war because, in wars, there are massive aggressions violations of peoples’ rights and also war is a great promoter of the power of the state. Remember, Tom DiLorenzo talk yesterday, he mentioned Randolph Bourne’s famous essay, War is the Health of the State. We know from Robert Higgs’ great work, Crisis and Leviathan, and other works of his on how state power has grown through war. Crisis and Leviathan: ... Robert Higgs Best Price: $$8.82 Buy New $$18.36 (as of 03:00 EST - Details)

So where does revisionism come in? Well, in the wars that the U.S. has been involved in — sometimes this is true for other countries as well — there’s been an attempt to show that each war is not just a struggle between contending states for power but that wars of the U.S. are somehow moral crusades, that we’re facing an evil power bent on world conquest that we have to oppose. So Rothbard, as someone — an opponent of war, was naturally concerned to counter that. But one thing in his attempts to counter this I think is crucial, that he wasn’t taking the point of view, well, we can just deduce that all such accounts are false, that it’s always false that one side, or the U.S., is right — it’s always false to say that the U.S. is engaged in a moral crusade. What if it turned out to be true in particular cases? This is not something we could just deduce a priori was false. What he thought was that it was necessary for each war to do a detailed study of the historical evidence. In each case, we would have to look at the facts. We couldn’t just say, well, the state is always going to propagandize so we can just dismiss what they say. We have to look at the evidence. And this is where the revisionist movement came in.

When we talk about revisionism, we want to know, well, what is it the revisionist historians were trying to revise. And when the movement came in after World War I, they had in mind particularly to revise Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles, which ended the First World War, and this said that the blame or the responsibility for World War I rested entirely with Germany and her allies. So the revisionists were those who favored revising that.

At the time when World War I was going on, there was a picture that the Germans, particularly under the leadership of Kaiser Wilhelm II, were bent on the conquest of Europe and perhaps the world as well, and there was a need for the United States to counter them. There were all sorts of movies on attacking the Kaiser and the Germans generally. And, in fact, in the treaty — I think it’s Article 227 — there was a call to try the Kaiser for war crimes. This wasn’t successful. In fact, Kaiser Wilhelm lasted a very long time. He didn’t die until 1941. He was an exile in Holland.

But in the 1920s and 1921, there were three articles published in American Historical Review by Sidney Bradshaw Fay, who was a professor at Harvard, that challenged the Versailles war-guilt thesis. And Fay pointed out in one of the articles that there was a claim that, in July 1914, right after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand the previous month, there had been a crown council meeting at which the kaiser along with the various people in the German Foreign Office and general staff applauded war, and he was able to show that that account rested on a misleading report by the American ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Ambassador Morgenthau. So Fay’s work attracted some attention.

And then the leading publicist of the movement was another historian, Harry Elmer Barnes. And he was not only a historian and sociologist, he was a public figure. And he was a newspaper columnist. He was an associate of H.L. Mencken and wrote very widely on journalism.

I remember when I was in high school, I once asked Barnes — this was in the — we were having the 1964 election where it was Goldwater against Johnson. And I asked him what he thought of the election, and he said, “As my old friend, Henry Mencken, once said, I think I’ll sit this one out.”

(LAUGHTER)

I can tell you one story about Barnes that Murray Rothbard told me. Murray was in charge, at one time, of editing a volume of essays in honor of Barnes and it later went to some other — Arthur Goddard took over the editorship. He also was the one who helped — Goddard helped Mises on Human Action. But in any event, Barnes said that when contributors would send in essays, if they had anything critical of Barnes, Barnes would insert comments in the person’s essay. He would put in things like, “Professor Barnes would respond to this point in such-and-such a way.”

(LAUGHTER)

And Murray said, “Hey, he wrote his own festschrift.”

(LAUGHTER)

So Murray Rothbard became friendly with Barnes and he accepted Barnes’ views on the origins of the war, World War I. What I want to go into in my talk today is give Rothbard’s views on origins of World War I, American entry into the war and then World War II and American entry into that, into World War II as well.

Rothbard didn’t write all that much on war origins but he did talk about it, so I know what his views were.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

GORDON: He accepted the view that Barnes promulgated in his 1926 book Genesis of the World War, which was revised two years later in 1928. And according to Barnes, the primary responsibility for the outbreak of the war rested not on Germany but on France and Russia. Barnes particularly pointed to the desire of the French president, Raymond Poincare, to recover the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, which had been surrendered to Germany after the Franco-Prussian War of 1871. And Poincare, in conjunction with Alexander Izvolsky, who was the Russian ambassador to Paris — he had previously been Russian foreign minister. The Russians were very anxious to gain control of the Straits of Constantinople, which were under the control, of course, of the Ottoman Empire. So according to Barnes, it was France and Russia that instigated the war in order to secure Alsace-Lorraine for France and control of the straits for Russia.

I should say this thesis wasn’t accepted by Sidney Fay in his book Origins of the World War, which also came out in 1928. He wasn’t as strong a revisionist as Barnes but he said there was a more divided responsibility for the war. I mean, in the 1930 edition of his book, he criticizes Barnes on this point, but Barnes replied to it. But Rothbard was inclined to accept Barnes’ view of the war.

Now, on American entry into World War I, here Rothbard largely followed the great work of Charles Callan Tansill, America Goes to War, which came out in 1938. Tansill was probably one of the two or three foremost American diplomatic historians of the 20th century along with William L. Langer, who Gary North mentioned yesterday, and Samuel Flagg Bemis. But what Tansill stressed particularly was that America, under Woodrow Wilson, adopted a very un-neutral policy from the beginning in which British violations of American neutrality, such as the —

(CRYING)

GORDON: I guess someone doesn’t approve of Tansill’s thesis.

(LAUGHTER)

So British violations of American neutrality were largely ignored but Wilson insisted on a very strict interpretation of German violations of American neutrality. And in fact, his un-neutral policy led the Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan to resign. Tansill’s work was based, as always with him, on exhaustive research into the archives, and it became the generally accepted view that America had pursued this un-neutral policy.

I should tell you one story about Tansill since I’ve given one about Barnes. Tansill was a Texan. He had very strong views in favor of the South in the Civil War. And once, by some odd quirk of events, he was asked to give the annual Lincoln Day speech —

(LAUGHTER)

— in Washington, and he gave a very furious denunciation of Lincoln. And I think the controversy over his speech was so great that he almost lost his job. I think at that time he was teaching at Fordham. He later went to Georgetown. But he almost lost his job.

So Rothbard relied in his views on American entry into the war principally on Tansill. Although he did emphasize more than Tansill did the influence of the Morgan banking interests. Tansill thought the Morgan banking interests were important but he didn’t place as much stress on it as Rothbard did.

Now turning to World War II, we have a situation where there was a very evil regime in power in Germany. But one point Rothbard made — I remember there was a speech in San Francisco in 1979 where he emphasized this — was you can’t argue from saying that a totalitarian power is necessarily aggressive. You can’t say the more the totalitarian the government, the more aggressive it is. We have counterinstances to that. For example, Cambodia under Pol Pot was extremely destructive and totalitarian but it wasn’t aggressive in foreign relations.

So on World War II, Rothbard thought that Germany was not aiming at the world war that broke out on September 3, 1939, that Hitler was trying to reach a settlement with Poland. He wanted a return of the free city of Danzig to Germany and a motor road across the Polish Corridor. But the Poles, under the influence of — especially under the foreign minister, Jozef Beck, refused to negotiate. So Rothbard here followed the work of A.J.P. Taylor, Origins of the Second World War that came out in 1961, in saying that World War II had largely come about by improvisation; it wasn’t a deliberately planned event. The Origins of The Sec... A.J.P. Taylor Best Price: $$1.88 Buy New $$6.27 (as of 12:20 EST - Details)

And another book that very strongly influenced him was one by the American economist Burton H. Klein — Germany’s Economic Preparations for War — that came out in 1959, which argued that Germany had not built up an extremely large armament, contrary to the propaganda of Winston Churchill, but, in fact, they just had enough armaments for very quick campaigns as in the one against Poland. So Rothbard did not accept the usual view, which is the prevailing view today that Hitler was deliberately aiming at a world war.

Then on American entry into the war, he again followed the views of another book by Charles Tansill, which is Back Door to War, which came out in 1952. And what Tansill argued was that Roosevelt wanted to enter the European war, which began, as I said, in 1939, but he realized that the American people wouldn’t support such a move because America favored non-intervention in the European war following the bad experiences of World War I. So to get into the war, Roosevelt followed a deliberately provocative policy towards Japan, knowing that if he did that and was able to get the Japanese to attack the U.S., then the Axis Powers would come in on Japan’s side, and that’s, indeed, what happened.

So in conclusion, Rothbard felt that by examining the historical evidence on World War I and World War II, it was clear that the mythologies that had supported America’s participation in both wars were not correct, and substantially, he found that there was support for his Libertarian view that war is to be avoided nearly at all costs.

And thank you.

375816,"Awhile back I was driving through the place where I grew up – Edmond, Oklahoma – and happened to pass by my old high school. This wasn’t an unusual event; I now live just an hour and a half from Edmond and my parents still reside there, so I’m back fairly frequently and sometimes pass the school. But this time something was different. On past occasions, I would be hit with a rush of nostalgia and memories of my days there would vividly come back to me. This time, however, I felt…nothing. Cognitively I thought, “There’s my old high school,” but no emotional wires were tripped. It seemed like just another building – my feeling of strong personal connection to it had disappeared.

As I drove on and contemplated this change and the distance I realized I now felt towards my youth in general, a quote from Theodore Roosevelt I had read years earlier came back to me: “The child is father to the man.” When I first came across the quote, it had puzzled me. I couldn’t really grasp what it meant. But as I drove past the home of the Edmond North Huskies, I began to understand it.

Roosevelt, I learned, was not the originator of the quote – he was in fact referencing a poem by William Wordsworth:

My heart leaps up when I beholdA rainbow in the sky:So was it when my life began;So is it now I am a man;So be it when I shall grow old,Or let me die!The Child is father of the Man;And I could wish my days to beBound each to each by natural piety.

What Wordsworth had in mind with these lines is the idea that a man’s passions, interests, curiosity, and penchant for awe and wonderment are born in youth and run an unsevered thread into adulthood. While some adults forgot the childlike joy of their younger years, Wordsworth believed it was still within them waiting to be rediscovered.

This is a worthy idea, and one that few men embraced with the vigor of Theodore Roosevelt, who bounded through his entire life with an unflagging boyish enthusiasm. But when TR professed that the child is the father of the man, he had something much different in mind, as he writes in his autobiography:

“Looking back, a man really has a more objective feeling about himself as a child than he has about his father or mother. He feels as if that child were not the present he, individually, but an ancestor; just as much an ancestor as either of his parents. The saying that the child is the father to the man may be taken in a sense almost the reverse of that usually given to it. The child is father to the man in the sense that his individuality is separate from the individuality of the grown-up into which he turns. This is perhaps one reason why a man can speak of his childhood and early youth with a sense of detachment.”

At a certain point in your life — if you’re like me, it will happen in your late twenties — you will begin to experience the phenomenon of which TR speaks. The person you were as a boy and a young man will begin to seem like another individual, rather separate from your grown-up self. It’s a strange thing to experience. It’s not that you lose memories of your past, or necessarily let go of the youthful ideals and traits that Wordsworth cherished, but simply that your boyhood self and your current self come to seem like two distinct individuals.

Why does this cleaving between youth and adulthood occur? Surely some of it can be chalked up to the simple passage of time; as you grow older, your memories, and thus the attachment you feel to your past, become hazier. But it is also likely has its roots in neurology. As we discussed in our post about twentysomethings, your brain does not finish “setting up” until around your mid-twenties, which is also — not coincidentally, I would argue — around the time that your youthful self will begin to seem more like a distinct entity. The brain of your youth is not the brain of your adulthood, and the latter can remember and view the former almost as an outside observer.

What Kind of Man Are You Going to Father?

All this may be interesting to ponder, but it also has two practical implications that are vital for young men to understand.

First, what your present self wants and desires probably isn’t going to be what your future self wants and desires. When we’re young, we’re typically more present-focused. We worry about what can give us pleasure NOW and not ten years from now. So we spend money instead of save it, eat like crap, and play video games all night long, instead of eating right, exercising, and seeking experiences that will grow our minds and character. Sure, pleasure-oriented pursuits feel good in the moment, but our future selves will probably prefer to have more money in the bank and less blubber around our mid-sections.

Second, at this very moment, you are creating or “fathering” the man you will be in five, ten, and twenty years. So you want to be a successful, financially secure, physically fit, and well-adjusted forty-year-old? What actions are you taking NOW as a twenty-year-old to father that man? Just like one day you’ll need to be intentional about fathering your biological children, right now you need to be intentional about fathering your future self. Will you be an absentee dad who leaves your 30-year-old self feeling lost and adrift? Or will you raise a man who is intelligent, virtuous, and able to tackle life with confidence and vigor? No one can control the kind of biological father they are born with. But every young man can strive to be the best possible father to his future self.

Doing this doesn’t mean taking life too seriously and eschewing the fun you should be having as a young adult. It simply means establishing a set of foundational habits that will serve you well now and that you will thank yourself for later.

As we explored in our series on your twenties, after your brain finishes developing, changing your habits, while still possible, becomes harder. For this reason, your youth is the best and easiest time to transform yourself into the man you want to become. The positive habits you create as a young man will become a solid foundation you can build on for the rest of your life. What’s more, research has found that simply imagining yourself as an old person can increase your chances of establishing positive habits, like saving money.

Below are nine foundational habits that will help every young man raise himself right.

1. Save 20% of Your Money

Many young men will say to themselves that when they finally start making “real” money then they’ll start saving. If only that were true. In a post on the financial regrets of college graduates, we mentioned that the majority of men coming out of school wish they had started saving sooner. It may seem hard when you don’t have much income, but like anything, starting small will increase your chances of future success exponentially.

Make it a habit right now, no matter what your paycheck is, to put 20% of your after-tax income into savings. The easy way to do it is to set up an automatic transfer from your checking account to your savings account the day after you get paid. That way, it comes right out of your account just like a bill, and you don’t even have to think about it. Don’t be among the 25% of Americans who don’t save at all. If you own a car or a home, you know how stressful it can be when things inevitably go awry – the air conditioner goes out, a tire gets punctured. There’s a great sense of relief (and even pride) when you have the cash to handle it instead of using credit.

2. Exercise Daily

Regular exercise provides a boatload of benefits — from improving cardiovascular health, to fighting stress and depression, to increasing testosterone. Thus, there are few habits that will better ensure a lifetime of success and well-being than making a daily workout a non-negotiable part of your life. Instead of trying to get on the exercise wagon when you’re a tired, out-of-shape, middle-aged man with a lot of responsibilities and very little time, make it a habit now when you’re at the top of your game. Regular exercise is a tough routine to start, but once it becomes a solid habit, most people continue with it indefinitely. The physical and psychological benefits become almost impossible to give up.

3. Eat Healthy

If you want to avoid becoming a pot-bellied man, you need to establish good eating habits today. Research has shown again and again that diet is the biggest factor in maintaining a healthy weight.

Unfortunately, many young men develop poor eating habits in high school and college. With all-you-can-eat cafeterias and vending machines all over campus, it’s easy for a poor diet to become the norm. You can often get away with subsisting on pop tarts and pizza for a while because of your scorching metabolism. But as you age and that metabolism slows down, the junk food diet catches up with you and the pounds start piling on. Develop healthy eating habits now, so you don’t have to struggle to do a one-eighty when you’re facing down your ten-year reunion with a 40-inch waist. Healthy eating doesn’t have to be complicated; for a good place to start, check out Steve Kamb’s easy to follow guide to the paleo diet over on Nerd Fitness.

4. Plan Weekly and Daily

If I were asked which habit has contributed most to my success and well-being as an adult, I’d have to say weekly and daily planning. The power of planning lies in the perspective and control it provides for your life; it gives you both a broad, birds-eye view of the maze that must be navigated to achieve your long-term goals, and the ability to manage the small, day-to-day tasks that are essential to reaching those aims. Without daily and weekly planning, you end up getting distracted, forgetting what you need to do, and ending each day with the restless anxiety born from knowing you pretty much wasted your daylight – again.

Recently by S.H. Blannelberry: Gun Groups Are Asking You to Support u2018Gun Appreciation Day' on Jan. 19

On Tuesday, NBC News alleged that the National Rifle Association would not fight a federal universal background check bill provided that the UBC bill omits language that calls for a national gun registry. Kaise Hunt, a political reporter for NBC News, wrote:

Senators negotiating a bill mandating background checks for all gun buyers are privately expecting the National Rifle Association not to fight the measure — provided the legislation does not require private gun sellers to maintain records of the checks, NBC News has learned.

If that requirement is met and key Republican negotiator Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma signs on, the powerful gun lobby has signaled to lawmakers that they would not actively oppose the bill — and not count votes in favor of it as part of its highly influential NRA lawmaker ratings — according to Senate aides familiar with the stalled negotiations.

Not long after the NBC News article was published, the NRA released a statement flatly denying the claim that they would not fight a federal UBC bill:

The story posted on NBCNews.com alleges that NRA will not oppose expanding the background check system to include all private firearm sales, u201Cprovided the legislation does not require private gun sellers to maintain records of the checksu201D.

This statement is completely untrue.

The NRA opposes criminalizing private firearms transfers between law-abiding individuals, and therefore opposes an expansion of the background check system.

The NRA supports meaningful efforts to address the problems of violent crime and mass violence in America, through swift and certain prosecution of violent criminals; securing our schools; and fixing our broken mental health system.

So, matter settled, right?

Perhaps. But, I believe the question isn't whether the NRA would fight a UBC bill, because let's face it, they're the NRA, they're going to publicly oppose anything that even vaguely resembles a gun control bill, so the question is whether they would really care if it passed.

Let me unpack that idea, i.e. what I mean by u201Ccare.u201D See, as Hunt astutely pointed out, the crux of the matter relates to the all-important NRA lawmaker ratings, the main leverage (aside from campaign contributions) that the NRA has over politicians, particularly those lawmakers who come from districts or states that by and large embrace gun culture.

So, for instance, if a bi-partisan UBC bill is proposed that doesn't have a provision calling for a national registry and it passes through the Senate, would the NRA care enough to start disparaging the Republican or Conservative supporters of the bill? Would the NRA give someone like Sen. Tom Coburn a failing grade for sponsoring the bill (Coburn, an NRA member, currently as an u201CAu201D rating)?

To draw up another scenario, if Coburn came out in favor of and subsequently voted for Sen. Dianne Feinstein's ‘Assault Weapons Ban,’ the NRA would certainly crucify him (figuratively speaking) and deservedly so. But with the aforementioned UBC bill, I'm not so sure the NRA would be so aggressive in their retaliation.

This, to me, seems to be the ultimate question. What are the direct consequences for those lawmakers who support and/or vote for a UBC bill that contains no mandate for a national registry?

Because, make no mistake about it, it's coming down the legislative pike. Of Obama’s gun control proposals, it's arguably the most political feasible. It's also got the most public support; polls show consistently that a vast majority of those surveyed support UBCs.

Recently by Andrew P. Napolitano: Benedict the Brave

In an effort to remove the hot-potato issue of excessive government spending from the 2012 presidential campaign, and calling the bluff of congressional Republicans who always seem to favor domestic spending cuts but increased military spending, President Obama suggested the concept of ""sequester"" in late 2011.

His idea was to reduce the rate of increased spending by 2 percent across the board — on domestic and military spending. To his surprise, the Republicans went along with this. They did so either because they lacked the political fortitude and the political will to designate specifically the unconstitutional and pork barrel federal spending projects to be cut, or because they thought that with the debt of the federal government then approaching $$15 trillion (it is now $$16.6 trillion and growing), any reductions in spending money the government doesn't have are preferred to no reductions. So, instead of enacting a budget, and instead of recognizing that much of its spending is simply not authorized by the Constitution, Congress enacted the so-called sequester legislation, and the president signed it into law.

The reductions the sequesters require are reductions in the rate of increased spending from those originally planned by Obama and authorized by Congress. Since the federal government has not had a budget in four years, even though federal law requires it to have one every year, these are planned expenditures, not budgetary items, on which the president wants to spend more money. Congress does not feel bound to obey the laws it has written; hence it has disregarded the legal requirement of a budget. Without a budget, the president has great leeway as to how to allocate funds within each department of the executive branch of the federal government.

Nevertheless, even if these sequesters do kick in, the feds will spend more in 2013 than they spent in 2012. That's because the sequesters are not cuts to spending; rather, they are reductions in planned increases in spending. The reductions amount to about two cents for every planned dollar of increased spending for every federal department.

The question remains: What part of each federal department (Justice, Defense, Homeland Security, Agriculture, etc.) will suffer these reduced increases? Here is where this sequester experiment gets dicey.

The president — who once championed the idea of sequesters and even threatened to veto any congressional effort to dismantle them — now has decided he can't live without that additional 2 percent to spend. So, he has gone about the country trying to scare the daylights out of people: Prisoners will be released from federal prisons, soldiers won't have enough bullets in their weapons, we will need to endure five-hour waiting lines at the airports, Social Security checks will be late, and similar nonsense.

If the fears Obama predicts do come to pass, we will have only him to blame. Remember, the sequesters only cut planned increases in spending. Suppose the president planned to hire 100 more soldiers for the Army and agents for the TSA and air traffic controllers for the FAA. Is the president required to hire only 98 of them? Well, under the law, he has a choice. He can hire all 100 and cut back elsewhere, or he can make do on 98 percent of what he has determined are the government's additional needs. But he cannot just intentionally release prisoners or weaken the military or inflict maddening delays on the flying public in order to make his fearful warnings come to pass.

His job is to uphold the Constitution, to make the executive branch of the federal government work. The president has taken an oath to “faithfully execute"" his office. The words of the oath are prescribed in the Constitution. The word ""faithfully"" requires him to enforce the laws whether or not he agrees with them. It also requires him to enforce the laws in such a manner that they make sense — so that the federal government basically performs the services we have grown to expect of it.

I know, we have grown to expect more of the federal government than the Founders dreamed, and far more than we can possibly pay for, and infinitely more than the Constitution authorizes. But that's the good thing about these sequesters: They will force the president to prioritize.

If he prioritizes so that we stay free and safe, so that the government does what we basically have paid it to do, he'll be doing his job and saving us a tiny bit of cash. But if the president enforces the laws so that they hurt rather than work well just so he can say ""I told you so"" rather than ""I'll work with you,"" then he will be inviting his own political misery or even his own impeachment. And we will have sunk deeper into the abyss of fear, division and red ink that already engulfs us.

219734,"If you have any sense of justice, do not allow the United States government to make scapegoats out of a few enlisted people at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. That, of course, is exactly what Washington has in mind, and it has already begun the process.

When this story first broke, I said it smelled of intelligence and the CIA, and so it does. The purpose of the humiliation and the photographs was to break down resistance to interrogation — to, as the Pentagon so euphemistically puts it, ""soften them up.""

Now, there is one certainty you can count on when you deal with the military: Enlisted people do not originate anything. They follow orders. They follow orders of lieutenants, who obey captains, who obey majors, who obey lieutenant colonels, who obey colonels (full birds, they are called), who obey generals, who obey other generals, who obey civilians in the Defense Department. If ever there was a trickledown organization, it is the U.S. military.

As part of my duty, I endured the two sessions of bull at which Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld appeared. Leave it to a bunch of bloviating senators to make Rumsfeld appear almost heroic. Almost, but not quite.

The strategy was clear. The young Americans at Abu Ghraib were being disowned. Everyone took great care to say they were not typical, just bad apples, not representative of America’s true values.

Oh? Which country has an $$8 billion pornography industry? You can see stuff as raunchy as those pictures on cable television, on a zillion Internet porn sites and sometimes in gay pride parades. Whose commercial entertainment industry thinks the only things that sell are sex and violence? Which country has the largest prison population in the world? Which country, in 1999, had more than 15,000 murders and 89,000 forcible rapes?

The answer to all of the above is the United States. Those kids in the military police unit are products of American culture. And for God’s sake, folks, why would anyone believe that if we are willing to shoot, bomb, burn and dismember Iraqis and destroy their country, we would hesitate to employ torture? The United States is without a doubt the most self-deluded nation on Earth, and that nest of liars who occupy Washington work full time to maintain the delusions.

We are like the lady in the Bobby Burns poem who sat in puffy pride in her fine silks in church while lice crawled out of her hair. We need to go to rehab and recover from the dope of Washington lies and look at ourselves realistically. We are and always have been one of the world’s most warlike nations. And when we go to war, we turn savage. War crimes are as old as America itself.

In the first Gulf War, some pundits ridiculed the Iraqis trying to escape from Kuwait with their vehicles loaded down with loot. They didn’t escape. They were cremated on what was called the ""Highway of Death."" But what I thought of was Gen. William Sherman. When his army left the smoking ruins of Columbia, S.C., the wagons loaded with stolen personal property — stolen from homes, churches and businesses — stretched out for five miles. War crimes were committed all over the South by the invading Northern armies, and virtually all went unpunished. Even so, the South fared better than the Native Americans.

I’m not one of the ""hate America"" crowd. I love this country. But I love it for what it really is, warts and all, and not some kindergarten fantasy created by lying politicians to cover up their own immoral actions.

We are not God’s chosen people. We are a nation of human beings, and like every other nation, we have a mix of virtues and vices.

Do not allow the guilty parties in Washington to sacrifice the young men and women at Abu Ghraib on an altar of hypocrisy.

~ Albert Einstein

Talk about your idea man! The thoughts from the mind of he who would be Secretary of State and President fall like the rain we had this spring in Virginia. When Rummy puts his sparks of brilliance in writing, they call them ""snowflakes,"" short one or two liners that float like a gentle snow onto the mounding bloodless bureaucratic landscape of the Pentagon.

Rain might be a better analogy, because while snowflakes result in a scenic view before it turns to water, too much rain tends to muddy up the landscape. Of course, maybe I’m just thinking about the most recent ideas from the great master.

For example, Rummy’s latest ingenuity is to have the United States organize ""a standing international peacekeeping force that could be dispatched to trouble spots around the globe."" Wow — there’s an idea. We don’t like the United Nations telling us what to do and being incompetent — better if we could create an alternate ""United Nations"" (we don’t even have to reduce, disband, or reform the existing United Nations!) to tell everyone else what to do and be incompetent — but with us in charge! It’s a wonderful idea!

The bubbling over Mr. Rumsfeld has suggested that the United States search teams will ultimately find the smoking gun of WMD for which we sent 200,000 invading and occupying troops to the region. He promotes the Special Forces — perhaps because if any smoking guns are found, it might be the result of a fun game of hide and seek played solely by United States special ops and CIA operatives. Rummy disagreed with the CIA and State’s ""intelligence"" — so he created a parallel universe of intelligence that he can control. Rummy argued with former Army Chief of Staff Shinseki about that 200,000 number — and then refused to say goodbye at Shinseki’s retirement ceremony. Didn’t attend, and apparently prohibited senior members of the Office to the Secretary of Defense from attending. He remains awfully angry at the French, mainly because, like him, they are arrogant, and unlike him, have been honest and correct about the Iraq war motivation and consequent quagmire. Because of his feelings, he prohibited senior members of the military as well as major aviation technology CEOs from attending this year’s Paris Air Show. He seems to like NATO — as long as the Belgians don’t arrest him for war crimes when he shows up and he is allowed to oversee a new parallel U.S.-dominated mini-NATO ring of American military bases throughout Eastern Europe and the Islamic belt of the former Soviet Union, and of course Iraq. He creatively believes that the military has the right to interrogate prisoners of war without Geneva protections, and prosecute without due process those boys and old men accidentally picked up in Afghanistan along with the occasional American citizen.

The list goes on and on. But if you look closely, a theme emerges in the idea generation machine that is the mind of Mr. Rumsfeld.

We have some reason to expect that Mr. Rumsfeld is an imaginative man. One of my favorite storytellers, W. Somerset Maugham, said ""Imagination grows by exercise, and contrary to common belief, is more powerful in the mature than in the young.”

His age gives him an advantage. But on closer examination of his creativity, one sadly finds it predictable, pedestrian, and uninspired. His formula is too obvious: Take something that doesn’t work your way (whether it is the United Nations, NATO, European Union Standing Force, General Shinseki, the Army, France, the United States Bill of Rights) and simply put yourself in charge of it — or a new version of ""it."" Looks just like a snowflake — but unlike those uniquely formed and precious glimpses of nature — each Rummy-gram is imprinted and belched out from the same well-used industrial form. Kind of like how shoes and refrigerators and television sets used to be in the Soviet Union. They looked like the purposed item from a distance, but met no identifiable need or function beyond the factory quota.

Rumsfeld seems to believe in things like the United Nations, a robust NATO in the absence of any of the original motivations for that bureaucracy, and national security intelligence production — if only he were running them. He feels contempt for France’s arrogant honesty, while harboring fantasies that only Napoleon would understand. The oversized and under-trained United States Army would be fine, if only he were directly managing it. If imitation is the highest form of flattery, we have bigger problems than we thought. Rumsfeldian creativity seems to be nothing more than a parody of things that don’t work. While Einstein credited creativity to pre-existing sources — certainly that wise and humble man wasn’t referring to Rumsfeld’s version of global government with himself as the Great Don.

Ayn Rand gives us a clue about Rumsfeld’s true nature in this regard, writing, “A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others.” Even a casual observation of Rummy in action — from his boxing days to his Nixon and Ford Administration service, his envoy work for Reagan, and now Bush’s Secretary of Defense — reveals that indeed what we are witnessing is not a creative man.

When it comes to over-funded government functions designed to destroy and restrict activities of citizens, internationally through occupation and domestically through compulsion, it is hard to say how our freedom and honor are better served. Is the cause of American freedom and honor better promoted by actual creativity of government executives like the Secretary of Defense, or by the current Secretary’s mind-numbing apelike plodding for control?

In the American history case study that is Donald Rumsfeld, icon of the George W. Bush administration, this question is irrelevant. As in the old Soviet Union, your shoe size, personal preference that your television not explode, and questions of freedom and honor make no difference.

Funny how young George never mentioned any of this in his last election campaign. Maybe he and his pals were just hiding their sources!

223597,"Recently by Mark Sisson: Setting Yourself Up to Win: A Body By Science Approach

Before we get into the big job of interpreting cholesterol numbers, let’s review what cholesterol actually is.

Cholesterol is cholesterol: a waxy steroid of fat that serves as an essential structural component of cellular membranes and in the production of steroid hormones, vitamin D, and bile acids. Contrary to what the terminology indicates, there’s actually only one “type” of cholesterol in the human body, and it’s called, quite simply, cholesterol. What we think of when we use the word “cholesterol” is actually a lipoprotein — a fatty conglomerate of protein and lipids that delivers cholesterol and fat and fat-soluble nutrients to different parts of the body. It’s not just free cholesterol floating around in your blood; it’s cholesterol bound up by lipoproteins.

So LDL, HDL, VLDL, all those (in)famous measurements we get at the doctor’s office are just different types of lipoproteins. They’re not actually cholesterol. I discussed this briefly a couple years back, and there’s always Griff’s big primer in the forum, so take the time to go check out both. And also take a peak at The Definitive Guide to Cholesterol for review.

Okay, let’s talk about the most commonly bandied-about cholesterol numbers: LDL-C and HDL-C. What do they really mean? What are they actually measuring?

To understand what these numbers mean, let’s play the freeway analogy game. Both LDL-C and HDL-C, the standard, basic readings you get from the lab, do not reflect the number of LDL or HDL particles — the number of lipoproteins — in your serum. Instead, they reflect the total amount of cholesterol contained in your LDL and HDL particles. Hence, the “C” in LDL/HDL-C, which stands for “cholesterol.” Measuring the LDL/HDL-C and then making potentially life-changing health decisions based on the number is like counting the number of people riding in vehicles on a freeway to determine the severity of traffic. It’s data, and it might give you a rough approximation of the situation, but it’s not as useful as actually counting the number of vehicles. A reading of 100 could mean you’re dealing with a hundred compact cars, each carrying a single driver, or it could mean you’ve got four buses carrying 25 passengers each. Or it could be a couple buses and the rest cars. You simply don’t know how bad (or good) traffic is until you get a direct measurement of LDL and HDL particle number.

Say you go ahead and get those particle numbers directly measured. You’re still limited, because that is just a single datapoint from a specific time in your life/day/week. Analogies are fun and helpful, I think, so let’s take this traffic and freeway stuff further. To get an accurate idea of traffic, you need constant updates, right? Imagine you counted the number of cars on the freeway at 12:05 on a Saturday afternoon four weeks ago. That’s great, but what does it tell you about traffic at 5 PM on a Thursday? Even though it’s the same stretch of asphalt/artery, we can’t divine much at all from that single measurement. You need more data points. That traffic fluctuates wildly is entirely uncontroversial. Any southern Californian could tell you that. But did you know that LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol readings in the same person can fluctuate just as wildly, oftentimes enough to move that person from “desirable” to “high risk” and back to “desirable” lipid status without any nutritional or lifestyle changes in the span of a few mere weeks?

In biology, a single snapshot rarely, if ever, tells the whole story. Who woulda known?

But just because the standard cholesterol test is but a snapshot of a dynamic system in flux doesn’t negate the potential usefulness of getting your cholesterol checked. As much as Conventional Wisdom has gotten things wrong when it comes to cholesterol and heart disease, the two do have a relationship together. There is a connection; contrary to what the AHA might think, we just don’t have it ironed out yet. In my opinion, the most persuasive hypothesis about the real causes of atherosclerosis and heart disease comes from Chris Masterjohn and is highlighted in his recent AHS talk, “Heart Disease and Molecular Degeneration,” and on his blog. It’s a synthesis of the two prevailing notions regarding cholesterol and heart disease — the one which says elevated blood cholesterol plays no causal role in heart disease and the one which says elevated blood cholesterol is the primary cause of heart disease — and it goes something like this:

LDL receptors normally “receive” LDL particles and remove them from circulation so that they can deliver nutrients and cholesterol to cells, and fulfill their normal roles in the body.

If LDL receptor activity is downregulated, LDL particles clear more slowly from and spend more time in the blood. Particles accumulate.

When LDL particles hang out in the blood for longer stretches of time, their fragile polyunsaturated fatty membranes are exposed to more oxidative forces, like inflammation, and their limited store of protective antioxidants can deplete.

When this happens, the LDL particles oxidize.

Once oxidized, LDL particles are taken up by the endothelium — a layer of cells that lines the inside of blood vessels — to form atherosclerotic plaque so they don’t damage the blood vessel. This sounds bad (and is), but it’s preferable to acutely damaging the blood vessels right away.

So it’s the oxidized LDL that gets taken up into the endothelium and precipitates the formation of atherosclerotic plaque, rather than regular LDL. OxLDL, poor receptor activity, and inflammation are the problems. But since measuring oxidized LDL in serum is difficult (oxidized LDL gets taken up out of serum and into the endothelium rather quickly) and expensive, we need other, more realistic, more obtainable methods. We need to work with what we’ve got. It would be great if a doctor could quickly order up an “LDL receptor activity” test, but I don’t see that happening anytime soon.

Enter the various lipid panels.

First up is your basic lipid panel, the standard test the average doctor is going to order for a patient. If you go this route, you’ll typically get four measurements: total cholesterol (TC); high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C); low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); and triglycerides.

In the United States these policies were not called u201Cfascismu201D but u201Cplanned capitalism.u201D The word fascism may no longer be politically acceptable, but its synonym u201Cindustrial policyu201D is as popular as ever.

The Free World Flirts With Fascism

Few Americans are aware of or can recall how so many Americans and Europeans viewed economic fascism as the wave of the future during the 1930s. The American Ambassador to Italy, Richard Washburn Child, was so impressed with u201Ccorporatismu201D that he wrote in the preface to Mussolini’s 1928 autobiography that u201Cit may be shrewdly forecast that no man will exhibit dimensions of permanent greatness equal to Mussolini. . . . The Duce is now the greatest figure of this sphere and time.u201D[1] Winston Churchill wrote in 1927 that u201CIf I had been an Italian I am sure I would have been entirely with youu201D and u201Cdon the Fascist black shirt.u201D[2] As late as 1940, Churchill was still describing Mussolini as u201Ca great man.u201D

U.S. Congressman Sol Bloom, Chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, said in 1926 that Mussolini u201Cwill be a great thing not only for Italy but for all of us if he succeeds. It is his inspiration, his determination, his constant toil that has literally rejuvenated Italy. . .u201D[3]

One of the most outspoken American fascists was economist Lawrence Dennis. In his 1936 book, The Coming American Fascism, Dennis declared that defenders of u201C18th-century Americanismu201D were sure to become u201Cthe laughing stock of their own countrymenu201D and that the adoption of economic fascism would intensify u201Cnational spiritu201D and put it behind u201Cthe enterprises of public welfare and social control.u201D The big stumbling block to the development of economic fascism, Dennis bemoaned, was u201Cliberal norms of law or constitutional guarantees of private rights.u201D

Certain British intellectuals were perhaps the most smitten of anyone by fascism. George Bernard Shaw announced in 1927 that his fellow u201Csocialists should be delighted to find at last a socialist [Mussolini] who speaks and thinks as responsible rulers do.u201D[4] He helped form the British Union of Fascists whose u201COutline of the Corporate State,u201D according to the organization’s founder, Sir Oswald Mosley, was u201Con the Italian Model.u201D While visiting England, the American author Ezra Pound declared that Mussolini was u201Ccontinuing the task of Thomas Jefferson.u201D[5]

Thus, it is important to recognize that, as an economic system, fascism was widely accepted in the 1920s and ’30s. The evil deeds of individual fascists were later condemned, but the practice of economic fascism never was. To this day, the historically uninformed continue to repeat the hoary slogan that, despite all his faults, Mussolini at least u201Cmade the trains run on time,u201D insinuating that his interventionist industrial policies were a success.

The Italian u201CCorporatistu201D System

So-called u201Ccorporatismu201D as practiced by Mussolini and revered by so many intellectuals and policy makers had several key elements:

The state comes before the individual. Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary defines fascism as u201Ca political philosophy, movement, or regime that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized, autocratic government.u201D This stands in stark contrast to the classical liberal idea that individuals have natural rights that pre-exist government; that government derives its u201Cjust powersu201D only through the consent of the governed; and that the principal function of government is to protect the lives, liberties, and properties of its citizens, not to aggrandize the state.

Mussolini viewed these liberal ideas (in the European sense of the word u201Cliberalu201D) as the antithesis of fascism: u201CThe Fascist conception of life,u201D Mussolini wrote, u201Cstresses the importance of the State and accepts the individual only in so far as his interests coincide with the State. It is opposed to classical liberalism [which] denied the State in the name of the individual; Fascism reasserts the rights of the State as expressing the real essence of the individual.u201D[6]

Mussolini thought it was unnatural for a government to protect individual rights: u201CThe maxim that society exists only for the well-being and freedom of the individuals composing it does not seem to be in conformity with nature’s plans.u201D[7] u201CIf classical liberalism spells individualism,u201D Mussolini continued, u201CFascism spells government.u201D

The essence of fascism, therefore, is that government should be the master, not the servant, of the people. Think about this. Does anyone in America really believe that this is not what we have now? Are Internal Revenue Service agents really our u201Cservantsu201D? Is compulsory u201Cnational serviceu201D for young people, which now exists in numerous states and is part of a federally funded program, not a classic example of coercing individuals to serve the state? Isn’t the whole idea behind the massive regulation and regimentation of American industry and society the notion that individuals should be forced to behave in ways defined by a small governmental elite? When the nation’s premier health-care reformer recently declared that heart bypass surgery on a 92-year-old man was u201Ca waste of resources,u201D wasn’t that the epitome of the fascist ideal — that the state, not individuals, should decide whose life is worthwhile, and whose is a u201Cwasteu201D?

The U.S. Constitution was written by individuals who believed in the classical liberal philosophy of individual rights and sought to protect those rights from governmental encroachment. But since the fascist/ collectivist philosophy has been so influential, policy reforms over the past half century have all but abolished many of these rights by simply ignoring many of the provisions in the Constitution that were designed to protect them. As legal scholar Richard Epstein has observed: u201C[T]he eminent domain . . . and parallel clauses in the Constitution render . . . suspect many of the heralded reforms and institutions of the twentieth century: zoning, rent control, workers’ compensation laws, transfer payments, progressive taxation.u201D[8] It is important to note that most of these reforms were initially adopted during the ’30s, when the fascist/collectivist philosophy was in its heyday.

Planned industrial u201Charmony.u201D Another keystone of Italian corporatism was the idea that the government’s interventions in the economy should not be conducted on an ad hoc basis, but should be u201Ccoordinatedu201D by some kind of central planning board. Government intervention in Italy was u201Ctoo diverse, varied, contrasting. There has been disorganic . . . intervention, case by case, as the need arises,u201D Mussolini complained in 1935.[9] Fascism would correct this by directing the economy toward u201Ccertain fixed objectivesu201D and would u201Cintroduce order in the economic field.u201D[10] Corporatist planning, according to Mussolini adviser Fausto Pitigliani, would give government intervention in the Italian economy a certain u201Cunity of aim,u201D as defined by the government planners.[11]

These exact sentiments were expressed by Robert Reich (currently the U.S. Secretary of Labor) and Ira Magaziner (currently the federal government’s health care reform u201CCzaru201D) in their book Minding America’s Business.[12] In order to counteract the u201Cuntidy marketplace,u201D an interventionist industrial policy u201Cmust strive to integrate the full range of targeted government policies — procurement, research and development, trade, antitrust, tax credits, and subsidies — into a coherent strategy . . . .u201D[13]

Current industrial policy interventions, Reich and Magaziner bemoaned, are u201Cthe product of fragmented and uncoordinated decisions made by [many different] executive agencies, the Congress, and independent regulatory agencies . . . . There is no integrated strategy to use these programs to improve the . . . U.S. economy.u201D[14]

In his 1989 book, The Silent War, Magaziner reiterated this theme by advocating coordinating groups like the national Security Council to take a strategic national industrial view.u201D[15] The White House has in fact established a u201CNational Economic Security Council.u201D Every other advocate of an interventionist u201Cindustrial policyu201D has made a similar u201Cunity of aimu201D argument, as first described by Pitigliani more than half a century ago.

Government-business partnerships. A third defining characteristic of economic fascism is that private property and business ownership are permitted, but are in reality controlled by government through a business-government u201Cpartnership.u201D As Ayn Rand often noted, however, in such a partnership government is always the senior or dominating u201Cpartner.u201D

In Mussolini’s Italy, businesses were grouped by the government into legally recognized u201Csyndicatesu201D such as the u201CNational Fascist Confederation of Commerce,u201D the u201CNational Fascist Confederation of Credit and Insurance,u201D and so on. All of these u201Cfascist confederationsu201D were u201Ccoordinatedu201D by a network of government planning agencies called u201Ccorporations,u201D one for each industry. One large u201CNational Council of Corporationsu201D served as a national overseer of the individual u201Ccorporationsu201D and had the power to u201Cissue regulations of a compulsory character.u201D[16]

The purpose of this Byzantine regulatory arrangement was so that the government could u201Csecure collaboration . . . between the various categories of producers in each particular trade or branch of productive activity.u201D[17] Government-orchestrated u201Ccollaborationu201D was necessary because u201Cthe principle of private initiativeu201D could only be useful u201Cin the service of the national interestu201D as defined by government bureaucrats.[18]

This idea of government-mandated and -dominated u201Ccollaborationu201D is also at the heart of all interventionist industrial policy schemes. A successful industrial policy, write Reich and Magaziner, would u201Crequire careful coordination between public and private sectors.u201D[19] u201CGovernment and the private sector must work in tandem.u201D[20] u201CEconomic success now depends to a high degree on coordination, collaboration, and careful strategic choice,u201D guided by government.[21]

The AFL-CIO has echoed this theme, advocating a u201Ctripartite National Reindustrialization Board — including representatives of labor, business, and governmentu201D that would supposedly u201Cplanu201D the economy.[22] The Washington, D.C.—based Center for National Policy has also published a report authored by businessmen from Lazard Freres, du Pont, Burroughs, Chrysler, Electronic Data Systems, and other corporations promoting an allegedly u201Cnewu201D policy based on u201Ccooperation of government with business and labor.u201D[23] Another report, by the organization u201CRebuild America,u201D co-authored in 1986 by Robert Reich and economists Robert Solow, Lester Thurow, Laura Tyson, Paul Krugman, Pat Choate, and Lawrence Chimerine urges u201Cmore teamworku201D through u201Cpublic-private partnerships among government, business and academia.u201D[24] This report calls for u201Cnational goals and targetsu201D set by government planners who will devise a u201Ccomprehensive investment strategyu201D that will only permit u201Cproductiveu201D investment, as defined by government, to take place.

Mercantilism and protectionism. Whenever politicians start talking about u201Ccollaborationu201D with business, it is time to hold on to your wallet. Despite the fascist rhetoric about u201Cnational collaborationu201D and working for the national, rather than private, interests, the truth is that mercantilist and Protectionist practices riddled the system. Italian social critic Gaetano Salvemini wrote in 1936 that under corporatism, u201Cit is the state, i.e., the taxpayer, who has become responsible to private enterprise. In Fascist Italy the state pays for the blunders of private enterprise.u201D[25] As long as business was good, Salvemini wrote, u201Cprofit remained to private initiative.u201D[26] But when the depression came, u201Cthe government added the loss to the taxpayer’s burden. Profit is private and individual. Loss is public and social.u201D[27]

The Italian corporative state, The Economist editorialized on July 27, 1935, u201Conly amounts to the establishment of a new and costly bureaucracy from which those industrialists who can spend the necessary amount, can obtain almost anything they want, and put into practice the worst kind of monopolistic practices at the expense of the little fellow who is squeezed out in the process.u201D Corporatism, in other words, was a massive system of corporate welfare. u201CThree-quarters of the Italian economic system,u201D Mussolini boasted in 1934, u201Chad been subsidized by government.u201D[28]

If this sounds familiar, it is because it is exactly the result of agricultural subsidies, the Export- Import bank, guaranteed loans to u201Cpreferredu201D business borrowers, protectionism, the Chrysler bailout, monopoly franchising, and myriad other forms of corporate welfare paid for directly or indirectly by the American taxpayer.

Another result of the close u201Ccollaborationu201D between business and government in Italy was u201Ca continual interchange of personnel between the . . . civil service and private business.u201D[29] Because of this u201Crevolving dooru201D between business and government, Mussolini had u201Ccreated a state within the state to serve private interests which are not always in harmony with the general interests of the nation.u201D[30]

Mussolini’s u201Crevolving dooru201D swung far and wide:

Signor Caiano, one of Mussolini’s most trusted advisers, was an officer in the Royal Navy before and during the war; when the war was over, he joined the Orlando Shipbuilding Company; in October 1922, he entered Mussolini’s cabinet, and the subsidies for naval construction and the merchant marine came under the control of his department. General Cavallero, at the close of the war, left the army and entered the Pirelli Rubber Company . . . ; in 1925 he became undersecretary at the Ministry of War; in 1930 he left the Ministry of War, and entered the service of the Ansaldo armament firm. Among the directors of the big . . . companies in Italy, retired generals and generals on active service became very numerous after the advent of Fascism.[31]

Such practices are now so common in the United States — especially in the defense industries — that it hardly needs further comment.

From an economic perspective, fascism meant (and means) an interventionist industrial policy, mercantilism, protectionism, and an ideology that makes the individual subservient to the state. u201CAsk not what the State can do for you, but what you can do for the Stateu201D is an apt description of the economic philosophy of fascism.

The whole idea behind collectivism in general and fascism in particular is to make citizens subservient to the state and to place power over resource allocation in the hands of a small elite. As stated eloquently by the American fascist economist Lawrence Dennis, fascism u201Cdoes not accept the liberal dogmas as to the sovereignty of the consumer or trader in the free market . . . . Least of all does it consider that market freedom, and the opportunity to make competitive profits, are rights of the individual.u201D Such decisions should be made by a u201Cdominant classu201D he labeled u201Cthe elite.u201D[32]

German Economic Fascism

Economic fascism in Germany followed a virtually identical path. One of the intellectual fathers of German fascism was Paul Lensch, who declared in his book Three Years of World Revolution that u201CSocialism must present a conscious and determined opposition to individualism.u201D[33] The philosophy of German fascism was expressed in the slogan, Gemeinnutz geht vor Eigennutz, which means u201Cthe common good comes before the private good.u201D u201CThe Aryan is not greatest in his mental qualities,u201D Hitler stated in Mein Kampf, but in his noblest form he u201Cwillingly subordinates his own ego to the community and, if the hour demands, even sacrifices it.u201D[34] The individual has u201Cnot rights but only duties.u201D[35]

Armed with this philosophy, Germany’s National Socialists pursued economic policies very similar to Italy’s: government-mandated u201Cpartnershipsu201D between business, government, and unions organized by a system of regional u201Ceconomic chambers,u201D all overseen by a Federal Ministry of Economics.

A 25-point u201CProgramme of the Partyu201D was adopted in 1925 with a number of economic policy u201Cdemands,u201D all prefaced by the general statement that u201Cthe activities of the individual must not clash with the interests of the whole . . . but must be for the general good.u201D[36] This philosophy fueled a regulatory assault on the private sector. u201CWe demand ruthless war upon all those whose activities are injurious to the common interest,u201D the Nazis warned.[37] And who are these on whom u201Cwaru201D is to be waged? u201CCommon criminals,u201D such as u201Cusurers,u201D i.e., bankers, and other u201Cprofiteers,u201D i.e., ordinary businessmen in general. Among the other policies the Nazis demanded were abolition of interest; a government-operated social security system; the ability of government to confiscate land without compensation (wetlands regulation?); a government monopoly in education; and a general assault on private-sector entrepreneurship which was denounced as the u201CJewish materialist spirit.u201D[38] Once this u201Cspiritu201D is eradicated, u201CThe Party . . . is convinced that our nation can achieve permanent health from within only on the principle: the common interest before self-interest.u201D[39]

Conclusions

Virtually all of the specific economic policies advocated by the Italian and German fascists of the 1930s have also been adopted in the United States in some form, and continue to be adopted to this day. Sixty years ago, those who adopted these interventionist policies in Italy and Germany did so because they wanted to destroy economic liberty, free enterprise, and individualism. Only if these institutions were abolished could they hope to achieve the kind of totalitarian state they had in mind.

Many American politicians who have advocated more or less total government control over economic activity have been more devious in their approach. They have advocated and adopted many of the same policies, but they have always recognized that direct attacks on private property, free enterprise, self-government, and individual freedom are not politically palatable to the majority of the American electorate. Thus, they have enacted a great many tax, regulatory, and income-transfer policies that achieve the ends of economic fascism, but which are sugar-coated with deceptive rhetoric about their alleged desire only to u201Csaveu201D capitalism.

American politicians have long taken their cue in this regard from Franklin D. Roosevelt, who sold his National Recovery Administration (which was eventually ruled unconstitutional) on the grounds that u201Cgovernment restrictions henceforth must be accepted not to hamper individualism but to protect it.u201D[40] In a classic example of Orwellian doublespeak, Roosevelt thus argued that individualism must be destroyed in order to protect it.

Now that socialism has collapsed and survives nowhere but in Cuba, China, Vietnam, and on American university campuses, the biggest threat to economic liberty and individual freedom lies in the new economic fascism. While the former Communist countries are trying to privatize as many industries as possible as fast as they can, they are still plagued by governmental controls, leaving them with essentially fascist economies: private property and private enterprise are permitted, but are heavily controlled and regulated by government.

As most of the rest of the world struggles to privatize industry and encourage free enterprise, we in the United States are seriously debating whether or not we should adopt 1930s-era economic fascism as the organizational principle of our entire health care system, which comprises 14 percent of GNP. We are also contemplating business-government u201Cpartnershipsu201D in the automobile, airlines, and communications industries, among others, and are adopting government-managed trade policies, also in the spirit of the European corporatist schemes of the 1930s.

The state and its academic apologists are so skilled at generating propaganda in support of such schemes that Americans are mostly unaware of the dire threat they pose for the future of freedom. The road to serfdom is littered with road signs pointing toward u201Cthe information superhighway,u201D u201Chealth security,u201D u201Cnational service,u201D u201Cmanaged trade,u201D and u201Cindustrial policy.u201D

373360,"Recently by Gary D. Barnett: Osama bin Laden Causes Yet AnotherWar? AfterHe'sDead?

Last year I wrote an article titled ""I’m Fed Up With Constitution Worship!"" Since that time it seems, I hear more and more every day about ""getting back to the constitution,"" mainly from ""conservatives"" and those of the Tea Party persuasion. I always wonder not only have any of these people ever read and studied the constitution, but also do they even understand why it was secretly drafted in the first place? All indications show that they aren't at all familiar with the enabling power of that document to create a strong central governing system that reduced severely the sovereignty of the states.

I have this contrarian view not because I am cynical or pessimistic, but because I have thoroughly studied this set of rules or ""law of the land,"" and found them to be antagonist to individual liberty and state's rights, and sympathetic to big government. When one compares the constitution that was replaced, The Articles of Confederation, there is little doubt of this truth. Lysander Spooner said this:

""But whether the Constitution really be one thing, or another, this much is certain – that it has either authorized such a government as we have had, or has been powerless to prevent it. In either case, it is unfit to exist.""

In my opinion, there is no doubt that the constitution fully authorized the government that we had and still have today. It is also true that any set of rules is powerless to stop tyranny unless the people enforce and demand compliance on a constant basis. This has never been the case. Even if it had been followed to the letter, it is obvious that liberty would still have been compromised.

Before the current constitution was drafted, there was never any mention or acceptance of the notion that there was a (U)nited States, or that any single nation existed with power over the states. Quite the contrary was the case. It is very troubling that so many Americans have been fooled into believing that the constitution is the basis of our freedom. Nothing could be further from the truth, and nothing could be more misunderstood!

Recently, those like Tom Mullen and Bill Buppert have explained thoroughly why the constitution is not what it is made out to be, and many others have properly denounced this misleading document as well, but the general thinking is still very misguided. Most continue to laud and worship this very flawed piece of parchment, and continue to believe that it is the creator and savior of liberty. Liberty lies in the essence of man, not in documents secretly drafted in the dark of night by the few. The free spirit of the people must awaken before any real freedom becomes evident, and in that awakening they must realize the great importance of the individual and of individual responsibility.

My intent here is not to claim that our original constitution, The Articles of Confederation, were a perfect set of rules, or that any set of rules established by simple men could be perfect. My intent is to expose the lie that is our current constitution. If we as a people could see the truth of why our original constitution was completely scrapped in favor of our current one, maybe a more widespread anger would arise. Once it is accepted that the Hamiltonians in 1787 staged a coup to destroy states rights in favor of federal power, and to destroy individual liberty in favor of nationalism, then maybe more will begin to question their false idolization of the constitution. One could only hope for such an awakening.

Before this constitution, there was no power whatsoever for the federal government to tax. That was left entirely to the individual states. Now the Feds have an unlimited power to tax. In Article 1, Section 8, the taxing clause states, ""Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises for the common defense and general welfare of the United States."" I see no limits mentioned here whatsoever, and given the term ""General Welfare"" of the (U)nited States, there is no reason to believe that any restriction was intended. Many so-called constitutional scholars will argue this, saying that all spending must be ""constitutional"", or within the confines of the taxing and spending clauses, but these arguments can easily be refuted given the broad and sweeping language in this section. This was in my opinion done explicitly by design. Article 1, Section 8 is nothing if it is not an all-encompassing, unrestricted, and explicit enabler of unlimited governmental power.

Anyone can check the definitions during that period by simply going to the dictionary of that time, Samuel Johnson's A Dictionary of the English Language. It is immediately obvious that there was little difference in the meaning of general welfare at the time of the founding as there is today. But this is just one example of the obvious misunderstanding by so many in modern times.

The Politically Incorr... Thomas E. Woods Jr. Best Price: $$1.55 Buy New $$8.06 (as of 12:20 EST - Details )

Under the Articles of Confederation, there was no president. There was no supreme court. There was no federal taxation, and certainly no immoral income tax. This meant that there was no IRS. There was no federal control of interstate commerce. Congress could not raise an army or draft troops. What this meant, was that the states were sovereign, and no national government existed in any real sense. Because of this, freedom flourished, and tyranny was not evident. So how is it then that this very pro-central government, federal controlling, and powerful national governing system could be created by the same constitution that supposedly set us free? Why were the Articles scrapped entirely if freedom of the people and state's rights were the objectives sought? I can tell you; at no time did those who supported the drafting and ratification of the U.S constitution in 1787 consider individual freedoms!

There are those who would offer that the Bill of Rights adopted several years later corrected the obvious problems that plagued the constitution, but that thinking is based on the false logic of gullible minds. While those amendments certainly were restrictions on government power, they did nothing to change the original intent, that being one of granting massive and in many cases unlimited power to a federal government.

The constitution allowed for the usurpation of power by the executive branch, it allowed federal courts to approve and sanction authoritarianism by the government over the people, it allowed for legalized forcible theft by the federal government in the form of taxation, and it allowed the federal government both the ability to collect taxes for war, and to also prosecute those wars. These egregious powers given by the constitution to the central government are completely antithetical to liberty, and should never have been considered by any men of character.

The people did not establish our constitution, nor was it inspired by divine intervention as so many suggest. It would be difficult for me to imagine that God would have a hand in the destruction of our inherent and natural rights. No, this flagrantly flawed document was designed and implemented by a few corrupt men led by Alexander Hamilton. Their agenda was guided not by any desire to achieve liberty for all, but by a grand lust for power and control. Had that not been the case, the Declaration of Independence would have been the guide for any new set of rules, and our original constitution would have been even more scrutinized instead of being replaced.

Instead, after 224 years, we now have exactly what the original ruling class desired, an all-powerful central government ruling over the lower classes. This is a rule by the few over the many. As Aristotle said: ""rule by the few is aristocracy in its ideal form and oligarchy in its perverted form."" The elite class holds all the cards, while the rest of us now struggle under the thumb of tyranny!

733224,"Every year a multitude of lazy regime journalists (such as this one) are ordered by their editors to tweak and recycle a banal and deferential piece on the “best” or “worst” presidents for consumption by the naïve and willfully ignorant masses. These usually appear before the 4th of July. They ritualistically consult “court historians” in the hope of providing a Ouija board luster and enticing panache to these clichéd parables regarding the deification of the occupants of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

“Court historians” are the intellectual bodyguards of the State. They shape and defend the “official line” or interpretation on the State’s wars, its presidential regimes, or other key historical events and public policies. As a result they enjoy high esteem and recognition in the mainstream media and academia. As defenders of the status quo they frequently attack and label their critics as “conspiracy theorists,” “revisionists,” “isolationists,” “appeasers,” “anti-intellectuals,” or other boogie men, rather than engage in civil discourse or discussion.

As the internationally acclaimed economist/historian Murray N. Rothbard noted:

All States are governed by a ruling class that is a minority of the population, and which subsists as a parasitic and exploitative burden upon the rest of society. Since its rule is exploitative and parasitic, the State must purchase the alliance of a group of “Court Intellectuals,” whose task is to bamboozle the public into accepting and celebrating the rule of its particular State. “The Court Intellectuals have their work cut out for them. In exchange for their continuing work of apologetics and bamboozlement, the Court Intellectuals win their place as junior partners in the power, prestige, and loot extracted by the State apparatus from the deluded public. “The noble task of Revisionism is to de-bamboozle: to penetrate the fog of lies and deception of the State and its Court Intellectuals, and to present to the public the true history of the motivation, the nature, and the consequences of State activity. By working past the fog of State deception to penetrate to the truth, to the reality behind the false appearances, the Revisionist works to delegitimize, to desanctify, the State in the eyes of the previously deceived public.

going to foot the bill for Mr. Weller's negligence because, according

to some of the victims, the city contributed to the crime by not

erecting stronger barricades or otherwise doing more to prevent

a man from driving into a crowd of people. Complains Sonia Moriel,

who is seeking $$500 from the city to cover acupuncture treatment

for leg injuries allegedly suffered when a table was thrown into

her, knocking her to the ground, ""The city of Santa Monica

has not come forth and taken any responsibility for this at all.""

It seems that it never occurred to Ms. Moriel that this is because

the city does not bear any responsibility for the accident, and

that her sense of justice should be properly directed toward the

driver who caused the accident.

Imagine if

every driver who had been the victim of a fender bender sued the

local government for not constructing roads that allow for more

traction, or the federal government for not requiring auto manufacturers

to install stronger bumpers! Each time you stub your toe on the

coffee table, perhaps you should sue the manufacturer of your furniture

or shoes for making their products too sturdy or not sturdy enough.

Maybe you can bring legal action against your local weatherman,

who did not adequately warn you that the sun's rays would be especially

strong today, and that your sunburn could have been prevented by

applying sufficient amounts of sunscreen.

Another

example of gratuitous litigation recently caught my eye. On an episode

of MSNBC's ""The Abrams Report,"" host Dan Abrams was interviewing

Johnnie Brown and her attorney. Mrs. Brown is suing the Argosy Casino

in Indiana. Did the casino's slot machines steal her quarters, you

ask? Was she mistreated by a casino employee? No, Mrs. Brown is

suing the casino for not preventing her husband from (gasp) gambling

there. It seems Willie Brown, 53, had been frequenting the slots

and blackjack tables too frequently and had frittered away most

of the money for their mortgage, car insurance, gas and electric

bills, and retirement funds — more than $$80,000 in total over four

years. Indiana, like several other states requires that casinos

provide a program that allows gamblers to place themselves on a

banned patrons list. If those that put themselves on such a list

are caught in the casino, they are subject to fines or even imprisonment.

While it may seem silly to subject oneself to punishment for not

breaking any real law, and even more so to punish someone for entering

a casino by taking away his money (at least the average gambler

gets to enjoy playing the games while losing their money), nevertheless,

Mr. Brown did not enroll himself in such a program. He has refused

to attend Gamblers Anonymous meetings, so Mrs. Brown decided to

sue to recoup the money that was (surprise!) lost at the casino.

Asked by Abrams why she did not simply separate her funds from her

husband's, Mrs. Brown responded, ""We've had one account as

long as we've been together and I just feel that's the way it should

be. These people should not be able to destroy me."" Huh? Unfortunately,

this is not the first such suit, and numerous others are destined

to follow.

Lest you

think these are simply isolated incidents, here are some other examples

of frivolous lawsuits brought by irresponsible plaintiffs over the

past couple of years:

Last August,

Maggie Smith filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Dr. Franklin

Price, physician for her husband, Lawrence, who died of a heart

attack at age 54. Mr. Smith, at six-feet, two inches and 260 pounds,

smoked, exercised little, and had a poor diet, the last of which

had triggered high cholesterol and diabetes. While treating Mr.

Smith for prostate cancer, Dr. Price advised Mr. Smith to stop

smoking and see a cardiologist. For her husband's sloth and general

neglect for his body, resulting in his death, Mrs. Smith won a

verdict of $$4.7 million.

weather is now grounds for legal action. Yes, now the anger of

the gods can be your windfall jury verdict. In Ohio, the Perkins

family is suing Paramount's Kings Island amusement park because

Mr. Perkins was struck by lighting in the park's parking lot.

He suffered significant brain damage as a result. It seems that

the park's folly was in failing to warn patrons of an approaching

electrical storm. Drake Ebner, attorney for the Perkins family,

dismissed the notion that the park was being sued because of its

vast economic resources and argued, ""They could have told

the people not to go to their cars, which are large metal objects

that can attract lightning."" Added Ebner, ""Safety is

not common sense."" Apparently, neither is Mr. Ebner's practice

of law.

A Sacramento

Scores of similar

examples can be found at the Web site www.Overlawyered.com.

In the

current legal climate, where overweight diners sue fast food restaurants

for contributing to their obesity, gamblers sue casinos for having

the gall to allow them to gamble, and criminals sue the police and

their victims for injuries sustained while caught in the act of

their crimes, individuals and business owners have become so fearful

of frivolous lawsuits that they have resorted to costly and drastic

measures to avoid them. Thus, it should come as no surprise that

a Seattle restaurant owner has mockingly resorted to forcing patrons

to sign a waiver

before eating the establishment's new fatty, sugary dessert. When

such lawsuits do arise, it is usually cheaper to settle than to

fight them in court. The results are higher insurance premiums,

doctor's bills, and other goods and services for the rest of us.

It may be that

some of the aforementioned plaintiffs are simply scared and confused

by tragic circumstances. ""Something bad has happened, so I

must be compensated,"" they reason. Who must do the compensating,

and why, are secondary concerns. But although circumstances surrounding

one's misfortune may not be due to any fault of one's own, they

are not necessarily the fault of the casino owner, the local government

where the farmers' market took place, or the taxpayer, either. Other

plaintiffs are clearly just plain malicious and opportunistic.

Tort reforms,

such as a ""loser-pays"" provision to force plaintiffs to

take into account costs as well as the potential benefits for pursuing

legal action, and which thus encourage only plaintiffs with legitimate

cases to bring suits, would be a step in the right direction. A

little common sense in the jury room wouldn't hurt, either. Only

when people begin to once again take responsibility for their actions

and properly assign blame for their misfortunes (even when the blame

lies on their own shoulders or when no one at all is at fault) can

we restore a truly just and free society.

375463,"After being crowned one of ancient Egypts rare female pharaohs, Queen Hatshepsut renovated a coronation hall lined with statuary depicting her father, her highly regarded predecessor, as a god. In the center of the hall, she installed two 10-story red granite obelisks and a beautiful red quartzite chapel inscribed with images of herself erecting the colossal obelisks.

To us, this may seem egomaniacal, said UCLA Egyptologist Willeke Wendrich. But part of the process of legitimating herself in a role rarely held by women was to imprint the space in a way that established her as the great heir to her great father.

Apparently, Hatshepsut was a little too successful: When her nephew, Thutmose III, who was for years co-ruler in her shadow, finally succeeded the 15th century B.C. queen, he removed the upgrades, partially bricked over the obelisks and tore down the chapel.

What did Thutmose III have against his aunt, now considered to be one of the most successful pharaohs of all time? Was he merely sexist? Or was he threatened by the possibility that Hatshepsuts own daughter might try to usurp his throne?

While scholars may never know the exact answers to these and other tantalizing mysteries, they are at least able to visualize one of the most important remaining records of this and other ancient Egyptian power struggles, thanks to the latest 3-D computer model from UCLAs Experiential Technologies Center (ETC) in the Department of Architecture and Urban Design.

One of the 10-story obelisks erected by Queen Hatshepsut in the complex’s coronation room.

The result of two years of painstaking research by a team of more than 24 scholars and technicians, Digital Karnak explores how scores of existing ruins may have originally looked and demonstrates how they came to be altered over time as generations of pharaohs put their stamp on the site that served as the religious center for Thebes, the Ancient Egyptian capital during the Golden Age of the Pharaohs.

Ancient Egyptian texts didnt write about these kinds of rivalries, said Diane Favro, ETC director and the projects principal investigator. So we rely on architectural transformations and depictions on contemporary reliefs to provide invaluable information about Egypts rich history.

UCLA’s Digital Karnak follows two millennia of renovations, demolitions and additions at the religious complex, concluding in the 4th Century A.D. To see a video clip of what the site would have looked like at its most complete state, click here.

Through interactive architectural plans and intricate perspective illustrations, Digital Karnak traces the sites evolution over two millennia, encompassing 63 distinct features of this major religious center located on the Niles eastern bank at Thebes, a little more than a mile north of modern Luxor.

Accompanied by ETCs most ambitious web interface to date, Digital Karnak shows the site at any point in time between 1951 B.C. and 31 B.C., allowing users to fast-forward from a single temple occupying a two-acre site to a sprawling complex covering 69 acres with eight temples, 10 small chapels, 10 monumental gateways, 15 obelisks, 100 sphinxes and even a ceremonial lake.

Karnak is one of the most dazzling sites in Egypt nowadays, but if you try to figure out what any one feature originally looked like, you get in trouble because you have all these elements from different periods standing next to each other, many of which were moved or altered over time, said Favro, a professor of architectural history. We set out to give people a clear sense of the chronology of the sites development.

That’s the goal that Favro and Wendrich, the projects co-developer, are aiming for especially this month. On April 4, they demonstrated the model at the annual meeting of the Society of Architectural Historians, the fields leading professional group, in Pasadena. On April 25, they will present it in Dallas, Texas, at the annual meeting of the American Research Center in Egypt, considered the premiere conference for U.S.-based Egyptologists.

Digital Karnak architects Willeke Wendrich, from the left, Elaine Sullivan and Diane Favro.

As one of ancient Egypts two chief religious centers, Karnak rose in prominence in the last half of the 3000-year-long empire. Still impressive after all these years, Karnak is one of the most visited sites in Egypt and is best known today for what remains of the Great Hypostyle Hall, a giant room with a painted ceiling supported by 12 massive seven-story and 122 four-story sandstone columns.

Even though I have been to Karnak many times, when walking through the temple, especially very early in the morning before the hordes of tourists come in or when I’m in a quiet corner of the enormous complex, I feel history becoming almost tangible, said Wendrich, an associate professor of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures.

This is the place where Akhenaten, believed to be King Tutankhamuns father, built a temple to his own religion, thought to be the worlds first monotheistic faith. The Hypostyle Hall was decorated by Ramesses II, the pharaoh often associated with the Biblical Exodus. One of the Karnak gates is engraved with references to another pharaoh whose exploits may also be chronicled in the Bible: Shoshenq I, whose military conquests took him as far as todays Israel.

Hatshepsuts legacy at Karnak is particularly exciting for art lovers. Holdings of most major museums include statuary and other pieces of art commissioned during her long and successful reign, which was characterized by a flowering of the arts. One of her 10-story obelisks still stands at Karnak. Other obelisks from the reigns of her successors were moved to grace public squares in Rome and Istanbul. Statuary unearthed at Karnak dots todays Cairo.

An interior view shows a line of painted columns from a 15th Century B.C. temple at Karnak. To see a video clip of Karnak’s most popular feature today, the 13th Century B.C. Hypostyle Hall, go here.

The ETC is renowned for making sense of such historic landscapes. Under Favros direction, the team has digitally reconstructed dozens of important landmarks that either have been lost or altered beyond recognition, including Pompeiis Villa of the Mysteries and ancient sites in Rome including the Colosseum and Forum.

Additional features of Digital Karnak include Quick-Time videos highlighting the processional routes of the major religious ceremonies for which Karnak was designed, such as the Opet Festival, an annual celebration of fertility.

The model even helps users visualize how natural meandering caused the River Nile to recede almost a half mile from Karnak, driving the complexs slow but steady westward expansion.

The model cannot show us Karnak as it really was because we will never know everything about a site that is so ancient, said Elaine Sullivan, project coordinator and a postdoctoral fellow in Near Eastern Languages and Cultures. However, it does represent the current state of knowledge of Karnak at this date.

Drafted with the same precision and attention to detail that would be required to generate architectural plans to actually reconstruct the site, Digital Karnak is based on generations of discoveries at the historical site, in particular by French archaeologists.

The Karnak project traces the complex from its inception in 20th Century BC alongside the Nile River in Thebes, one of two capitals of ancient Egypt.

One of the real problems for American scholars studying the site is that all of the documentation, current research and reconstructions are published in French journals, said Sullivan. If an instructor or student cant read high-level academic French, this information is inaccessible to them.

In contrast, Digital Karnak is written entirely in English, a feature that organizers hope will make it popular with travelers, architecture buffs and American college courses in art history, architectural history and world history.

Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Steinmetz Family of Los Angeles, the model will also serve as an illustration for the UCLA-based Encyclopedia of Egyptology, an online encyclopedia of the fields latest peer-reviewed research. Because the model is as dynamic as the encyclopedias other entries, creators plan to update the model as new discoveries become available.

We hope Egyptologists will use Digital Karnak to test out and advance research in the field, said Wendrich. We look forward to making as many changes to our Karnak as the pharaohs did to the actual site. To see a video clip showing the western entrance to Karnak today, go here. This is how Karnak’s western alley of sphinxes would have originally appeared, according to UCLA’s Digital Karnak.

220611,"Telling your mainstream medical doctor that you’d like to forfeit chemotherapy and instead adopt an organic lifestyle full of juicing and raw nutrition to treat your own cancer could lead him or her to label you as ‘insane’, but it could also save your life. In the case of one man with stage 3 colon cancer given a 60% chance to live for a maximum of five more years under chemotherapy, he decided to forfeit chemo and venture into a natural health lifestyle only to be more than satisfied 9 years later.

At 26 years of age, Chris faced a nightmare scenario that he simply did not know how to face. After a visit to the oncologist, Chris was diagnosed with stage-3 colon cancer – and it had spread far beyond the colon itself. In addition to carrying a tumor the size of a golf ball in his large intestine that was continuing to grow, Chris’ cancer had spread to his lymph nodes. And it all happened two weeks before Chris was preparing to celebrate Christmas with his family.

This is the point in which mainstream doctors pressure patients into immediate and expensive action, decrying ‘alternative’ therapies as baseless and downright dangerous. For Chris, he faced the exact same scenario. At first, he succumbed to the wishes of the doctor and decided to go in for surgery.

He was then given a 60% chance to experience up to 5 years more of his life, a life which included his wife and children. This is particularly strange as chemotherapy is not generally even used for such cancers, but for whatever reason Chris’ doctor was pursuing it. At this point, Chris had enough. Doing his own research into the reality behind cancer’s formation and alternative options, Chris told his doctor that he was going to give the route of natural health a chance. A route that puts nutrition and lifestyle far ahead of medical intervention, documenting how nutrition is actually at the heart of virtually all disease.

Yes, the onslaught continues in the comment thread below my year-old piece on Chris Kyle. Here’s the most recent exchange. My comments are identified with my initials:

Commenter:

“Depravity” is a word that would apply to only the very worst governments – Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, North Korea today. And the word “Incurably” just reinforces it, meaning not only is it depraved, but there is no hope of ever fixing it.

WNG:

When viewed from the perspective of those against whom its power is deployed, the regime in Washington should be considered the “very worst government” in the world today – at least in terms of its ability to inflict misery in geographic terms.

In terms of concentrated viciousness, North Korea is obviously worse – but its evil is contained. That regime isn’t able to kill people half-way around the world by remote control, for example, nor does it have the means to occupy so much of an acre beyond its borders.

Bearing in mind the scope of the evil we’re discussing, let’s turn to your next question:

Commenter:

Given that, I must ask the obvious question – if you truly believe what you wrote above, why are you still even living here? Move to Canada, Australia, New Zealand. Unless you think they are more depraved yet, in which case, your cynicism has reached a level of total perfection.

WNG:

Why would you see such a choice as a reflection of the “cynicism” of the expatriate, rather than a demonstration of the failure – indeed, the evil – of the government that has driven him to leave the country he loves? There are thousands of Americans who are being driven to leave this country every week, most of them because they can no longer stand having their honestly earned wealth plundered by Obama and his comrades.

Expatriation is of limited practical value when you’re confronted with a regime that claims the world as its natural jurisdiction. I’m reminded of an observation from Edward Gibbon’s history of the only previous imperial power to which the Regime in Washington can be compared:

“The empire of the Romans filled the world…. The world became a safe and dreary prison for its enemies…. To resist was fatal, and it was impossible to fly….`Wherever you are,’ said Cicero to the exiled Marcellus, `remember that you are equally within the power of the conqueror.'”

Incidentally, “cynicism” originally referred to the view that human actions reflected individual selfishness – or what James Madison called a “defect of better motives” on the part of people in public office. Our original constitutional system, therefore, was itself an artifact of educated and principled cynicism, was it not?

The post-constitutional government that impudently rules us must – and will – collapse. It is irremediably vile and entirely unsustainable. In the meantime, however, I have no intention of allowing the criminals who are running it to drive me out of the country that I love, or to allow them to commit atrocities – supposedly in my name – without condemning what they do.

To digest the matter into the language of a meme: Why should I leave, when they’re the ones who are screwing things up?

Commenter:

When guys like you and Ron Paul start to sound a lot like Noam Chomsky, you know something screwy is going on!

WNG:

Here’s another possibility: Guys like us are sufficiently wise to eschew the sophomoric fallacy that the truth of an idea is dependent on the identity of he person who expresses it. To the extent that Chomsky supports the non-aggression principle, defends individual liberty, and examines official policy accordingly, he is to be commended.

Operating briefly within your own premises, I’d suggest the following experiment:

Translate my positions, and yours, into German, and consider how they would sound if they had been offered in, say, 1941. My views would survive that transposition quite well. Yours would not.

“But that government was uniquely evil!” you will protest with the dubious advantage of hindsight, and from the perspective of someone who is not the immediate target of its criminality, thereby missing the point entirely.

Previously by Jim Karger: Obama’s Third Term? We Have More Pressing Problems

""And, to you tough-talking Neo-Cons with your AR-15 rifles and a few thousand rounds of ammo, here is reality: they will take your guns, and no, all your Second Amendment bluster aside, you are not going to do anything about it. You are not going to take on a platoon of Marines with state of the art automatic weapons and the best body armor you cannot buy protected by armed personnel carriers and attack helicopters unless you choose to die that day  for nothing.

You will either be in the country or out, and if you are in, you will stay in and you will comply.

That is your choice . . . for the moment.""

I wrote that last year for The Dollar Vigilante in an article entitled ""When They Come For Your Guns You Will Turn Them Over"", and it has been republished dozens of times, often as not to vilify the very proposition and its author.

And, even after all the recent saber-rattling in response to Obama's threat to ban certain semi-automatic rifles, I still believe every word of that article. Most Americans will give up their guns when they are told do so. Not necessarily because they are afraid to die, although most are, but because they are so used to giving up what the government mandates be turned over. Guns may just be the next takeaway in a long list of takings by the State.

Others will come to the conclusion that guns no longer serve a purpose vis-à-vis protection from government tyranny because they have already given up all the rights that matter. From free speech to freedom of the press, all that which was once held sacred has been fully abridged. Even Bill Maher, a liberal's liberal, gets that irony.

From a government that once complied with the requirements of due process down to dutifully reading one's Miranda rights, we now suffer under a Leviathan that openly claims (and exercises) the right to arrest, indefinitely detain, sequester, jail, and even kill its own citizens without charges, an attorney, or a trial.

From cops who used to fear violating a citizen's rights, we have morphed law enforcement into a vast, thuggish, militarized Gestapo-like police network that share only one commonality: they don't care about the law. They care about what they want. And, if you get in the way or don't do exactly as you are told, or in some cases don't intuit what it is they want you to do, you can end up face down on the pavement like this poor bastard.

From a simple rap sheet on felons that might be available in the past, the State and all of its appendages can and do have access to your most personal information that can be used to construct vast dossiers that are widely shared through new institutions like Joint Terrorism Task Forces, fusion centers, and public-private partnerships. (That information, by the way, includes the fact that you are reading this blog online. They know. They will remember. Forever.)

Free speech that was once revered is now also in the ashcan of history. The Patriot Act, as only one example, makes it a crime for an American citizen to engage in peaceful, lawful activity on behalf of any group designated as a ""terrorist organization."" And who gets to define ""terrorist organization""? The Secretary of State who reports directly to the President. Even organizations like PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) has been characterized a ""terrorist threat"" by government. And, of course, anarchists who by definition do not believe in aggression against others, including aggression by the State, are set aside for special condemnation as ""terrorists"" by the U.S. government:

“The FBI has described anarchist extremists as typically being “event driven,” meaning

they show up at political conventions, economic and financial summits, environmental meetings, and the like. They usually target symbols of Western civilization that they perceive to be the root causes of all societal ills—i.e., financial corporations, government institutions, multinational companies, and law enforcement agencies. They damage and vandalize property, riot, set fires, and perpetrate small-scale bombings. Law enforcement is also concerned about anarchist extremists who may be willing to use improvised explosives devices or improvised incendiary devices.” (Source: Congressional Research Service)

Freedom of the press has likewise been shit-canned, and now subject to the whims of government. Of course, government need not take much action against the press, not anymore, since most mainstream press organizations are merely mouthpieces of government. But in the rare event a reporter or a publication wants to expose the incestuous relationship of government and big business, to reveal the State for what it is, they are shut down under threat of law. Good example: agricultural gag laws that provide prison for reporters that reveal animal abuse in industrial agriculture are an in-your-face violation of the First Amendment, but few care anymore, even the courts.

So, what's the point? Just this: the Second Amendment which prohibits the federal government from abridging the freedom to possess firearms, a right ostensibly provided by the Founders in order to prevent government from stripping away other freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, is arguably unnecessary now, to-wit, those rights which our guns were supposed to protect have already been stripped away. Indeed, other than the right to shop and go out to eat (neither specifically mentioned in the Constitution), there are few rights that most Americans seem to care about anymore. Instead, they have been gamed by bread and circuses without firing a shot.

I would opine that under these circumstances government would care little whether Americans are armed or not. However, the Feds must suspect civil unrest is coming when the dollar collapses, and hungry people with guns probably isn't what they have in mind as an endgame, which brings us full circle back to government, per Congressional directive or Executive edict, one day going door to door asking not-so-kindly for your weapons which will leave you asking what liberties you have left worth dying for.

468778,"The Arctic seems to be warming up. Reports all point to a radical change in climatic conditions, and hitherto unheard-of high temperatures in that part of the earth's surface. Expeditions have sailed as far as 81 degrees 29 minutes north in ice-free water. The eastern Arctic has steadily gotten warmer, and today the Arctic of that region is not recognizable as the same region of about 50 years ago. Many old landmarks have changed as to be unrecognizable. Where formerly great masses of ice were found, there are now often moraines, accumulations of earth and stones. At many points where glaciers formerly extended far into the sea they have entirely disappeared. Formerly the waters around Spitzbergen held an even summer temperature of about 3 degrees Celsius; this year recorded temperatures up to 15 degrees, and last winter the ocean did not freeze over even on the north coast of Spitzbergen. The change in temperature has also brought about great change in the flora and fauna of the arctic.

~ Washington Post

There they go again. Hasn't the bien-pensant crowd at the Post heard of Climategate or the Himalayan glacier row or the admission by Phil Jones that there has been no statistical global warming since 1995? But wait, let's check the date on that article. Hmmm, the above passage appeared in the Post — on November 2, 1922! Yes, that's right, 1922, long before any gas-guzzling SUV roamed the earth. How can that be? Wasn't the Arctic gliding along in a perpetual state of cryogenic bliss until man turned up the thermostat in the mid to late twentieth-century? Isn't the late twentieth century warming unprecedented?

No, not quite. The Arctic is apparently highly sensitive to changing climatic conditions, regardless of their origin. Scientists know the region was toastier from 1920–40 than it is now. They also know it was significantly warmer in the more distant past. Blaming any of these past warmings on man would strain the very limits of credulity. These changes are cyclical, and often pronounced, as the introductory passage strongly suggests. The point being, the late twentieth century warming was in no way a singular event worthy of mass hysterics.

Global warming has become the mass hypnotic focus of our time, a credendum of right-thinking people. I admit it, though. I am a climate skeptic. I am not a scientist and I well realize that many impeccably credentialed scientists of good will do embrace some variant of the AGW hypothesis. I am not alleging that a pervasive consuetude fraudium grips the entire scientific community. There are obviously men of science who know to crook their knees in the direction of their funding, but I am not in a position to indict the entire profession.

The science is extraordinarily recondite and quite beyond my grasp. Unless you have an advanced degree in physics or chemistry, it's probably beyond yours as well. It is with a layman's ear that I have followed the global-warming debate. I base my skepticism on some basic premises.

Foremost among these is the fact that carbon dioxide is but a trace gas representing a vanishingly small 0.04% part of the atmosphere. The amount of carbon dioxide man adds to the atmosphere each year is a small fraction of that, about 3%. Nature cycles nearly twenty times as much into and out of the oceans each year. We only add one molecule of CO2 to every 100,000 molecules of atmosphere every five years. A doubling of CO2 would only increase the greenhouse effect by about one percent. One percent.

Imagine if you will the atmosphere as one hundred cases of one-liter bottles, or 2,400 one-liter bottles. Out of those one hundred cases, ninety-nine aren't even greenhouse gases and are therefore irrelevant to our purposes. Just one case out of one hundred actually represents greenhouse gases. Out of that one case that represents greenhouse gases, only one bottle out of twenty-four represents carbon dioxide — the other twenty-three are mostly water vapor. Out of that one bottle that represents carbon dioxide, only about fifty ml represents mankind's annual contribution, about a shot glass worth. So out of our theoretical atmosphere of 2,400 liters, we're responsible for about a shot glass worth of CO2 emissions. Or if you imagine the atmosphere as a 100-story building, man's CO2 concentration amounts to the linoleum on the first floor.

Yet this piddling amount is predicted to send this lugubrious ball on a gadarene rush towards a runaway global warming that will bring industrial man to his condign ruination.

Color me skeptical. I contend that if the climate was that sensitive to moderate increases in a trace gas essential to life, we probably would not be here today. The whole darn thing probably would have jumped the rails long ago. Yet here we are. I simply do not believe we stand so precariously on the devil's shovel.

I believe that the climate system is extraordinarily resilient and perfectly capable of accommodating modest increases in a trace greenhouse gas. We're currently at about 388 ppm. Plants shut down at about 150 ppm. They thrive at 1,000 or more ppm. This planet has sustained CO2 levels twenty-five times or greater than we experience today. Historically, CO2 levels appear to share very little correlation with temperature. I do not think that CO2 levels of 500 or 600 ppm have ever posed, or are capable of posing, any credible threat to the environment. I believe the burden rests on those who disagree to demonstrate otherwise. To date they have failed to do so.

Again, I am not a scientist but when I consider the arithmetic I can't help but doubt the theory. I believe it far more reasonable to conclude that the climate system possesses robust natural mechanisms perfectly capable of putting an effective brake on any putative runaway greenhouse.

It is important to first note that CO2's effect on temperature is logarithmic. It is counterintuitive, but its effect on temperature actually decreases with increasing amounts. The chart below illustrates the relationship between CO2 and temperature. If we assume pre-Industrial Revolution atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations to be about 280 parts per million, then the first 20 ppm produced half of that warming, while the second half required an additional 260ppm. Most of the warming potential of carbon dioxide had already been realized when its level in the atmosphere reached about 280 ppm.

As you can observe, doubling or even tripling the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will have little effect on future temperature by itself. SUV drivers, take heart! Your emissions are destroying the environment at a decreasing rate.

Even strident AGW proponents agree that doubling CO2 levels by itself would only lead to a temperature increase of about one degree or so. This is not generally disputed. What is hotly disputed — pun intended — is how earth's feedback mechanisms have been reacting to the initial CO2 warming. Therein lay the great controversy at the heart of the scientific debate, which does assuredly exist despite some rather self-serving claims to the contrary.

Those in the alarmist camp believe CO2's initial warming impetus has been producing greater water evaporation from the surface, which is accumulating in the atmosphere since warmer air can hold more water vapor. This is no small matter since water vapor is about one hundred times as potent a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide in the altogether. It is theorized that this increase in water vapor has resulted in more warming, which has lead to the release of more water vapor, which will lead to more warming, etc., which will ultimately lead to all species of environmental calamity. See Al Gore.

This is the central thrust of the alarmist argument. Virtually all working IPCC models assume a net positive feedback from CO2, which is why most produce a strong warming bias. Yet surprisingly there are no real-world observations to support this assumption. Positive feedbacks no doubt exist. But the thing is, so must negative feedbacks, and it is these that the models — or their tendentious programmers — tend to pooh-pooh.

Apparently, a one percent change in cloudiness can account for the entire warming of the twentieth century. A ten percent increase in low-level clouds could completely negate the warming effects of a doubling of CO2. Even such seeming minutiae as the width of water droplets in clouds can evidently influence climate. Smaller droplets that reflect more solar radiation can reduce warming estimates dramatically. Models can't begin to represent this sort of complexity.

Some studies suggest that an enhanced greenhouse effect will result in a more efficient rain cycle with decreased precipitation, ironically. And lower temperatures. But these conclusions are admittedly theoretical. What is not theoretical is that the climate is a system of gothic complexity that we're only beginning to understand.

More importantly, the observational record has proven rather unkind to the alarmist cause. Earth should be experiencing much greater warming if the climate was as sensitive to CO2 increases as the models suggest. In point of fact, temperatures have been flat or falling for over a decade despite steadily rising CO2 levels, which would imply an overmastering negative feedback. There's almost no correlation since 1998. A nice point to put somewhere.

Am I cherry-picking data that supports my case? Perhaps, but no more than the other side does. To the alarmist, disaster always seems to lie around the next corner. “Everything's alright for now, but just wait until X.” Yet “X” never seems to arrive.

Once again I am not a scientist, but I believe that natural forces, especially solar cycles and oceanic circulation cycles, likely account for most of the twentieth century's climatic variation. Alarmists have attempted to absolve the great fireball in the sky but many scientists contend that these critics have underestimated the sun's role by at least a factor of two. Maybe even ten.

Does this explain everything? No, probably not. There are myriad factors at play, many of unknown strength. The role of aerosols is apparently a great uncertainty, for example. Methane is another, although atmospheric levels appear to be relatively stable. A weak anthropogenic CO2 signal is probably hidden somewhere in the noise, as well. Few claim that CO2 plays no role whatsoever.

But Occam's Razor suggests that the natural combination of solar activity and changing oceanic circulation patterns have been the primary factors driving climate over decadal scales at least. This theory should have been the working hypothesis for any serious inquiry. In a violent wrench of logic the IPCC alighted upon CO2.

The very name IPCC is highly instructive. If the objective of that august body was merely to understand climate it would have been named the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Studies, or some such, not the ideologically freighted International Panel on Climate Change. Its mandate was clear from the outset. The culprit was immediately fingered — mankind. A show trial ensured his guilt. Rousseau surely must have been somewhere smiling.

Urgent action was of course necessary. By happy coincidence, the weaponry required to slay the multi-headed hydra of climate change were readily available in the armamentarium of the progressive Left: centralized economic planning, taxation, wealth redistribution. All on a global scale, no less.

The possibilities could not be ignored. The vein simply ran too deep. The prospect of placing a taxable claim on the very respiration of civilization fires the planner's imagination as little else can. Heady wine, that. An esurient international bureaucracy found a natural ally in Western officialdom, itself determined to mine the deepest resources of human enterprise. Rent-seeking corporate interests positioned themselves to profit from climate change legislation, under the stalking horse of corporate responsibility. They too surveyed vast fallow fields of opportunity.

This ill designing troika, the bête noire of free marketeers everywhere, formed a mighty front that will fight to the last for the cause. Fortunately, it is now on the run. Some are beginning to cough behind their hands. It will not go quietly into that good night, however. Too much money — too much power — is at stake.

Isn't it odd that Obama would raise his cries for climate change legislation to a keen pitch in the immediate wake of Climategate and other embarrassing revelations that cast the entire AGW theory into serious doubt? Wouldn't prudence demand a cautious approach to determine the scientific validity of these claims before committing the nation to an irreversible loss of economic sovereignty and a whopper of a tax increase that may prove completely unnecessary?

One would think. One would be wrong. As they say, follow the money. That will almost always provide the answer. Universal health care is an expensive proposition, official rhetoric notwithstanding. Social Security is careening towards insolvency. So are Medicare and Medicaid. Woe to the politician threatening to raise taxes to pay for it all. Enter cap and trade.

By saving the planet and weaning us off of our pernicious dependence on foreign oil, the administration hopes to skim between $$1.3 to $$1.9 trillion from the private economy between 2012 and 2019. One suspects the two are not unrelated. A drop in the bucket, but still.

373642,"Then how come they’re so obsessed with “officer safety”? So fearful – and not even of any real danger to their persons? Isn’t the very definition of “heroic” an action that requires placing one’s own physical safety in jeopardy in order to secure the physical safety of others first?

Why, then, are we constantly urged to admire poltroons who insist that their safety always comes first? That the possibility of a Mere Mundane so much as mussing their uniform justifies the actuality of a physical assault by them as a preventative measure?

Who not only avoid the proverbial fair fight – but who insist on the unfair fight every time? Who – for instance – mob a 20-year-old college girl, screaming at her and flashing guns – over an alleged underage purchase of beer. (In fact, the girl bought cookie dough and bottled water when six armed “heroes” thug-scrummed her; story here.)

Who bark orders at people with the gusto of Stasi thugs, as in this example:

You’d think large men (and often large women) with large guns on their hips, the full weight of the state backing them up, wouldn’t be so on edge and terrified – so constantly worried that some ill might befall them – such that it’s necessary to pre-emptively tackle, stomp (or Tazer and shoot) women half their size, old people twice their age, gangly teenagers – and so on – all the while demanding that their helpless victims “stop resisting.”

And yet, this is the first resort of all-too-many “heroes” (hereafter to be referred to in quotation marks, for reasons that ought to be apparent) who in these latter days of the once-republic seem positively eager to turn every minor thing into a major thing. Who literally shoot first – and ask questions later. Who won’t so much as risk a tongue lashing before lashing out – physically – against people whose persons may be abused with near-impunity; who have next-to-no worry about being beaten/caged/killed themselves as a result of their actions – or even made to pay financially (sovereign immunity being another perk).

215700,"On October 5, Yale University Press will publish a remarkable work, Leo Strauss and the Politics of American Empire, by Anne Norton, professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania.

Norton studied with Strauss’s students and admirers, at the University of Chicago. She describes how Paul Wolfowitz, Irving Kristol and other prominent Straussian neocons drew on and then misused Strauss’s ideas to further their own policies. Today, these neoconservatives are ""committed to an American imperialism they believe will usher in a new world order."" The advance press information accompanying her book cites Norton’s revelations: many Straussian adherents who worked (and presumably work) in Republican administrations ""advocate authoritarianism and praise military dictators""; and then raises her significant question, ""How Europeans rightly see the shadow of fascism in Straussian politics, and why Americans fail to.""

Bellicose neoconservatives ""came to power and have influenced the character of governance in the United States. Their ascendance is also,"" writes Norton, ""a story of American conservatism… a radical departure from traditional American conservatism…They are not preservers; they are (as they will tell you) revolutionaries… we know that the influence of the Straussian matters. We need to ask where that influence leads.""

Following are quotations from Prof. Norton’s book (excerpted from the Yale Book News and the book itself). Writing and publishing, they are masters of the Washington bureaucratic scene, prodigious fundraisers, dominant among the civilian leadership of the Pentagon. They love talking about expanding democracy throughout the world (at least, the oil-producing world) but care little about favored authoritarians and tyrants. They are the people who led this country into Iraq where more than 1,000 GIs have been killed, not to mention the many thousands wounded in body and mind and 10—15,000 Iraqi civilian deaths. But guess what? Virtually no neocon offspring are to be found on the front line in Iraq or Afghanistan. Up next: Iran? North Korea? Syria? Central Asian and Caucasian oil fields?

The Flag of Our Fathers

""Straussian neoconservatives want a u2018strong state’ with a strong leader. They want an expansionist foreign policy. They praise war and warlike virtues and denounce the decadence of intellectuals. They want women to return to children, cooking, and the church. They delight in the profusion of flags: flags on cars, flags on houses, flags worn in lapels. They encourage citizens to inform on their neighbors. They plan to establish a new world order to rival Rome.""

The Romance of War

""Straussians believe that war makes men manly. War places greatness within the reach of ordinary men. Dulce et decorum est, pro patria mori.

""This is the romance of war. Consider it again. In war, death is forced upon many men: the willing and the unwilling, the volunteer and the draftee, the one who gives his life for his country and the deserter, scurrying backwards as the shell hits. In war, one soldier gives his life for his country’s freedom, as across the field, in another foxhole, another trench, another quadrant, another soldier dies to see that country conquered and the extent of his own empire extended. In war, one gives his life for the Aryan race, another that all men can live as equals.""

Straussians and Women

""Tiny little men with rounded shoulders would lean back in their chairs and declare that Nature had made men superior to women. Larger, softer men, with soft while hands that never held a gun or changed a tire delivered disquisitions on manliness. They were stronger, they were smarter, and Aristotle said so.""

Corrupting the Republic

""The story of the Peloponnesian war, as the Straussians once told it, was the story of a lovely arrogant city, gone down to ruin in pursuit of empire. Athens, the free city, in love with novelty, is led astray by an errant student of Socrates. He offers Athens the temptations of imperial power. Athens falls, and the shame of the Melian dialogues, the suffering of its prisoners in the quarry, plague, and ruin fall upon it in return. This was the story as the Straussians told it in my time. They tell it differently now.

We are on the Sicilian Expedition.""

Marx's comment on repeating history as farce is one of his more valid pronouncements.

Here in Georgia we are reliving Reconstruction, that is to say we are having the first Republican administration and legislature (half of it, anyway) since Reconstruction.

During Reconstruction as everyone not educated by NAACP propaganda in the public schools knows, white opportunists came South, disenfranchised ex-Confederates, and gave political power to ex-slaves. It was a disaster, and led only to the creation of the KKK, the beginning of Jim Crow, and the New South. The Republican experiment in the South came to an end with the managed election of Hays over Tilden.

Well, here in Georgia we elected last fall a Republican governor (much to everyone's surprise including his own) and a Republican State Senate, after a little party-switching. The current legislative session has come to an end with a disastrous display of disharmony and stupidity.

The new Governor Sonny Perdue (I shall remind those who have not learned any French  hell few have learned English!  that in French perdu(e) means ""lost"") wanted to replace the new state flag given to Georgia by his predecessor Roy Barnes with one more beloved of the Southern heritage people. He proposed a referendum concerning possible flag choices  a non-binding referendum, lest people should really have a decisive say in anything  and one of the choices would have been the old St. Andrews Cross flag, which Confederates revere and the NAACP abominates as the Confederate battle flag.

Well, the Republicans have handled this matter so skillfully that in an upcoming referendum, non-binding of course, the choice will be between the current Barnes flag, which everyone hates, and a version of the pre-1956 flag, which has some Confederate allusions but not enough to satisfy real Southerners. Lost is the possibility of choosing the St. Andrews Cross flag.

With such a pyrrhic victory several things become clear. First, only the flag-making industry will benefit from any of this. Secondly, the Republicans who were elected because of disgust at the Barnes flag have demonstrated that all they care about is repudiating Barnes and are not a bit interested in satisfying the Confederate lobby. This will cause all sorts of upheaval next election time. Probably the Republicans will experience another loss as they did in 1877. Of course, the Democratic Party in Georgia no longer represents the majority, so its hold on power cannot but be precarious.

Thus Georgia repeats its history, this time as farce. Who will our new Nathan Bedford Forrest be? Atlanta business interests like to say that Georgia's elite is too busy to hate. Evidently it is also too busy to think.

Global Aging and the Crisis of the 2020s

by Neil Howe and Richard Jackson

""The risk of social and political upheaval could grow throughout the developing world  even as the developed world’s capacity to deal with such threats declines.""

From the fall of the Roman and the Mayan empires to the Black Death to the colonization of the New World and the youth-driven revolutions of the twentieth century, demographic trends have played a decisive role in many of the great invasions, political upheavals, migrations, and environmental catastrophes of history. By the 2020s, an ominous new conjuncture of demographic trends may once again threaten widespread disruption. We are talking about global aging, which is likely to have a profound effect on economic growth, living standards, and the shape of the world order.

For the world’s wealthy nations, the 2020s are set to be a decade of rapid population aging and population decline. The developed world has been aging for decades, due to falling birthrates and rising life expectancy. But in the 2020s, this aging will get an extra kick as large postwar baby boom generations move fully into retirement. According to the United Nations Population Division (whose projections are cited throughout this article), the median ages of Western Europe and Japan, which were 34 and 33 respectively as recently as 1980, will soar to 47 and 52 by 2030, assuming no increase in fertility. In Italy, Spain, and Japan, more than half of all adults will be older than the official retirement age  and there will be more people in their 70s than in their 20s.

Falling birthrates are not only transforming traditional population pyramids, leaving them top-heavy with elders, but are also ushering in a new era of workforce and population decline. The working-age population has already begun to contract in several large developed countries, including Germany and Japan. By 2030, it will be stagnant or contracting in nearly all developed countries, the only major exception being the United States. In a growing number of nations, total population will begin a gathering decline as well. Unless immigration or birthrates surge, Japan and some European nations are on track to lose nearly one-half of their total current populations by the end of the century.

These trends threaten to undermine the ability of today’s developed countries to maintain global security. To begin with, they directly affect population size and GDP size, and hence the manpower and economic resources that nations can deploy. This is what RAND scholar Brian Nichiporuk calls ""the bucket of capabilities"" perspective. But population aging and decline can also indirectly affect capabilities  or even alter national goals themselves.

Rising pension and health care costs will place intense pressure on government budgets, potentially crowding out spending on other priorities, including national defense and foreign assistance. Economic performance may suffer as workforces gray and rates of savings and investment decline. As societies and electorates age, growing risk aversion and shorter time horizons may weaken not just the ability of the developed countries to play a major geopolitical role, but also their will.

The weakening of the developed countries might not be a cause for concern if we knew that the world as a whole were likely to become more pacific. But unfortunately, just the opposite may be the case. During the 2020s, the developing world will be buffeted by its own potentially destabilizing demographic storms. China will face a massive age wave that could slow economic growth and precipitate political crisis just as that country is overtaking America as the world’s leading economic power. Russia will be in the midst of the steepest and most protracted population implosion of any major power since the plague-ridden Middle Ages. Meanwhile, many other developing countries, especially in the Muslim world, will experience a sudden new resurgence of youth whose aspirations they are unlikely to be able to meet.

The risk of social and political upheaval could grow throughout the developing world  even as the developed world’s capacity to deal with such threats declines. Yet, if the developed world seems destined to see its geopolitical stature diminish, there is one partial but important exception to the trend: the United States. While it is fashionable to argue that US power has peaked, demography suggests America will play as important a role in shaping the world order in this century as it did in the last.

Graying Economies

Although population size alone does not confer geopolitical stature, no one disputes that population size and economic size together constitute a potent double engine of national power. A larger population allows greater numbers of young adults to serve in war and to occupy and pacify territory. A larger economy allows more spending on the hard power of national defense and the semi-hard power of foreign assistance. It can also enhance what political scientist Joseph Nye calls ""soft power"" by promoting business dominance, leverage with nongovernmental organizations and philanthropies, social envy and emulation, and cultural clout in the global media and popular culture.

The expectation that global aging will diminish the geopolitical stature of the developed world is thus based in part on simple arithmetic. By the 2020s and 2030s, the working-age population of Japan and many European countries will be contracting by between 0.5 and 1.5 percent per year. Even at full employment, growth in real GDP could stagnate or decline, since the number of workers may be falling faster than productivity is rising. Unless economic performance improves, some countries could face a future of secular economic stagnation  in other words, of zero real GDP growth from peak to peak of the business cycle.

Economic performance, in fact, is more likely to deteriorate than improve. Workforces in most developed countries will not only be stagnating or contracting, but also graying. A vast literature in the social and behavioral sciences establishes that worker productivity typically declines at older ages, especially in eras of rapid technological and market change.

Economies with graying workforces are also likely to be less entrepreneurial. According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor’s 2007 survey of 53 countries, new business start-ups in high-income countries are heavily tilted toward the young. Of all ""new entrepreneurs"" in the survey (defined as owners of a business founded within the past three and one-half years), 40 percent were under age 35 and 69 percent under age 45. Only 9 percent were 55 or older.

At the same time, savings rates in the developed world will decline as a larger share of the population moves into the retirement years. If savings fall more than investment demand, as much macroeconomic modeling suggests is likely, either businesses will starve for investment funds or the developed economies’ dependence on capital from higher-saving emerging markets will grow. In the first case, the penalty will be lower output. In the second, it will be higher debt service costs and the loss of political leverage, which history teaches is always ceded to creditor nations.

Even as economic growth slows, the developed countries will have to transfer a rising share of society’s economic resources from working-age adults to nonworking elders. Graying means paying  more for pensions, more for health care, more for nursing homes for the frail elderly. According to projections by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the cost of maintaining the current generosity of today’s public old-age benefit systems would, on average across the developed countries, add an extra 7 percent of GDP to government budgets by 2030.

Yet the old-age benefit systems of most developed countries are already pushing the limits of fiscal and economic affordability. By the 2020s, political conflict over deep benefit cuts seems unavoidable. On one side will be young adults who face stagnant or declining after-tax earnings. On the other side will be retirees, who are often wholly dependent on pay-as-you-go public plans. In the 2020s, young people in developed countries will have the future on their side. Elders will have the votes on theirs.

Faced with the choice between economically ruinous tax hikes and politically impossible benefit cuts, many governments will choose a third option: cannibalizing other spending on everything from education and the environment to foreign assistance and national defense. As time goes by, the fiscal squeeze will make it progressively more difficult to pursue the obvious response to military manpower shortages  investing massively in military technology, and thereby substituting capital for labor.

Diminished Stature

The impact of global aging on the collective temperament of the developed countries is more difficult to quantify than its impact on their economies, but the consequences could be just as important  or even more so. With the size of domestic markets fixed or shrinking in many countries, businesses and unions may lobby for anticompetitive changes in the economy. We may see growing cartel behavior to protect market share and more restrictive rules on hiring and firing to protect jobs.

We may also see increasing pressure on governments to block foreign competition. Historically, eras of stagnant population and market growth  think of the 1930s  have been characterized by rising tariff barriers, autarky, corporatism, and other anticompetitive policies that tend to shut the door on free trade and free markets.

This shift in business psychology could be mirrored by a broader shift in social mood. Psychologically, older societies are likely to become more conservative in outlook and possibly more risk-averse in electoral and leadership behavior. Elder-dominated electorates may tend to lock in current public spending commitments at the expense of new priorities and shun decisive confrontations in favor of ad hoc settlements. Smaller families may be less willing to risk scarce youth in war.

We know that extremely youthful societies are in some ways dysfunctional  prone to violence, instability, and state failure. But extremely aged societies may also prove dysfunctional in some ways, favoring consumption over investment, the past over the future, and the old over the young.

Meanwhile, the rapid growth in ethnic and religious minority populations, due to ongoing immigration and higher-than-average minority fertility, could strain civic cohesion and foster a new diaspora politics. With the demand for low-wage labor rising, immigration (at its current rate) is on track by 2030 to double the percentage of Muslims in France and triple it in Germany. Some large European cities, including Amsterdam, Marseille, Birmingham, and Cologne, may be majority Muslim.

In Europe, the demographic ebb tide may deepen the crisis of confidence that is reflected in such best-selling books as France Is Falling by Nicolas Baverez, Can Germany Be Saved? by Hans-Werner Sinn, and The Last Days of Europe by Walter Laqueur. The media in Europe are already rife with dolorous stories about the closing of schools and maternity wards, the abandonment of rural towns, and the lawlessness of immigrant youths in large cities. In Japan, the government has half-seriously projected the date at which only one Japanese citizen will be left alive.

Over the next few decades, the outlook in the United States will increasingly diverge from that in the rest of the developed world. Yes, America is also graying, but to a lesser extent. Aside from Israel and Iceland, the United States is the only developed nation where fertility is at or above the replacement rate of 2.1 average lifetime births per woman. By 2030, its median age, now 37, will rise to only 39. Its working-age population, according to both US Census Bureau and UN projections, will also continue to grow through the 2020s and beyond, both because of its higher fertility rate and because of substantial net immigration, which America assimilates better than most other developed countries.

The United States faces serious structural challenges, including a bloated health care sector, a chronically low savings rate, and a political system that has difficulty making meaningful trade-offs among competing priorities. All of these problems threaten to become growing handicaps as the country’s population ages. Yet, unlike Europe and Japan, the United States will still have the youth and the economic resources to play a major geopolitical role. The real challenge facing America by the 2020s may not be so much its inability to lead the developed world as the inability of the other developed nations to lend much assistance.

373120,"Here’s one that demands pushback – as much as can be sent its way.

Arizona lawmakers want to make it illegal – a criminal offense – to film cops on private property.

In (air quotes) your home.

The air quotes being necessary to impart the appropriate irony.

If SB 1054 becomes law, anyhow.

If it does, AZ residents will be required to obtain the permission of any cop before they may lawfully record his actions. The legality of the cop’s conduct is ultimately irrelevant. He will be able to arrest you, if you film or otherwise record him without his prior ok.

This is an important point.

Legally speaking, any video made without prior permission stands on shaky ground as potential evidence – even if the video shows a cop committing crime. The video could be suppressed, dismissed – or more likely, destroyed. And the destruction could be – probably will be – anointed legal because, after all, the video was made illegally.

No surprise, SB 1054 was introduced by a Republican, AZ State Rep. John Kavanaugh of District 8 (see here for more about him). Even less surprisingly, Kavanaugh is an ex-cop. An ex New Jersey cop. New Jersey is a notably corrupt state, run by thugs like Chris Christie – who is known to have used his powers to abuse his political opponents (see here) and steer lucrative state contracts to family and friends like a real-life Tony Soprano (see here).

“Law and order” Republicans like Christie – and Kavanaugh – use the law to order things to their liking. La cosa nostra… this thing of ours.

Capisce?

SB1054’s first paragraph deals with recording cops out in public, setting forth a “20-foot” standard. Any closer and it’s automatically illegal – and you are immediately subject to arrest. But even staying back 20 feet doesn’t mean you won’t be arrested.

SB1054 decrees that one may not record from any distance if the officer “determines that the person is interfering in the law enforcement activity.” Which means he may arrest you at his whim, since there is no clear definition of “interfering with law enforcement activity” other than the officer’s “determination.”

That is, the officer’s opinion. His feelings.

Any guess as to how he is probably feeling when you pull out your iPhone?

But the most noxious portion of SB1054 is the next graph, which makes it a crime to record cops running amok inside your own home:

“If the law enforcement activity is occurring in an enclosed structure that is on private property (i.e., your home) a person who is authorized (authorized? by whom?) may make a video recording of the activity from an adjacent room or area that is less than twenty feet away from where the activity is occurring…”

An adjacent room?

How does one record a beating being administered in the adjacent room? Technology has given us amazing capabilities – but can iPhones take video through drywall? And what happens if the person attempting to document events in the adjacent room dares to poke his head – or his camera – out of the adjacent room to get a clear view of the beating being administered (or the evidence being planted) in the next room?

Under SB1054, that’s “interfering in the law enforcement activity” – all the cop has to do is say it is – and off to the clink you go.

And if “interfering” doesn’t cut it, there’s always that old standby, “safety.”

SB104 states that a cop may forcibly remove or arrest you by pronouncing the magic words: “… it is not safe to be in the area.”

Note that neither of these things – “interfering” or “safety” – has an objective definition. This is deliberate. The entire point of SB1054 is to give cops a free hand to stomp video recording of their “activities” at their whim, without fear of repercussions. To intimidate anyone who might be thinking about recording cops.

Recently by Paul Craig Roberts: The New Colonialism

In the 1930s the US, Great Britain, and the Netherlands set a course for World War II in the Pacific by conspiring against Japan. The three governments seized Japans bank accounts in their countries that Japan used to pay for imports and cut Japan off from oil, rubber, tin, iron and other vital materials. Was Pearl Harbor, Japans response?

Now Washington and its NATO puppets are employing the same strategy against China.

Protests in Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, and Yemen arose from the people protesting against Washingtons tyrannical puppet governments. However, the protests against Gaddafi, who is not a Western puppet, appear to have been organized by the CIA in the eastern part of Libya where the oil is and where China has substantial energy investments.

Eighty percent of Libyas oil reserves are believed to be in the Sirte Basin in eastern Libya now controlled by rebels supported by Washington. As seventy percent of Libyas GDP is produced by oil, a successful partitioning of Libya would leave Gaddafis Tripoli-based regime impoverished.

The Peoples Daily Online (March 23) reported that China has 50 large-scale projects in Libya. The outbreak of hostilities has halted these projects and resulted in 30,000 Chinese workers being evacuated from Libya. Chinese companies report that they expect to lose hundreds of millions of yuan.

China is relying on Africa, principally Libya, Angola, and Nigeria, for future energy needs. In response to Chinas economic engagement with Africa, Washington is engaging the continent militarily with the US African Command (AFRICOM) created by President George W. Bush in 2007. Forty-nine African countries agreed to participate with Washington in AFRICOM, but Gaddafi refused, thus creating a second reason for Washington to target Libya for takeover.

A third reason for targeting Libya is that Libya and Syria are the only two countries with Mediterranean sea coasts that are not under the control or influence of Washington. Suggestively, protests also have broken out in Syria. Whatever Syrians might think of their government, after watching Iraqs fate and now Libyas it is unlikely that Syrians would set themselves up for US military intervention. Both the CIA and Mossad are known to use social networking sites to foment protests and to spread disinformation. These intelligence services are the likely conspirators that the Syrian and Libyan governments blame for the protests.

Caught off guard by protests in Tunisia and Egypt, Washington realized that protests could be used to remove Gaddafi and Assad. The humanitarian excuse for intervening in Libya is not credible considering Washingtons go-ahead to the Saudi military to crush the protests in Bahrain, the home base for the US Fifth Fleet.

If Washington succeeds in overthrowing the Assad government in Syria, Russia would lose its Mediterranean naval base at the Syrian port of Tartus. Thus, Washington has much to gain if it can use the cloak of popular rebellion to eject both China and Russia from the Mediterranean. Romes mare nostrum (our sea) would become Washingtons mare nostrum.

Gaddafi must go, declared Obama. How long before we also hear, Assad must go?

The American captive press is at work demonizing both Gaddafi and Assad, an eye doctor who returned to Syria from London to head the government after his fathers death.

The hypocrisy passes unremarked when Obama calls Gaddafi and Assad dictators. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the American president has been a Caesar. Based on nothing more than a Justice Department memo, George W. Bush was declared to be above US statutory law, international law, and the power of Congress as long as he was acting in his role as commander-in-chief in the war on terror.

Caesar Obama has done Bush one step better. Caesar Obama has taken the US to war against Libya without even the pretense of asking Congress for authorization. This is an impeachable offense, but an impotent Congress is unable to protect its power. By accepting the claims of executive authority, Congress has acquiesced to Caesarism. The American people have no more control over their government than do people in countries ruled by dictators.

Washingtons quest for world hegemony is driving the world toward World War III. China is no less proud than was Japan in the 1930s and is unlikely to submit to being bullied and governed by what China regards as the decadent West. Russias resentment to its military encirclement is rising. Washingtons hubris can lead to fatal miscalculation.

117150,"$$70 million was a lot of money for me at the time. And I couldn’t sleep at night until I gave back every dollar to the people who gave it to me.

I was running the sort of fund where people gave me money and then I invested it in other funds. The only problem was, I couldn’t figure out what funds were total scams and what funds were legit. In retrospect, I think about 9 or 10 of the 12 funds I was invested in were total scams.

For instance, and this is all in the SEC filings, one fund manager stole $$10 million from his fund that I was invested in. He then paid a $$50,000 fine when he was caught. Now he’s nowhere. I mean, he’s somewhere but I can’t find him. We’re Facebook friends but the last update was him sitting on a beach and it was updated about five years ago.

My investors were furious. They had been making money every month with me. They didn’t want their money back. When I told them I was going to give them their money back, with profits, they were so upset many of them The Power of No: Becau... James Altucher Best Price: $$2.50 Buy New $$5.14 (as of 03:35 EST - Details) didn’t want me to take a fee.

In every business I had ever started, even ones that had totally failed, I had kept good relations with the investors. Except for this one. Not a single relationship survived even though I had made money for everyone.

When you can’t figure out how you are making money. It’s time to change.

In 1998 when kids in high school were learning how to make websites, I sold my website design business for $$15 million. Two years later almost all website design businesses were out of business.

And now in 2006, when no matter how hard I tried to figure it out it seemed like the world economy had gone crazy and I didn’t understand how these funds were making money. I pulled out all the money.

But I needed something to do or I would quickly go broke. I don’t want to act here like I was totally altruistic. I was so miserable all the time. I felt like I had failed and I was also having problems in my marriage. The sort of problems where you’d get in an argument and get kicked out of a car in the middle of nowhere.

I decided to do the only thing I knew how to do and the only thing that has ever made me money ever. Choose Yourself! James Altucher Best Price: $$2.47 Buy New $$6.50 (as of 04:10 EST - Details)

I took one thing I loved and married it to another thing I loved. And, thus, created a new thing. I loved Internet businesses, having built and sold one. And I loved the financial business, despite the fact that it was almost all a scam.

– I shut down my fund.

Then, each step that follows was critical to success. If I missed one of these steps I would’ve failed. Each step was a small step. If you focus on big steps, you’ll slip on the small steps.

1) I spec-ed out a website I wanted to make: a financial site that had no news on it but was focused on building community by exchanging ideas. I wanted to give people a way to make good decisions on their own.

When I say “spec”, I wrote down what all the buttons on the front page would do and what other content would appear on the front page. I completely defined the next five layers of the site and what buttons and actions and content would occur on each page. 40 Alternatives to Col... James Altucher Best Price: $$8.91 Buy New $$4.95 (as of 04:05 EST - Details)

2) Once I had the spec, I went to a firm in India and asked them to design five pages of the website. Just the design. No code. This cost me $$500.

3) I showed a potential distribution partner (thestreet.com) those pages and worked out a deal where they would help me get traffic AND they would place ads in exchange for 50% ownership. They had a billion pageviews a year so I said, “YES!!” (Actually, not quite true. I said, I was thinking 3% ownership for them and Tom said, “No, 50%” and then I said, “YES!!”)

4) I paid the Indian firm to finish the site. This cost $$2000. Then I came up with more ideas for the site and more ideas and more ideas and although we did a soft launch at version 1.0, we did a hard launch at version 5.0 about five months later.

5) I got my friends to use the site. First I created over 700 fake users and manually entered in probably over 10,000 pieces of data onto the site just to make it useful right away. Don’t be afraid to do things manually to get things going on your site. Even with user-generated content it’s ok if you are the first 1000 users if you expect a million users to benefit from it.

Every successful business, even Google, Facebook, Twitter, started with a combination of manual improvements and friends of the founders using the site. I Was Blind But Now I ... James Altucher Best Price: $$1.69 Buy New $$12.21 (as of 03:55 EST - Details)

– I got my friends to write reviews of the site on their popular blogs. I wrote articles that would link back to the useful content on the site. I guest blogged on many different websites. This is how you get users back to your site.

Everyone asks me, “how do I get users to my site”. The above is the answer. It’s the only answer.

Don’t forget: when you start a website, it’s not yet a trusted site. So you have to bring people from a trusted site to your site to build up the trust in your site.

This is true for any site: financial sites, bird-watching sites, weight loss sites, sports sites, whatever.

– I created three areas of community on the site: a way for people to message and have “friends”. A user-generated forum system, and a Q&A system. The Q&A system in particular generated 40% of the traffic the day after it launched.

– I had ads on every page at this point. A million users a month. And no employees. So we were profitable. We were making about $$100,000 a month with zero employees in just four months. Being too afraid to build this into a big business, I sold the site almost instantly. Trade Like Warren Buffett James Altucher Best Price: $$7.96 Buy New $$28.99 (as of 01:20 EST - Details)

I could’ve used other examples. I could’ve used the debit card business I started. The delivery service I started. The mental health hospital I was involved in. The billion revenues business I’m on the board of directors of and the many other businesses I’ve advised and consulted with and invested in.

But the lessons are all the same.

LESSONS LEARNED

– GET DOWN ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES AND SCRUB. Even when something is scalable, don’t be afraid to get down on your hands and knees and be the first part of that scaling. Don’t expect anonymous users to do all your initial hard work. Don’t expect computers to do all your initial hard work.

YOU do all your initial hard work. How I Found Freedom in... Harry Browne Check Amazon for Pricing.

– FREE CONTENT ON THE FRONT PAGE: I had so much free content available it obscured the design. Everyone cares too much about design. Value is 10x more important than design.

– OUTSOURCE IN INCREMENTAL STAGES. First we designed pages, then after we knew we were going to get big distribution, we made the rest of the site. Then, based on user feedback and more ideas, we designed four more versions before an official launch. The site changed drastically from version 1.0 to version 5.0.

– DIVERSIFY YOUR DISTRIBUTION. Although there was one primary source of distribution (thestreet.com) where I was getting traffic from, I also worked out deals to get traffic from AOL. Yahoo, Forbes, Reuters, and basic advertising.

– HERE’S HOW TO NOT WORRY ABOUT COMPETITION. I had competition but they were doing the “build it and they will come” technique. 95% of businesses forget that it’s important to be the first heavy users of your product. The Secret of Selling ... Harry Browne Check Amazon for Pricing.

A restaurant is a great example of this. The initial success of a pizza restaurant doesn’t depend just on how good the pizza is, but how many of your friends and their friends come in the door to buy it. Don’t be afraid to call everyone in your rolodex to come on over and try the pizza.

Actually, this is not quite true either. When I first realized I had competition, I cried. I actually called the developers in India and told them it was all over. They had to cheer me up. One thing I learned ultimately, was that the biggest asset the business had was the passion my partner and I had for it. That passion was much higher than the passion of our competitors so we ended up creating and implementing the best ideas. End of competition.

– I DIDN’T KNOW ANYONE. I cold-called Yahoo, AOL, and Forbes to get on their radar.

In fact, I had a “negative network”. The first guy I called at Yahoo said he knew me. “Oh yeah?” I said because I had no idea who he was.

He said, “yeah, I invested in your wireless Internet business and lost my investment.” Amazon.com Gift Card i... Check Amazon for Pricing.

You would think that would have hurt my chances. Yahoo became one of my biggest sources of distribution after that call. That guy became my biggest advocate within Yahoo.

The key is to anticipate what they might want, show them how it will cost them nothing but they will get huge benefit from it, and then just simply do it. Make it as easy as possible for the other side to say “yes” before you ask them.

If you want someone to say “yes”, show them exactly what “yes” looks like and show them that it is already made.

– COMBINE INTERESTS: I had been 20 years already in the technology business (since I was in college). And I had been in the financial industry for about seven years then. So I combined interests and made the best financial website. Nobody else was as well-placed in this intersection as I was.

– MAKE THE BUSINESS YOU WOULD USE: I wanted a site with no news, but tons of interesting ideas, perspectives, ideas, and community.

Investing based on news is the fastest way to poverty but it is very common in the hedge fund business for professional investors to call each other and exchange ideas. Hedge fund managers are on the phone all day with each other.

I made it very simple for everyone, and not just hedge fund managers, to do that online.

– ABD: Always be dealmaking. Even though I had a 50% distribution partner right from the beginning I was constantly meeting with companies and people to see what extra deals I could make.

I would come up with ideas about the value I could deliver them and then I would offer up that value. Maybe they needed a white label version of my site. Maybe they needed content from my site. Maybe they needed their blog to be distributed on my site, maybe they wanted their newsletter sold on my site.

I did any deal I could do. Until finally I sold the site. But that wasn’t even the final deal. I stuck with it and the site continued to grow.

– NOTHING IS A STRAIGHT LINE. There were constant cases where the code was bad on the site and the site would crash if it had too many users at the same time. Every other week I thought I was going to have a heart attack because the site kept crashing.

And some companies were very slow to do deals with me. Some companies outright rejected me (Google). You can’t be bitter or burn bridges. There may come another day, another company, or all the people at Google might move to other places where you do business with. The key here is to always stay in touch and provide monthly updates showing how you are improving things. Always be willing to help people no matter what.

– HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN TO GIVE UP?

Every step of the way I was willing to give up if I didn’t see some form of traction. Sometimes that meant more users. Sometimes that meant more profits. Sometimes that meant more technology that I really liked and ideas implemented that people wrote great reviews about.

– BUILD COMMUNITY BY HAND. I traveled around the country holding meetups with the most active users so I could see with my own eyes how the site was helping people. It was exciting to me. As long as I had that excitement, I knew something was working.

The people who showed up at those meetups became almost like ambassadors for the site. They were so active they used the site more than me. Nothing beats face to face meeting to build your ambassadors.

Why did I go myself to most of these meetups?

There’s a saying in Argentina, “When the CEO is looking, the cow grows fatter”. A business builds fastest when the CEO is looking at it. There’s a thousand details that the CEO sees. There’s 100 details that the COO sees. There’s 10 details that the regular employee sees. And details slip through the cracks when there is nobody.

At the same time I had also started a dating site (or four) and none of them got traction even though the sites were beautiful and I had smoked my own crack and thought the businesses were great. But no users equals no traction.

Perseverance is like a fire that needs oxygen.

Love is the oxygen for perseverance. You can love it. Users can love it. Partners can love it. Investors can love it. There are a lot of sources of love. Businesses and humans need love to live.

Ultimately, you create value for people and that’s how you build the love.

Business is just the delivery mechanism of that love.

Then love + perseverance = abundance.

I sold that business for $$10 million and then two years later I was dead broke because once again I forgot all about love. I squandered the love.

So I had to start from scratch again. Which I did.

225174,"For the third time in my life, the Social Security System will go belly-up.

The first time was in 1977 — well, almost. To head off the bust, Jimmy Carter got Congress to pass a major FICA tax increase — sorry, “contribution” increase — in order to save Social Security. The rate would be hiked in phases from 2% to 6.15% (times two: employee and employer). He promised: “Now this legislation will guarantee that from 1980 to the year 2030, the Social Security funds will be sound.” (http://tinyurl.com/ybksxs4)

Carter’s projection was off by a Georgia country mile. In 1983, the SSA program technically went bankrupt. Reagan signed a law that speeded up Carter’s rate increases, added Congressional employees to Social Security, and delayed the age of eligibility. (http://tinyurl.com/ybksxs4)

Unless there is another Social Security tax increase in 2010, the system will go into red ink mode and stay there.

The public has not been informed of this, which comes as no surprise. There have been a few scattered stories on the Web, but nothing sustained. The media do not want to admit that the jointly operated Social Security program and Medicare program are going to bankrupt the Federal government if they are not cut back drastically.

They are never cut back. They always expand.

Medicare’s Hospital Insurance program has been in red ink mode for two years. The public does not know this, either. To cover the program’s insolvency, the government is quietly funding the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund with bailouts from the general fund.

Politically, this creates a problem. When the Treasury taps the general fund, the expenditure appears on the budget — the on-budget budget — as an expenditure. This immediately adds to the deficit, meaning the visible deficit, the one that gets recorded on those wonderful U.S. debt clocks.

When revenues flow into the four Social Security and Medicare trust funds, the money is instantly handed over to the Treasury, which issues non-marketable long-term IOU’s to the trust funds. These IOU’s are listed as assets by the funds. But, through the wonders of government accounting, they are not listed as liabilities on the government’s on-budget budget. They are liabilities only on the off-budget budget, which most Americans are unaware of. This chicanery has been going on ever since the Johnson Administration (Lyndon’s, not Andrew’s).

The problem facing the politicians is this: when a trust fund is no longer showing a surplus of revenues over expenditures, it has to sell its assets back to the Treasury. The Treasury’s non-listed liabilities must be converted into money to send to the legal recipients. This is a red alert of hidden red ink. The public finds out. The debt clocks speed up.

The Treasury has no money in reserve. Every dollar that it takes in immediately flows out. So, it must get Congress to provide the money for the deficit-running trust funds, either by taxing or by borrowing (increasing the legal debt ceiling).

What’s a Congress to do?

HIDING THE BUST

The Congressional Budget Office released a report in July on the condition of the Social Security trust finds. There are two funds: Old Age Insurance and Disability Insurance. Think of them as “geezers and gimps.” Combined, they are called OASDI. The report offered a table of numbers showing inflow and outflow. It is here.

The table is tricky to interpret. This is deliberate. The political strategy has always been concealment. But if we think through what is being reported in this table, we can spot the ringer.

The ringer is interest payments to the trust funds. The Treasury issued the IOU’s, so it must pay the trust funds interest.

Think: “Where does the Treasury get the money?”

Answer: “The general fund.” Up go the debt clocks.

Look at the figures projected for 2009. Income from revenues (FICA) is $$653 billion. Total income is $$808 billion. Where did the extra income come from? Three sources.

Taxes on benefits: $$21 billion

Federal employer share: $$14 billion

Interest: $$120 billion

This means that the U.S. government has to pony up an extra $$134 billion to pay to itself: $$14 billion in taxes paid on behalf of Federal workers plus $$120 billion in interest. This is counted as revenue for the OASDI Trust Fund, but it is red ink for the government.

Neat!

Now let’s do a reality check. Subtract $$134 billion from the $$808 billion reported as total income to the OASDI Trust Fund. Why subtract it? Because this is not income coming from outside the government. We get $$674 billion.

What is the expected outgo? $$670 billion. The official budget surplus for the OASDI Trust Fund: $$138 billion ($$808b minus $$670b). This is reported by the CBO under “Surplus.” This looks pretty good. For the Trust Fund, it is pretty good.

For the government, the real figure is barely in the black. The official on-budget, count-the-subsidy-as-a-subsidy OASDI surplus for the U.S. government: $$4 billion ($$674b minus $$670b).

This is never mentioned by the CBO. We are expected to figure this out. No one does. It took me several minutes to spot the ringer.

Now let us look at the projections for 2010. Income for the trust funds: $$811 billion.

Taxes on benefits: $$20 billion

Federal employer share: $$15 billion

Interest: $$118 billion

Let us remove the U.S. government’s payments into the fund: $$133 billion ($$15b + $$118b). This must be covered by the general fund. Subtract this from total income to the OASDI fund: $$811b minus $$133b = $$678b.

The expected outgo is $$703 billion.

The deficit for the OASDI program in 2010 will be $$25 billion ($$703b minus $$678b).

Some people will regard the “Federal employer share” as non-subsidy: $$15 billion. I’ll concede this in practice, although I still think this is money extracted by taxes paid into the general fund. Even with this money removed, Social Security will run a $$10 billion deficit in 2010.

Social Security will go bust in 2010, if CBO projections are correct.

What do I mean by “bust”? I mean technically insolvent — you know, like the nation’s biggest banks in September 2008, before the government’s bailout and the Federal Reserve’s swap at face value of T-bills for toxic debt held by the banks.

I mean by “bust” the inability of the Social Security System to pay its bills by means of money extracted from the public by way of FICA “contributions.”

Think of the Social Security System as Oliver Twist in the workhouse, gruel bowl in hand. “Please, sir, may I have some more?” Unlike Bumble, the Treasury dips its ladle into the gruel and then fills up the bowl. For how long? Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.

THE ACCOUNTING DECEPTION WORKS

The accounting scam of the Social Security Trust Fund has worked politically for a generation. It is not just the voters who are fooled. The best and the brightest in the media have been taken in. Here is an exchange that took place on the PBS show, Nightly Business Report, on March 25, 2009.

GERSH: A negative cash flow does not mean Social Security is in crisis. The program has built up an enormous trust fund over two decades. Barbara Kennelly is president of the Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. She says the trust fund is more than enough to cover any short-term financial hit.

BARBARA KENNELLY, PRES., NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO PRESERVE SOCIAL SECURITY & MEDICARE: The trustees look at it every single year, the report is going to come out at the end of this month. And you’re going to still see that we can pay those benefits way out. Say it’s not 2041, it’s 2040 or 2039. But we have that money. There is $$2.5 trillion in the trust fund for Social Security.

No problem! There is a $$2.5 trillion asset base. The OASDI Trust Fund need only sell a few of these assets each year.

The interviewer with PBS never batted an eye. He did not say, “Don’t try to pull the wool over my eyes, sister. I wasn’t born yesterday.” Yes, he was, and the scam worked just as well yesterday as it does today.

She said: “We can pay those benefits way out.” How? By selling trust fund assets.

You know the old line from the financial world. “Sell!” “To whom?”

To sell an asset, there must be a market. Here is the punch line, taken directly from the 2009 Report of the Trustees: “Status of the Social Security and Medicare Programs.” (In a printout, this appears on page 4.)

The Department of the Treasury invests program revenues in special non-marketable securities of the U.S. Government on which a market rate of interest is credited. The trust funds represent the accumulated value, including interest, of all prior program annual surpluses and deficits, and provide automatic authority to pay benefits.

What, exactly, are “non-marketable securities”? They are IOU’s issued by the Treasury on behalf of the U.S. government. As I mentioned, these IOU’s are not recorded in the government’s on-budget account. The revenues that purchase these IOU’s are.

But wait! There’s more! Pay attention to these words: “on which a market rate of interest is credited.” The Treasury applies a market rate of interest to a non-marketable security. There is no such rate. The Treasury can make it up as it goes along.

So, the trust funds are filled with assets: non-marketable IOU’s from the government, issued to a government agency. The trust funds are treated as marketable assets. They are indeed marketable: to the Treasury. The bill is passed along to Congress whenever the trust fund sells any of these assets.

There are lots and lots of these IOU’s in the Social Security OASDI Trust Fund. No problem!

This is a scam. It is an accounting trick to deceive the public. Does it work? Better than Congress could have dreamed back in late 1968, when the change in accounting took place. (http://tinyurl.com/yeh5sm5)

According to the lady representing the special interest group promoting Social Security and Medicare, Judgment Day is a depleted trust fund. That will take place is 2040, give or take a couple of years. Politically, a date this far out is irrelevant. Congress has been playing kick the can on this issue for a generation. There is no sense of urgency by the public, so there is no sense of urgency in Congress.

Judgment Day is 2010, when the general fund must start paying for those cashed-in non-marketable assets.

Let’s see if Congress will kick the can some more. Let’s see if Congress passes hikes in the FICA tax rates in 2010, or extends the wage base that pays the tax beyond today’s $$106,800 limit. My guess: Congress will kick the can. The deficit will grow.

“HOW BAD IS IT?”

Those were Ed McMahon’s four words to Johnny Carson, decade after decade, setting up Carson’s punch line.

Here is the punch line — lines, actually — as delivered by the notoriously humorless trustees of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds.

The 2009 report begins: “The financial condition of the Social Security and Medicare programs remains challenging.” I worked on Capitol Hill as Ron Paul’s first research assistant back in 1976. The code word “challenging” means “politically unsolvable at the present time, so Congress will kick the can.”

To this assessment, add the first sentence in the Conclusion: “The financial difficulties facing Social Security and Medicare pose serious challenges.” What does “serious challenge” mean? Think of December 7, 1941, on board the U.S.S. Arizona. Imagine this sound: “Aye-oo-ga! Aye-oo-ga! Abandon ship! Abandon ship!”

We are assured that Social Security’s problem is merely difficult. (“Yellow alert! Yellow alert!”)

For Social Security, the reform options are relatively well understood but the choices are difficult.

The Social Security options are very well understood by Congress, but not the public. These options have been understood by Congress ever since 1983, when Reagan hiked FICA taxes.

The political choice was difficult in 1983, back when Reagan still thought he could balance the budget without vetoing spending bills sent up by Congress, which he usually signed into law. That was the year that the on-budget deficit hit $$200 billion, a year before my 1977 prediction that it would hit $$200 billion in 1984.

Reagan knew that red ink from the sale of Social Security Trust Fund assets back to the Treasury would push his on-budget budget even deeper into the red. He hiked FICA taxes to keep this from happening. Ever since then, Congress has played kick the can.

We ain’t seen nothin’ yet! The Conclusion concludes:

Medicare is a bigger challenge. Its cost growth can be contained without sacrificing quality of care only if health care cost growth more generally is contained. But despite the difficulties — indeed, because of the difficulties — it is essential that action be taken soon, particularly to control health care costs.

CONCLUSION

We are on board a replica of a 19th-century Mississippi paddle wheel steamboat. Nostalgia is always popular. The illusion of the good old days still sells. The engine is chugging faster and faster. The captain and crew decided long ago never to put the engine into reverse.

We are floating down the fiscal river of no return. We are moving faster and faster. Some of us can hear the falls ahead. The sound gets louder and louder. But our companions on board say, “Let’s party!” They head for the dining room. After that, they will head for the slot machines.

Americans respond favorably to these words: “Free” and “all you can eat.” That is what politicians promise.

Either the falls will get us (deflationary depression) or else an explosion of the overheated engine will (hyperinflation).

Our companions are still in the dining room or heading toward the slot machines. You and I should begin to move toward the lifeboats.

370250,"Aristotle’s remarks in his Politics struck me as quaint and almost silly when I first read them in college: The statesman or legislator must mold his subjects like a potter molding a vase (book 7, part 4), and must shape future citizens by prescribing their education, even down to what kind of music they should be taught (book 8, part 3). The goal of politics is to perfect virtue (book 7, part 1) according to the constitution (monarchy, aristocracy, democracy) that is best suited to the basic temperament of the citizens (book 3, part 7). At the time I laughed, thinking that the state was just an impartial referee. It caught criminals and fought our enemies. Boy, was I wrong, on both counts: The legislator of course is not an impartial referee, and the laws do shape citizens, down to their very character.

The American character

Coltishness, and not suspicion, is the typically American characteristic. Anyone who has traveled to the poorer parts of the world, or who has merely flipped through National Geographic for that matter, is familiar with that pinched, distrustful frown of those on the edge of life who want to know: Are you a threat or a benefit? We are different.

In 1989, a friend and I were walking through the village of Eisenach, visiting the birthplace of J.S. Bach, in what was then East Germany. Approaching us on the sidewalk in the distance was a young man: Smiling, swinging his arms, and bouncing up on his toes with each step. I turned to my friend and said, “Twenty dollars says this jackass is one of ours.” And so it was.

Our readiness to smile and wave, and our genial impulsiveness, may make us the butt of European jokes (famously: Otto von Bismarck‘s “God has a special providence for fools, drunkards, and Americans”), but at the same time they earn us a kind of admiring indulgence. Even when we are held in the very fist of power in a strange country, this character, this indulgence, are evident. Consider James Stewart, playing the American doctor Ben MacKenna (and Doris Day as his corn-fed, wholesome wife) in Hitchcock’s The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), dressing down a Moroccan police inspector at about 6:45 in this clip. He thinks that he can just state the truth and walk out! What a puppy! Or consider Patrick Swayze, playing the American doctor Max Lowe, getting up in the face of the Indian landlord who threatens to shut down his free clinic, in this clip from City of Joy (1992). Gawd, doctor, don’t you know this man can crush you like a bug? Hundreds of examples like this could be provided, starting from Twain’s The Innocents Abroad.

The point of these foreign comparisons is not for contrast-gaining against other nationalities, but to better illustrate ourselves. As Santayana says, travel forces philosophical reconsideration upon us. The contrast can provide a present-day direct reference for bringing our national character into focus.

Another, indirect, way to do this is to compare ourselves to the past. Look into the faces of these merchants from the dawn of capitalism: Drer’s merchant Oswolt Krel; Holbein’s merchant Georg Gisze; Gossaert’s merchant; Petrus Christus’ goldsmith; and finally Jacques Coeur. There is a ferocious caution in the eyes of these men, any of whom could have been crushed and their wealth confiscated at any time, given the precarious status of property at the time. Especially poignant is the story of Jacques Coeur, whose financial genius and fortune held fifteenth century France together until he was destroyed by the envious courtiers of Charles VII. (And where is the historical novel telling his story? And — up until a few years ago at least — where was his biography? Lost in that great chronicle of neurotic kings and bloodthirsty warriors.) Now, compare those faces with these portraits in the Great Hall of the New York Chamber of Commerce. True, most of them are not the material of great biographies. But the very fact that they are commonplace and still exude the image of power and confidence in property is a testament to the triumph of capitalism not too many generations ago. Will this last? How many millionaires of today would think the title of “captain of industry” a sneer instead of an accolade? Or try this simple test: Draw up a list of the ten greatest biographies from the United States of 200 years ago and compare it to a similar list from the present. Is the moral seriousness of George Washington found in any man alive today? Does the character of Huck Finn still live in us?

And more to the point of our discussion here, what the heck do the laws have to do with it?

The shaping power of the law: direct power is unnecessary

The “general and permanent” laws of the federal government that are codified as positive law are a subset of the 50 “titles” of the U.S. Code. And this Code is a subset of the entire chronological list of laws, staggeringly enumerated in the United States Statutes at Large. In addition to these, and just as valid, are the rules issued by the agencies of the federal government, collected in the Federal Register, which is over 80,000 pages in length. Naturally, laws and rules often overlap, most conspicuously in the Tax Code, which may be over nine million words, though nobody knows for sure. In none of this is there any statement so bald and indiscreet as to suggest that you and your goods are owned by the state. But some threat of force must stand behind all these myriad laws and rules.

Examples of jackbooted use of force by the police at every level of government are depressingly abundant on the Internet, and victims do find their activity and very likely their characters “shaped” by this encounter. But such ham-fisted methods are otiose when the IRS, at the direction of any official, can reinterpret the rules to threaten your property, or when routine encounters with the police result in preemptive “takings” of your property. Examples of the former: The Western Journalism Center, whose tax-exempt status was threatened after its criticisms of the Clinton administration; Paula Jones, who was audited after revealing Clinton’s assault on her in 1997; Katherine Prudhomme, who faced an IRS audit after embarrassing Gore and Clinton at a town hall meeting in 2000; the NAACP, whose tax-exempt status was threatened when its Chairman Julian Bond criticized George Bush in 2004 — not to mention the master in using this tool, Dick Nixon. The stress of these threats are sometimes enough to drive their victims to suicide: For example, Bruce Barron, Mitch Snyder, Denise J. Simon, and Finn Caspersen. As for “takings,” consider the IRS’s power of jeopardy assessment, or more generally, see Richard A. Epstein‘s eponymous book.

Considering this caprice in the devastating application of law that sometimes its own functionaries do not understand, it is no wonder that the IRS is the most feared apparatus of the state.

The shaping power of “social engineering”

“Social engineering” often means government manipulation of public education, not to impart knowledge, but to shape the attitudes of children. Sheldon Richman’s Separating School and State and others give ample evidence of that, as do the originators of the phrase, Josef Stalin and Deng Xiaopeng. Here we begin to approach the modern version of Aristotle’s “legislator as demiurge.” The freely admitted purpose of shaping attitudes for democracy by the AFT, by the NEA, and by other teachers’ unions, which are all very much agencies of the state, not just because of their union power but because they make up a good block of all delegates to the conventions of the two largest political parties, sound very much like Trotsky’s ranting for the “New Socialist Man,” when he proclaimed that under his system “the average human type will rise to the heights of an Aristotle, a Goethe, or a Marx.”

The most critical tool for “shaping” mass democracies

Subtler than the foregoing in molding the very personalities of citizens of mass democracies is the division of “public” and “private” morality, a tool which works in three ways.

When I raised questions (swiped from Henry Hazlitt’s The Failure of the New Economics) in my first “macroeconomics” class in college, I saw how most students became bored or indifferent to the entire subject of economics because it made a frontal assault on their common sense. So, you’ve been taught that thrift is virtuous? Sorry — doesn’t apply here. You think that government indebtedness is a vice? Sorry, that doesn’t work in this field. Often teachers of this new wisdom — starting with Keynes himself — made a point of ridiculing those who espoused such bourgeois views. In nearly every other field, your common sense is fundamental to crossing the bridge from ignorance to knowledge. But not in the science that is most critical to the defense of freedom. Conversely, it is its basis in common sense that makes Austrian economics such a breath of fresh air to those who are jealous of their freedoms.

In the first application of this tool, the division of public and private morality enrolls all those adolescent dreamers as patriot arms of the state. Those who are willing to submerge their “private” sense of morality to the needs of the state create the pilots to firebomb cities, the killers to do “black ops” for the CIA, and the personalities like Gordon Liddy, who admitted he would have had no problem murdering journalist Jack Anderson, who was an inconvenience to the Nixon administration. Such people are not like those who espouse the “Auschwitz prison guard excuse” of “just following orders.” They are different in that they feel a mystic union of themselves with the power of the state. Typical of them are the (largely male) readers of Tom Clancy novels, whose (unintentionally) hilarious plots feature one man’s ability to single-handedly turn an entire bureaucracy to do right, as he dreams it to be.

In the second way, the division of public and private morality cuts off the natural ascent of men of virtue into public office. Under this division, holders of high office do not have the conspicuous integrity and honesty that mark a community leader — traits which Aristotle specifically emphasizes for his contention that politics is the culmination of ethics. They are Kennedy’s “best and the brightest,” those who know better than the rest; they are the Charlie Wilsons who steal tax dollars to arm the mujahedeen because they know what’s “right for America.” The addiction to womanizing so common among this caste is not so much a forgivable failing that should not greatly interest us, as an expression of their aloofness from conventional rules of behavior.

Finally, through this ethical bifurcation the virtue of tolerance is elevated above all others in order to prevent arguing our deepest convictions in the public forum. Those convictions are forced into the status of belief, which “tolerance” places off-limits to debate, when they should be forced into the status of principles, which should be subject to the most public and vigorous debate. Thus a principled man like Ron Paul is made to seem like a religious crank. Thus the courteous argumentation that builds mutual respect and a common passion for the truth never takes place. Tolerance so-called creates a “truth” for your gated community, and another one for mine. It directly defies any imperative to will your standard of right and wrong as a universal law.

All of the minutia of controlling education and the arts — Aristotle’s dreams for soul-shaping curricula, like all dreams of this ilk, including Plato’s eugenics for the benefit of the state, and Tommaso Campanella’s soul-shaping art in The City of the Sun — are swept aside by this thrifty dichotomy. As long as morality is private, all art becomes purely decorative. A preference for Vladimir Tendryakov is no better than one for Chuck Palahniuk; Dali is no better than Andres Serrano; Aristide Maillol is no better than Joseph Beuys. Any serious discussion of their merits would put the (bourgeois and commonsensical) individual mind on equal footing with “experts” in the state-sanctioned universities. With a strategic investment in education and patronage that equivocate real merit, resorting to detailed, hard-to-enforce prescriptions is unnecessary. The simple linchpin idea, based on a misconception of tolerance, is etched repeatedly in the mind by nearly every TV show, movie, and novel.

The last refinement in the lawgiver’s shaping of the soul

When Charlton Heston gave an address to the NRA on December 7, 1997, he conducted an interesting thought experiment. He first innocently asked how many own a gun. Then he paused and asked how many did own a gun, but thought better of revealing this in public. He drew an eloquent lesson:

You have been assaulted and robbed of the courage of your own convictions. Your pride in who you are, and what you believe, has been ridiculed, ransacked, and plundered. It may be a war without bullet[s] or bloodshed, but there is just as much liberty lost: You and your country are less free.

The application of the law in, say, a speeding ticket, is fairly random. Not all speeders are ticketed, and some very minor speeding offenses are. But the law which forces the driver to be alert to the possibility of such a ticket is very different from laws which are multitudinous and which intrude on behavior formerly regulated by custom and convention. Is there a working man anywhere in a modern democracy who doesn’t know that one politically incorrect word to the wrong woman in the workplace can get him sued? Because the law stands athwart an area that used to be monitored by mores and ordinary courtesy, it enforces a self-monitoring in its subject citizens, who must be alert to the many directions from which countless ill-defined laws may strike. No forced, government-mandated implant in the brain is necessary: The subject citizen, without firing a shot in opposition, without murmuring a word in public debate, is unconsciously enslaved by his own will. Our public faces may not yet be unconsciously stamped by the Deutsche Blick of several generations ago, but in a very significant way we have already lost many freedoms, which no radio talk show blather can recover.

What is the tool for withdrawal?

In a nation where government exacted about 5% in import taxes, when laws were clear and few and aspired to be the culmination of common-sense notions of right and wrong, the customary shapers of our character ruled: Our parents, our teachers, our literature, music, and sports. This is no longer the case. We are no longer the free people who are unafraid to speak up for the right, who are jealous of our freedoms.

Violent self-defense is a reflexive response to tyranny. But even if an exasperated citizenry were forced to this legitimate last recourse, it may very well fail to undo the insidious influence of the laws as described above. Also, a violent response is a frontal assault against the state’s greatest point of strength. To illustrate: Many of the swelling ranks of the domestic armies will be Iraq-Afghanistan veterans. They have returned, miffed that they couldn’t get their hands on America’s enemies; but now you’re here: surly, uncooperative, with a family in tow. Who’s gonna win that one? Violence is a tar baby: It will further entangle you in a system that knows the language of violence very well. Furthermore, it’s unnecessary.

tienne de La Botie, the philosopher of the nonviolence of Gandhi and Martin Luther King, clearly demonstrated that all governments, no matter how brutally in control they may be, must have the support of their subject citizens to stay in power. All that is required to topple them is to simply withdraw that support. The key question is: What twenty-first century tools will make this happen, tools which are just as effective as nonviolent confrontation was in the last century?

The limitations of voluntaryism

One response contends that almost any peaceful civic activity, such as voting, is almost as counterproductive as violence. It says that there is little that we can do to improve public matters, that, like Voltaire’s Candide, we can only “cultivate our garden.” This is also the response of “voluntaryism.” It holds that all coercion, especially that of the state, is immoral, and that we must withdraw our support. Yes, certainly, but how specifically? Voluntaryist John A. Pugsley provided a list of 15 ways to withdraw support from the state. Among the more practical of these suggestions: Don’t buy government debt, (legitimately) avoid taxes, create or at least patronize alternatives to government services like the post office, and educate by personal example. Others seem very problematic: Don’t patronize businesses which have contracts with the government, don’t use public libraries, engage in civil disobedience, and become an expatriate. In spite of this, Pugsley’s voluntaryist article is at least right in asking the absolutely critical question: What specifically are the tools for withdrawal of support from the state?

Conversely, one might arrange it so that the government doesn’t want the support of people like you. Do the equivalent of a union shop slowdown: Courteously obey the laws with the intent to turn the laws against themselves. Always drive 10 miles per hour below the speed limit. (You can leave early and listen to Murray Rothbard on audio tape or get him on iTunes.) Make the traffic cameras an expense to the state, instead of a cash cow. Go as slowly as possible through airport security (“Gosh, five times through the scanner, and it was that darned money clip!”). Send 10 pages of useless documents with your census report and give a muddled reply to every question.

But the foregoing highlights the weakness of voluntaryism: It is essentially peevishness, orneriness. And it will stay that way until we discover a tool for withdrawal of support that will be as effective as nonviolent confrontation.

The tool within the self

Lila Rajiva describes five responses of intellectual self-defense that are a kind of jujitsu, a side-stepping of those charging at you with ill intent. While she doesn’t describe her approach as a philosophy, it certainly does rest on a consistent general outlook, and it is not at all voluntaryist.

A reconsideration of how we are to mold our own characters is the best antidote against the state’s insidious efforts to do so. This approach must avoid the doctrinaire aspects of voluntaryism, which not only would keep you out of the public libraries but would preclude any effort to promote Ron Paul or anyone like him in the public arena. This begins with a principle of non-activity: Our resources are limited, and most activity will only entangle you in the institutional web of defeat. I am thinking of the wu-wei of Daoism. But if you like, find your first principle in the prohairesis of Epictetus: Nothing can truly disturb you except that you will your assent to it; and for the most part this assent is not given; it is not acting.

In any case, think that you carry with you a small crowbar: What can you possibly do against the armor of the state? For the most part, nothing. But your apparent lassitude protects a vigilant mind that will one day see the crack in this hardened armor. The opportunity will come naturally, effortlessly. And you will know how to pry it apart.

How is that applied, specifically? Not by wasting time and resources in unfocused activity, but by working only the chinks in the armor. Stand fast in “the thicket of the law” while we still have a remnant: Support groups like the Oath Keepers, who instill an awareness of the Constitution in those who wield the force of the state; the Second Amendment Foundation; the Internet Freedom Coalition; the Center for Constitutional Rights. Or think how an inexpensive seed will grow to split concrete: Give to open one student’s eyes through Birthright Unplugged.

Again, what is the tool for withdrawal?

“But look!” you say. “See how you yourself have been molded by the very laws you complain of! I don’t want to be like that — I don’t want to hide myself, I want to say out loud that congressman Blodgett is an ass. I want to get up in the face of the clerk frisking me at the airport. I won’t back down!”

That is exactly what we all aim for. We are not about to give away the coltish, impulsive, brave character that is our birthright as Americans. But: It is a long-term project. It is a project that fails if it stops at some kind of stoic conditioning of the self. But we do not yet know the tool that will make this a civic, a public, project. I hope that it may be you, or someone like you, who, while standing in line to check out groceries, or while driving to work, suddenly discovers it. — It will be so simple that everyone will wonder how they never saw it.

222370,"Recently by Richard Russell: What's the ‘Big Money’ Doing?

You and I are witnessing perhaps the greatest bubble in world financial history. And yes, it’s the amazing American credit bubble. Honestly, no one knows exactly how large this credit bubble is. We have already run up a national debt of roughly $$16.432 trillion. Further, we have unfunded future liabilities of anywhere from $$50 trillion to $$100 trillion (I have seen estimates of both figures  Niall Ferguson claims our unfunded liabilities are $$238 trillion). I’m afraid the gigantic credit bubble is doomed to topple over and splatter. It will burst when the credit of the United States is no longer accepted by our creditors.

The US will never default on its debts. That would be an unthinkable admission of sovereign bankruptcy. No, the US will, and is, following a different and time-tested method. The US will devalue the dollar, and thus attempt to pay off its debts with billions of devalued “mini-dollars.” Of course, this is a form of subtle, legal robbery.

Suppose you just borrowed a thousand dollars from a friend to be paid off in the year 2030. In 2030 you pay off your debt in devalued “mini-dollars.” Your friend screams, “This is thievery  what the hell are you giving me? I can’t use this junk!” You smile and say, “C’mon, I borrowed a thousand dollars from you, and I’m paying off my debt with a thousand newly-minted dollars, just as I promised you. I paid you off, so what are you squawking about?” Thus ends our friendship.

Now, on to gold.

1974 to  2001  50.8% 2002  24.8% 2003  19.5% 2004  5.35% 2005  17.77% 2006  18.36% 2007  32.34% 2008  5.14% 2009  24.3% 2010  29.8% 2011  14.2% 2012  9.6%

Do you see those percentages up there in that column? Do you know what they mean? They represent the year after year loss of purchasing power in Federal Reserve notes (“dollars”) in terms of gold. You may not have noticed the loss of purchasing power in the dollars that you earn and own, because the annual loss has been subtle and gradual. The above are official figures. Actually, I remember buying one-ounce gold coins in 1974 for $$70 a piece. Based on that price, that’s a multiple for gold of 23.9 from 1974 to the present.

By the way, during the last decade you would have made little holding the S&P 500, which is why investors bitterly call it “the lost decade”.

But if you’re as old as I am, you may remember what prices were back in the year 1946. For instance, I remember new Ford autos at a price of $$450.00. I remember the fare on the New York subways and busses at a nickel. I remember the cost of a ferry from Manhattan to New Jersey at a nickel. I remember the daily New York Times at 3 cents. I remember buying a good meal at the Automat in NYC for 35 cents. I remember a loaf of bread for a dime. I remember a double-scoop ice cream cone for five cents. I remember the Sunday Daily News at a nickel. I remember a ticket to a Broadway show for a $$1.10.

Yes, and I remember working for now-deceased Postal Telegraph Co. for twenty-five cents a day. And I remember loading trucks five days a week (including half-a-day Saturday) for $$18.75 a week, and that was a union job.

Meanwhile, subscribers get nervous when the price of an ounce of gold declines from 17.50 to 16.50. But you shouldn’t be nervous, because we’re dealing with a long-term story of steady devaluation. It’s the story of the US owning the world’s reserve currency, and as far as our creditors are concerned, the dollar has been “as good as gold.” Well, until it isn’t.

Near term problem  minutes of the Fed revealed that certain voting members of the Fed are worried that the Fed is being too free with its output of currency. This has scared some short-term, in-and-out gold-holders, who are afraid that the Fed is going to press the brakes down on its money-creation spigots. But that’s a short-term situation. The really big picture is the steady ongoing devaluation of our currency. That will continue, and it’s bearish long term for the dollar and bullish long-term for gold.

Let’s say that you’re a Communist big-wheel in China, and you are in charge of China’s sovereign reserves. You are aware that China holds well over a trillion dollars worth of US Treasury bonds and dollars. Then you are surely aware of the parade of percentages that I have posted in the column above. And you are also well aware of the US’s debts and deficits. And surely, you know that the US has additional trillions of dollars in unfunded liabilities.

So yes, Mr. Communist, you are well aware of all this. And you know that the US is never going to default on its debts. But wait, you know something else. You know that the US has a long-held habit of printing itself out of its debts. You know that Uncle Sam, by creating new trillions of Federal Reserve notes, is systematically devaluing our currency. And lastly, you know that your nation’s sovereign reserves are bulging with items denominated in Federal Reserve notes.

OK, you know the whole crazy story. So what are you going to do about it? The answer is obvious, you are going to swap your Federal Reserve notes for gold and other currencies. But you have to do your swapping carefully, lest you run up the price of gold and euros and Swiss francs.

BEIJINGu2014Fresh data suggest China is moderating its appetite for investing in U.S. securities, a trend that could mean lower flows of cheap capital from Beijing and a possible rise in borrowing costs across the American economy. An analysis of U.S. Treasury data suggests China, with $$3.2 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves, has begun to rapidly diversify its currencies portfolio.

“It clearly indicates China’s intention not to put all its eggs in one basket,” said Lu Feng, director of Peking University’s China Macroeconomic Research Center.

Below  weekly gold  the little flag at the far right of the chart should break out to the upside.

Edward Snowden. Julian Assange. Chelsea (née Bradley) Manning. Barrett Brown? If you are unfamiliar with the last name, you aren’t alone. Brown is just another invisible victim of our metastatic police state, facing a life in prison for undefined crimes.

Brown is a journalist and self-appointed spokesman for the cyber collective “Anonymous”, the group that has tried to expose government and corporate crimes. Many of them are young men aware of the dangers posed by an unlimited government spy system, and they loosely collaborate to confound and disrupt those systems. In September 2012, Brown was arrested for crimes ranging from “identity theft” to “threatening an officer”. The nature of those “crimes” range from the fact that he linked to a website where hundreds of credit card details were stored, a YouTube video where he threatens to expose the misdeeds a law enforcement official, and the fact that he brought attention through his writing to a huge cache of documents “stolen” from the company Stratfor. He faces 17 counts for crimes such as obstruction of justice to identity fraud, and a 110 year prison sentence.

His main “crime” appears to be that he exposed an FBI “sting” against fellow dissident Assange before the FBI could entrap him.

He faces additional charges if he speaks out publicly about his case- the Federal judge in charge has forbidden him from speaking out about the details of his arrest, incarceration and possible (probable?) imprisonment. This “gag ruling” was issued last week because the judge ruled that he was using the media to defend himself! Thankfully Alexander Zaitchik of Rolling Stone spoke with him at length before the gag order was issued, and his article is at the link.

This case against a journalist should scare anyone who posts information critical of the government.

Here is a link to a recent short history of Brown-

These rounds are apparently denser than steel (and are thus great as armor-piercing rounds) and also apparently explode on impact (whether this is due to the fact that they are made of depleted uranium, or because they are incendiary rounds, has not been clearly reported). In addition, they are also quite radioactive and thus poisonous to human life.

To date, newspaper stories have focused on the ""syndromes"" associated with the Balkan intervention. It turns out that soldiers are turning up sick, apparently because of exposure to depleted uranium. Thankfully, the soldiers are from a variety of nations, so no one monopoly state has been able to censor all the stories.

More to the point, Robert Fisk, writing in the Independent (UK) has pointed out that soldiers are not the only ones getting sick.

It turns out that those Albanians that NATO and Bill Clinton were so trigger-happy to ""save"" are now coming down with cancer.

Thanks to America’s ""glorious"" and ongoing war on Iraq, many Iraqis are also now suffering from similar cases of radiation poisoning. And so are American veterans.

The point which should not be lost on the aging hippie crowd — or on the younger generations — is that Western thought has not advanced since Vietnam.

Madeleine Albright has declared that the death of many thousands of Iraqi children is ""worth it"" to keep Saddam Hussein in check.

Albright and the other Clinton ""experts"" have no end game — no concept of what Iraq should look like in ten years. What sort of feelings do these policy wonks — who will now be celebrated by the press as departed heroes rather than war criminals — think will be the feelings of today’s Iraqi children when they are older? What do they imagine to be the feelings toward the West and the United States held by those Iraqi parents who have watched their children die?

And how about the Albanians? Did Nato and the USA have to poison them to, in order to ""save"" them?

For those who have not yet perceived Bill Clinton’s modus operandi — his style — Kosovo’s cancer cluster is par for the course.

Rather than actually do something good or useful, Clinton’s foray into Kosovo — which was closely linked to his need to push the Lewinsky sex scandal off the front pages — was merely aimed at making good headlines. (It might be argued that Clinton was also saving the credibility of the sycophants in the media, saving them the trouble of defending his libido any further, but that is beyond the scope of this article.)

Journalists and special interest groups crying out for President Happy-Pants to ""do something"" about Kosovo? Bombs away. Problem solved.

Only the problem was never solved.

Despite the heroic crowing by the left-wing establishment that ground troops had not been needed, and that Kosovo had not turned into ""another Vietnam,"" it turns out that Kosovo is indeed ""another Vietnam,"" although not for the reason feared.

Rather than turning into a charnel house where bright, young American men were shot, burned, maimed, blown up, and generally treated worse than hamburger meat, Kosovo turned out to be like Vietnam in demonstrating the left-wing establishment’s complete disregard for the alleged ""victims.""

Those Kosovars that we were supposedly ""saving"" are now coming down with cancer, thanks to us.

We must destroy the village in order to save it. Hello, Vietnam.

One final note: consider the fact that the government cares more about hamburger meat than it does about its citizens. The past few years have featured numerous media tales of tainted hamburger meat, such that the federal government is now pushing for all sorts of additional restrictions on how meat is slaughtered, packaged, shipped, labeled, and prepared. Hamburger meat, then, is something which requires great care.

Contrast this with the government’s utter disdain for its citizens’ lives, in particular those who are soldiers. Rather than adequately equip or train the military, America’s social workers in camo are sent to known terrorist havens, such as Yemen, where they can be blown up having lunch. Just as shamefully, they are sent to the Balkans, or Iraq, where they are poisoned by their own ammunition and experimental vaccinations. To top it all off, their ""superiors"" lie to them, lie to their families, and lie to the world, all in an effort to keep their jobs, which pay much more than a soldier earns. How noble.

I want to look at two words that the State and its hangers-on have employed with much success on behalf of increases in government power. One is racism. The other is equality.

What exactly is racism? We almost never hear a definition. I doubt anyone really knows what it is. If you’re inclined to dispute this, ask yourself why, if racism truly is something clear and determinate, there is such ceaseless disagreement over which thoughts and behaviors are racist and which are not?

If put on the spot, the average person would probably define racism along the lines of how Murray N. Rothbard defined anti-Semitism, involving hatred and/or the intention to carry out violence, whether State-directed or otherwise, against the despised group: Against the State: An ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr. Best Price: $$5.76 Buy New $$9.95 (as of 05:15 EST - Details)

It seems to me that there are only two supportable and defensible definitions of anti-Semitism: one, focusing on the subjective mental state of the person, and the other “objectively,” on the actions he undertakes or the policies he advocates. For the first, the best definition of anti-Semitism is simple and conclusive: a person who hates all Jews….

How, unless we are someone’s close friend, or shrink, can we know what lies in a person’s heart? Perhaps then the focus should be, not on the subject’s state of heart or mind, but on a proposition that can be checked by observers who don’t know the man personally. In that case, we should focus on the objective rather than the subjective, that is the person’s actions or advocacies. Well, in that case, the only rational definition of an anti-Semite is one who advocates political, legal, economic, or social disabilities to be levied against Jews (or, of course, has participated in imposing them).

This, then, seems reasonable: (1) someone is a racist if he hates a particular racial group, but (2) since we can’t read people’s minds, and since accusing people of hating an entire group of people is a fairly serious charge, instead of vainly trying to read the suspect’s mind we ought instead to see if he favors special disabilities against the group in question.

Back to Rothbard:

But am I not redefining anti-Semitism out of existence? Certainly not. On the subjective definition, by the very nature of the situation, I don’t know any such people, and I doubt whether the Smear Bund does either. On the objective definition, where outsiders can have greater knowledge, and setting aside clear-cut anti-Semites of the past, there are in modern America authentic anti-Semites: groups such as the Christian Identity movement, or the Aryan Resistance, or the author of the novel Turner’s Diaries. But these are marginal groups, you say, of no account and not worth worrying about? Yes, fella, and that is precisely the point.

On the other hand, maybe a racist is someone who believes different groups tend to have common characteristics, even while acknowledging the axiomatic point that each individual person is unique. But whether it’s family structure, a penchant for alcoholism, a reputation for hard work, or a great many other qualities, Thomas Sowell has assembled a vast body of work showing that these traits are not even close to being distributed equally across populations.

The Chinese, for example, gained reputations in countries all over the world for working very hard, often under especially difficult conditions. (As a matter of fact, this is one of the reasons American labor unions despised Chinese workers in the nineteenth century.) By the mid-20th century, the Chinese minority dominated major sectors of the Malaysian economy even though they were officially discriminated against in the Malaysian constitution, and earned twice the income of the average Malay. They owned the vast majority of the rice mills in Thailand and the Philippines. They conducted more than 70 percent of the retail trade in Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, the Philippines, and Malaysia.

We could tell a similar story about Armenians in various parts of the world, as well as Jews and East Indians. Japanese-Americans went from being so badly discriminated against that they were confined to camps during World War II to equaling whites in income by 1959 and exceeding whites in income a decade later by one-third.

Likewise for Germans, whose reputations and accomplishments in craftsmanship, science, and technology have been evident not only in Germany but also among Germans in the U.S., Brazil, Australia, Czechoslovakia, and Chile. They had more prosperous farms than Brazilian farmers in Brazil, Russian farmers in Russia, and Chilean farmers in Chile.

Jews earn higher incomes than Hispanics in the US; this, we are solemnly told, is the result of discrimination. Oh, really? As Sowell points out, how then are we to explain why Jews earn higher incomes than Hispanics in Hispanic countries?

According to the inane rules governing American society, Sowell, being black himself, is permitted to discuss such phenomena, while the rest of us face demonization, destroyed careers, and ruined reputations should we make note of any of this forbidden testimony.

In order not to be suspected of racism, therefore, one must play it as safe as possible by at least pretending to believe the following propositions:

— income disparities among groups are explainable entirely or in very large part by discrimination; — if a minority group is “underrepresented” in a particular profession, the cause must be racism; — if minority students are disproportionately disciplined in school, the cause must be racism, even when the teachers involved themselves belong to the same minority group; — if test scores – both in school and in the private sector – differ by racial group, this is evidence that the tests are culturally biased, even though the questions showing the greatest disparity happen to have the least cultural content. American Contempt for ... Walter E. Williams Best Price: $$8.00 Buy New $$13.11 (as of 04:15 EST - Details)

Not one of these statements is defensible, needless to say, but every one of them must be believed. Skeptics are, of course, racist.

The following opinions or propositions have all been declared racist at one point or another, by one source or another:

— affirmative action is undesirable; — antidiscrimination law is a violation of private property rights and freedom of contract; — Brown v. Board of Education was based on faulty reasoning; — the extent of racism in American society is exaggerated.

There are many grounds on which one could advance these claims. But since according to popular left-wing sites like Daily Kos, ThinkProgress, and Media Matters it is racist to believe in any of them, it doesn’t matter what your arguments are. You are a racist. Protest all you like, but the more you try, the more the commissars smear and ridicule you. You may pretend that you have logically sound and morally unimpeachable reasons for your views, but this is all a smokescreen for racism as far as the commissars are concerned. The only way you can satisfy them now is by abandoning your views (and even then they’ll still question your sincerity), even though you do not hold them on disreputable grounds.

Thus charges of racism nearly always involve attempted mind reading – e.g., that person claims to oppose antidiscrimination law out of some kind of principle, but we know it’s because he’s a racist.

To see libertarians, who of course should know better, jumping on the thought-control bandwagon, or pretending that the whole issue is about the freedom to be a jerk, is extremely short-sighted and most unfortunate. The State uses the racism racket as justification for its further extension of power over education, employment, wealth redistribution, and a good deal else. Meanwhile, it silences critics of State violence with its magic, never-defined word racism, an accusation the critic has to spend the rest of his life trying to disprove, only to discover that the race hustlers will not lift the curse until he utterly abases himself and repudiates his entire philosophy.

If he tries to defend himself by protesting that he has close friends who belong to the group he is accused of hating, he’ll be ridiculed more than ever. Here’s Rothbard again:

I also want to embellish a point: All my life, I have heard anti-anti-Semites sneer at Gentiles who, defending themselves against the charge of anti-Semitism, protest that “some of my best friends are Jews.” This phrase is always sneered at, as if easy ridicule is a refutation of the argument. But it seems to me that ridicule is habitually used here, precisely because the argument is conclusive. If some of Mr. X’s best friends are indeed Jews, it is absurd and self-contradictory to claim that he is anti-Semitic. And that should be that.

It’s hard to argue with Rothbard here. If someone had been accused of disliking ground beef, but it could be shown that he very much enjoyed hamburgers and goulash, that would pretty much demolish the accusation, wouldn’t it?

I know no one who hates entire groups, and those people who do are in such a tiny minority that their organizations are equal parts lunatic and FBI informant. Likewise, I know no one who favors the use of official violence against particular groups.

We should want to treat people justly and with respect, of course. Any decent person feels that way. But how and why does “equality” enter the picture, except in the trivial and obvious libertarian sense that we should all equally refrain from aggression against one another?

The State likes nothing more than to declare war on drugs, or terrorism, or poverty, or “inequality.” The State loves “equality” as an organizing principle, because it can never be achieved. In the course of trying, the State acquires ever more power over ever more practices and institutions. Anyone who questions the premise of equality is hectored out of polite society. Quite a racket, this, and certainly no place for libertarians to be.

If it’s material equality we want, it would vanish the moment after we achieved it, as soon as people resumed their normal spending patterns and the goods and services offered by some people were more highly valued than those offered by others. If it’s “equality of opportunity,” then we would have to abolish the family, as so many socialist schemes have seriously contemplated, since conditions in the household play such an important role in children’s success.

Yes, of course we oppose the inequality that results from special State privilege enjoyed by certain people and groups. But the real issue there isn’t inequality per se, but justice and private property.

Even the old saw about equality in the eyes of God isn’t quite right. Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn, the Catholic classical liberal, noted that Judas, who betrayed Christ, was in no way the “equal” of St. John, the beloved disciple, and that the origins of “equality” lay in Lucifer’s urge to be the equal of Christ. He added:

Egalitarianism under the best circumstances becomes hypocrisy; if sincerely accepted and believed in, its menace is greater. Then all actual inequalities appear without exception to be unjust, immoral, intolerable. Hatred, unhappiness, tension, a general maladjustment is the result. The situation is even worse when brutal efforts are made to establish equality through a process of artificial leveling (‘social engineering’) which can only be done by force, restrictions, or terror, and the outcome is a complete loss of liberty.

If we want to be free, therefore, we must shun the State, its methods, and its language.

218896,"With tens, hundreds, of billions squandered, American men and women being killed by the day, not to speak of Iraqis, a country smashed and in ruins, an Islamic revolution threatening, and no end in sight to the unrelenting fiasco, the question becomes: just who is responsible for the disaster of the Iraq War?

I don’t mean which individuals. We know the answer to that question. As for Bush himself, he is so deluded about this war that he seems incapable of expressing anything resembling a truth about it. He is like a person who caused a 100-car pile up on a highway standing around claiming all is well. One doesn’t know whether to take the person to jail or the psychiatric ward.

War guilt addresses a broader question that historians and sometimes jurists like to ask: which government? Since war is generally considered an awful thing, it becomes crucially important to decide which country is finally responsible for its occurrence. It is a matter of justice, and important for trying to achieve peace on earth, that everyone understand which government is responsible.

We know the answer here too, but the war party is constantly trying to muddy the waters. The war party says that Saddam was uncooperative before the war, that he harbored WMDs, that he was itching for a war, and even George Bush said before the invasion that it was in Saddam’s power to stop a war if only he would comply with US demands. But was it really? Even if you believe that the US is granted some divine right to tell other countries what to do, could US ultimatums be taken seriously?

We’ve already seen how the WMD claim didn’t hold up. It is tough for Americans to admit it, but Saddam was telling the truth, and US leaders were not. It turns out that there is much more to the story. It seems that the Iraqi government did everything it could to avert a war, even aside from revealing all known details about its weapons’ programs in its accurate 12,000-page weapons declaration to the UN. It tried old-fashioned backdoor diplomatic maneuvers as well, further establishing that the issue of war guilt firmly lands on the US.

As has been widely reported, last March, as US troops gathered on Iraqi borders, Saddam sent a message to the Bush administration through Imad Hage, a Lebanese-American businessman, who had met with Saddam. It had first reached the office of the under secretary for planning and defense, in February. The message: Iraq has no WMDs, Saddam would permit US troops and experts to do a search of the country, and Saddam would even permit free elections — anything to avert a war. The same message was delivered in London a month later to Pentagon adviser Richard Perle.

In addition, the Iraqis were prepared to hand over a man being held in Baghdad on suspicion of involvement in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. They were ready to sign up in the US-led global war on terrorism. They were ready to offer “full support for any U.S. plan” in the Arab-Israeli peace process. It gets more astounding. Iraq was prepared to offer US companies “first priority as it relates to Iraq oil, mining rights.”

Maybe Iraq would not have followed through with all these promises, but the offer alone shows that Iraq wanted to make a deal, that it wanted to avert war. That is the crucial thing.

The list alone reveals another interesting component so far uncommented upon. As you go through the list of concessions — all now in the hands of Senate investigators — it seems that government leaders in Iraq, including Saddam himself, were as confused as anyone else was about the real reason the US was threatening war. Was it about terrorism? Ok, we’ll fight terrorism. Dictatorship? Ok, we’ll hold free elections. Iraqi support of the Palestinian cause? Ok, we’ll switch sides. WMDs? We would gladly dismantle them if we had them. Oil? You can have it.

The communications hit all the bases, just in case one of these reasons was the real reason for war. What we have here is a regime desperate to avert a war, ready to do anything and everything to stop destruction, invasion, mass death, and occupation. Moreover, members of the Iraqi regime must have been scratching their heads to figure out precisely what was really driving the Bush administration, and figured it was worth the effort to go all out for peace.

Was the communication credible? Mr. Hage was well connected and his method was consistent with old-time diplomatic standards in the Arab world. Those he contacted took it seriously. Those who have attempted to discredit Hage draw attention to the fact that he once tried to board an airline with a gun in his carry on. So what? This is a common occurrence in the South where people carry weapons all the time and sometimes forget to remove them before boarding.

Moreover, this turns out to be the final try made after a long line of attempts to communicate the anti-war message, after it became clear that Washington had every intention to go to war. The US response was mixed. There were signs of listening but also signs that such outreach was pointless.

Indeed it was. It was well known in the White House that Bush entered office with the purpose of getting Saddam, either because of a personal vendetta or because he believed he was called by God to dislodge Saddam from power, or both. Those who had a nose for subterfuge knew all along that the claims about Iraq and its compliance with UN mandates were nothing more than eyewash.

Many efforts will be made to discredit the flurry of stories that have belatedly covered these diplomatic overtures. The debate will involve every manner of partisanship and parsing. And yet, it was also increasingly clear to many of us during 2002 that nothing Iraq could do or would do was capable of averting the killing. It was a done deal.

Think of this. The US intended to go to war regardless of what the opposing country would or would not do. There is precedent of course — the US government has a long history of maneuvering itself into avoidable wars — but rarely has the hunger for war been more open or more voracious, more public and more aggressive.

Americans elected Bush because they thought he would cut government and pursue a humble foreign policy. When you read about the history of the war, in light of all these revelations, three points stand out. First, Bush is not the man people thought they were electing. Two, the Bush administration intended war all along and lied about it, and hence the war guilt rests with the US. Three, these are impeachable offenses by any constitutional standard.

Don’t tell me: I’m against aggressive war — the first crime in the indictment at Nuremberg — but this war was necessary. It was not necessary. If you are against aggressive war, you are against the Bush administration. What this suggests about the future is ominous. Something must be done to disarm the US, to bring the US state in compliance with widely accepted norms of conduct in international relations. It also means that no regime installed by the US in Iraq can ever have credibility.

Bush and the state he administers caused this pileup. Let justice be done.

739667,"James Bovard, the great libertarian champion of our freedom and civil liberties, recently shared with readers his mail from Bush supporters. For starters here are some of the salutations: ""communist bastard,"" ""asshole,"" ""a piece of trash, scum of the earth."" It goes downhill from there.

Bush’s supporters demand lock-step consensus that Bush is right. They regard truthful reports that Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction and was not involved in the September 11 attack on the US — truths now firmly established by the Bush administration’s own reports — as treasonous America-bashing.

As well, Bovard is interpreted as throwing cold water on the feel-good, macho, Muslim butt-kicking that Bush’s invasion of Iraq has come to symbolize for his supporters. ""People like you and Michael Moore,"" one irate reader wrote, ""is (sic) what brings down our country.""

I have received similar responses from conservatives, as, no doubt, have a number of other writers who object to a domestic police state at war with the world.

In language reeking with hatred, Heritage Foundation TownHall readers impolitely informed me that opposing the invasion of Iraq is identical to opposing America, that Bush is the greatest American leader in history and everyone who disagrees with him should be shot before they cause America to lose another war. TownHall’s readers were sufficiently frightening to convince the Heritage Foundation to stop posting my columns.

Bush’s conservative supporters want no debate. They want no facts, no analysis. They want to denounce and to demonize the enemies that the Hannitys, Limbaughs, and Savages of talk radio assure them are everywhere at work destroying their great and noble country.

I remember when conservatives favored restraint in foreign policy and wished to limit government power in order to protect civil liberties. Today’s young conservatives are Jacobins determined to use government power to impose their will at home and abroad.

Where did such ""conservatives"" come from?

Claes Ryn in his important book, America the Virtuous, explains the intellectual evolution of the neoconservatives who lead the Bush administration. For all their defects, however, neocons are thoughtful compared to the world of talk radio, whose inhabitants are trained to shout down everyone else. From whence came the brownshirt movement that slavishly adheres to the neocons’ agenda?

Three recent books address this question. Thomas Frank in What’s the Matter With Kansas, locates the movement in legitimate conservative resentments of people who feel that family, religious, and patriotic values are given short shrift by elitist liberals.

These resentments festered and multiplied as offshore production, jobs outsourcing, and immigration took a toll on careers and the American dream.

An audience was waiting for rightwing talk radio, which found its stride during the Clinton years. Clinton’s evasions made it easy to fall in with show hosts, who spun conspiracies and fabricated a false consciousness for listeners who became increasingly angry.

Show hosts, who advertise themselves as truth-tellers in a no-spin zone, quickly figured out that success depends upon constantly confronting listeners with bogymen to be exposed and denounced: war protesters and America-bashers, the French, marrying homosexuals, the liberal media, turncoats, Democrats, and the ACLU.

Talk radio’s ""news stories"" do not need to be true. Their importance lies in inflaming resentments and confirming that America’s implacable enemies are working resolutely to destroy us.

David Brock’s The Republican Noise Machine lacks the insights of Thomas Frank’s book, but it provides a gossipy history of the rightwing takeover of the US media. Brock is unfair to some people, myself included, and mischaracterizes as rightwing some media personalities who are under rightwing attack.

Brock is as blindly committed to his causes as the rightwing zealots he exposes are to theirs. Unlike Frank, he cannot acknowledge that the rightwing has legitimate issues.

Nevertheless, Brock makes a credible case that today’s conservatives are driven by ideology, not by fact. He argues that their stock in trade is denunciation, not debate. Conservatives don’t assess opponents’ arguments, they demonize opponents. Truth and falsity are out of the picture; the criteria are: who’s good, who’s evil, who’s patriotic, who’s unpatriotic.

These are the traits of brownshirts. Brownshirts know they are right. They know their opponents are wrong and regard them as enemies who must be silenced if not exterminated.

Some of Brock’s quotes from prominent conservative commentators will curl your toes. His description of the rightwing’s destruction of an independent media and the ""Fairness Doctrine"" explain why a recent CNN/Gallup poll found that 42% of Americans still believe that Saddam Hussein was involved in the September 11 terrorist attack on the US and 32% believe that Saddam Hussein personally planned the attack.

A country in which 42% of the population is totally misinformed is not a country where democracy is safe.

Today there is no one to correct a lie once it is told. The media, thanks to Republicans, has been concentrated in few hands, and they are not the hands of newsmen. Corporate values rule. If lies sell, sell them. If listeners, viewers, and readers want confirmation of their resentments and beliefs, give it to them. Objectivity turns listeners off and is a money loser.

In his book, Cruel and Unusual, Mark Crispin Miller, professor of media studies at New York University, explains how rightwing influence has moved the media away from reporting news to designing our consciousness. ""The Age of Information,"" Miller writes, ""has turned out to be an Age of Ignorance.""

Miller makes a strong case. His description of how CNN and Fox News destroyed the credibility of Scott Ritter, the leading expert on Iraq’s weapons, reveals a media completely given over to propaganda. Ritter stood in the way of the neocon’s invasion of Iraq.

CNN’s Miles O’Brien, Eason Jordan, Catherine Callaway, Paula Zahn, Kyra Phillips, Arthel Neville, and Fox News’ David Asman and John Gibson portrayed Ritter as a disloyal American, a Ba-athist stooge on the take from Saddam Hussein, and compared him to Jane Fonda in North Vietnam.

With this, the rightwing talk radio crazies were off and running. Anyone with the slightest bit of real information about the state of weapons development in Iraq was dismissed as a foreign agent who should be shot for treason.

By substituting fiction for reality, the US media took the country to war. The CNN and Fox News ""journalists"" are as responsible for America’s ill-fated invasion of Iraq as Cheney and Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Perle.

With a sizable percentage of the US population now addicted to daily confirmations of their resentments and hatreds, US policy will be increasingly driven by tightly made-up minds in pursuit of unrealistic agendas.

American troops are in Iraq on false pretenses. No one knows all the fateful consequences of this mistaken adventure. Bush’s reelection would be seen as a vindication of aggression, and more aggression would likely follow. A continuing expenditure of blood, money, alliances, good will, and civil liberties is not a future to which to look forward.

33441,"Last week I wrote an article and did an interview explaining that in my reading of the new Russia sanctions bill just signed by President Trump, there is a measure opening the door to a US government crackdown on some of the non-mainstream media. In particular, Section 221 of the “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act” would punish “persons” who are “engaging in transactions with the intelligence or defense sectors of the Government of the Russian Federation.”

At first one might think this is reading too much into the text, however as a twelve year Capitol Hill veteran bill-reader I can assure you that these bills are never written in a simple, expository manner. There is always a subtext, and in this case we must consider the numerous instances where the Director of Central Intelligence and other senior leadership in the US intelligence community have attempted to establish the idea that foreign news channels such as RT or Sputnik News are not First Amendment protected press, but rather tools of a foreign intelligence organization.

You can see in the current atmosphere, where anti-Russia hysteria has spread like typhoid, how readily-accepted such a notion would be by many. The reds are under our beds and the Russkies have taken over our airwaves.

I don’t think the crackdown will stop at Russian government funded news organizations like RT and Sputnik, however. Once the initial strike is made at the lowest hanging fruit, the second wave will target Russia-focused organizations not funded by governments but that challenge the official US government line that Russia is our number one enemy and its government must be overthrown. Popular private alternative websites like The Duran and Russia Insider will likely be next on the list for prosecution.

Time to buy old US gold coins

Sound farfetched? Think of it this way (I can assure you the neocons do): if the Russian government and RT are opposed to sanctions and you operate a website that also takes a line in opposition to Russia sanctions are you not doing the work of Russian intelligence? Are you not seeking to influence your readers in a manner that Russian intelligence would want? Are you not “engaging in transactions” even over the airwaves?

And after this second wave you can be sure there will be a push to move on other alternative media that has nothing to do with Russia but that opposes US interventionist foreign policy: ZeroHedge, Lew Rockwell, Ron Paul Institute, ConsortiumNews, etc.

Crazy, you say? Don’t forget: this war against us already started last year when the Washington Post ran a front page article accusing all of the above of being Russian agents!

What would be next? Do you read any of these alternative news sites? Do you pass along articles that oppose US sanctions policy toward Russia? You are engaging in transactions. You will be subject to “sanctions” as described in the “Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act,” which is now the law of the land.

This would never happen, you might say. The government would never compile, analyze, and target private news outlets just because they deviate from the official neocon Washington line.

Perhaps not yet. But some US government funded “non-governmental” organizations are already doing just that.

The German Marshall Fund has less to do with Germany these days than it did when founded after WWII as a show of appreciation for the US Marshall Fund. These days it’s mostly funded by the US government, allied governments (especially in the Russia-hating Baltics), neocon grant-making foundations, and the military-industrial complex. Through its strangely Soviet-sounding “Alliance for Securing Democracy” project it has launched something called “Hamilton 68: A New Tool to Track Russian Disinformation on Twitter.”

This project monitors 600 Twitter accounts that the German Marshall Fund claims are “accounts that are involved in promoting Russian influence and disinformation goals.” Which accounts does this monitor? It won’t tell us. How does it choose which ones to monitor? It won’t tell us. To what end? Frighteningly, it won’t tell us.

How ironic that something called the German Marshall Fund is bringing Stasi-like tactics to silence alternative media and opinions in the United States!

So what does the “Hamilton 68” project do? In its own words it firstly “shows tweets from official Russian propaganda outlets in English, and a short post discussing the themes of the day. This is Russia’s overt messaging.”

But it goes further than that. It tracks and stores information about others who have no connection to Russia but who “on their own initiative reliably repeat and amplify Russian themes.” This is what the German Marshall Fund calls a “network” of second tier disinformation distributors.

What does this “network” of people with no connection to Russia but who amplify Russian “themes” do?

It “reflects Russian messaging priorities, but that does not mean every name or link you see on the dashboard is pro-Russian. The network sometimes amplifies stories that Russia likes, or people with like-minded views but no formal connection to Russia.”

So, according to the self-proclaimed alliance for securing democracy you might not even know it when you are pushing Russian state propaganda!

Do you see what they are doing here? They are using US and other government money in an effort to eliminate any news organization or individual who deviates from the official neocon foreign policy line on Russia, Syria, Ukraine, etc. They are trying to eliminate any information that challenges the neocon line. To criminalize it.

In fact they admit that they are seeking to silence alternative viewpoints:

Our objective in providing this dashboard is to help ordinary people, journalists, and other analysts identify Russian messaging themes and detect active disinformation or attack campaigns as soon as they begin. Exposing these messages will make information consumers more resilient and reduce the effectiveness of Russia’s attempts to influence Americans’ thinking, and deter this activity in the future by making it less effective.

The very Soviet-sounding “Alliance for Securing Democracy” project description ends with a suitably authoritarian warning, ripped from the pages of 1984, Darkness at Noon, or Erich Honecker‘s “how-to” guide:

We are not telling you what to think, but we believe you should know when someone is trying to manipulate you. What you do with that information is up to you.

Chilling, no? And much of it is being done with your money by your government and in your name.

That is why the neocons and their myriad think tanks (government-funded in many cases) would like nothing more than to shut down our upcoming Peace and Prosperity 2017 Conference, to be held right at their front door! They cannot stand an open debate about Washington’s hyper-interventionist foreign policy. They don’t want to talk about all their failed wars — and they really don’t want to talk about the wars they have planned and are pushing.

We are not the anti-Americans. They are. They hate the First Amendment. They hate debate. They hate us.

How can we fight back? One very easy way is to show them a full house at our conference! Just by showing up you are poking a neocon in the eye.

Can you imagine how furious they were when last year’s Peace and Prosperity Conference was broadcast on CSPAN?

Thanks to the support of our very generous Host Committee we can keep the ticket price as low as possible. We want to see all of you there! You will get a full day of fantastic and insightful speakers, the opportunity to network and plot with like-minded individuals, and a very nice luncheon with plenty of coffee and tea to boot!

Double Standards in the Global War on Terror

Oh, the spectacle of it all — and don’t think I’m referring to those opening ceremonies in Beijing, where North Korean-style synchronization seemed to fuse with smiley-faced Walt Disney, or Michael Phelp’s thrilling hunt for eight gold medals and Speedo’s one million dollar “bonus,” a modernized tribute to the ancient Greek tradition of amateurism in action. No, I’m thinking of the blitz of media coverage after Dr. Bruce Ivins, who worked at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Maryland, committed suicide by Tylenol on July 29th and the FBI promptly accused him of the anthrax attacks of September and October 2001.

You remember them: the powder that, innocuously enough, arrived by envelope — giving going postal a new meaning — accompanied by hair-raising letters ominously dated “09-11-01” that said, “Death to America. Death to Israel. Allah is great.” Five Americans would die from anthrax inhalation and 17 would be injured. The Hart Senate Office Building, along with various postal facilities, would be shut down for months of clean-up, while media companies that received the envelopes were thrown into chaos.

For a nation already terrified by the attacks of September 11, 2001, the thought that a brutal dictator with weapons of mass destruction (who might even have turned the anthrax over to the terrorists) was ready to do us greater harm undoubtedly helped pave the way for an invasion of Iraq. The President would even claim that Saddam Hussein had the ability to send unmanned aerial vehicles to spray biological or chemical weapons over the east coast of the United States (drones that, like Saddam’s nuclear program, would turn out not to exist).

Today, it’s hard even to recall just how terrifying those anthrax attacks were. According to a LexisNexis search, between Oct. 4 and Dec. 4, 2001, 389 stories appeared in the New York Times with “anthrax” in the headline. In that same period, 238 such stories appeared in the Washington Post. That’s the news equivalent of an unending, high-pitched scream of horror — and from those attacks would emerge an American world of hysteria involving orange alerts and duct tape, smallpox vaccinations, and finally a war, lest any of this stuff, or anything faintly like it, fall into the hands of terrorists.

And yet, by the end of 2001, it had become clear that, despite the accompanying letters, the anthrax in those envelopes was from a domestically produced strain. It was neither from the backlands of Afghanistan nor from Baghdad, but — almost certainly — from our own military bio-weapons labs. At that point, the anthrax killings essentially vanished… Poof!… while 9/11 only gained traction as the singular event of our times.

Those deaths-by-anthrax ceased to be part of the administration’s developing Global War on Terror narrative, which was, of course, aimed at Islamist fanatics (and scads of countries that were said to provide them with “safe haven”), but certainly not military scientists here at home. No less quickly did those attacks drop from the front pages — in fact, simply from the pages — of the nation’s newspapers and off TV screens.

Unlike with 9/11, there would be no ritualistic reminders of the anniversaries of those attacks in years to come. No victims, or survivors, or relatives of victims would step to podiums and ring bells, or read names, or offer encomiums. There would be no billion-dollar (or even million-dollar) memorial to the anthrax dead for the survivors to argue over. There would be little but silence, while the FBI fumbled its misbegotten way through an investigative process largely focused on one U.S. bio-weapons scientist, Steven J. Hatfill, who also worked at Fort Detrick and just happened to be the wrong man. (Bruce Ivins, eerily enough, would work closely with, and aid, the FBI’s investigation for years until the spotlight of suspicion came to be directed at him.)

This essentially remained the state of the case until, as July ended, Ivins committed suicide. Then, what a field day! The details, the questions, the doubts, the disputed scientific evidence, the lists of kinds of drugs he was prescribed, the lurid quotes, the “rat’s nest” of an anthrax-contaminated lab he worked in, the strange emails and letters! (“I wish I could control the thoughts in my mind… I get incredible paranoid, delusional thoughts at times, and there’s nothing I can do until they go away, either by themselves or with drugs.”) Case solved! Or not… The “mad scientist” from the Army’s Fort Detrick bio-wars labs finally nabbed! Or not…

It was a dream of a story. And the mainstream media ran with it, knowledgeably, authoritatively, as if they had never let it go. Now, as the coverage fades and the story once again threatens to head for obscurity (despite doubts about Ivins’s role in the attacks), I thought it might be worth mentioning a few questions that came to my mind as I read through recent coverage — not on Ivins’s guilt or innocence, but on matters that are so much a part of our American landscape that normally no one even thinks to ask about them.

Here are my top six questions about the case:

1. Why wasn’t the Bush administration’s War on Terror modus operandi applied to the anthrax case?

On August 10th, William J. Broad and Scott Shane reported on some of the human costs of the FBI anthrax investigation in a front-page New York Times piece headlined, “For Suspects, Anthrax Case Had Big Costs, Scores of the Innocent in a Wide F.B.I. Net.” They did a fine job of establishing that those who serially came under suspicion had a tough time of it: “lost jobs, canceled visas, broken marriages, frayed friendships.” According to the Times (and others), under the pressure of FBI surveillance, several had their careers wrecked; most were interviewed and re-interviewed numerous times in a “heavy-handed” manner, as well as polygraphed; some were tailed and trailed, their homes searched, and their workplaces ransacked.

Under the pressure of FBI “interest,” anthrax specialist and “biodefense insider” Perry Mikesell evidently turned into an alcoholic and drank himself to death. Steven Hatfill, while his life was being turned inside out, had an agent trailing him in a car run over his foot, for which, Broad and Shane add, he, not the agent, was issued a ticket. And finally, of course, Dr. Ivins, growing ever more distressed and evidently ever less balanced, committed suicide on the day his lawyer was meeting with the FBI about a possible plea bargain that could have left him in jail for life, but would have taken the death penalty off the table.

Still, tough as life was for Mikesell, Hatfill, Ivins, and scores of others, here’s an observation that you’ll see nowhere else in a media that’s had a two-week romp through the case: In search of a confession, none of the suspects of these last years, including Ivins, ever had a lighted cigarette inserted in his ear; none of them were hit, spit on, kicked, and paraded naked; none were beaten to death while imprisoned but uncharged with a crime; none were doused with cold water and left naked in a cell on a freezing night; none were given electric shocks, hooded, shackled in painful “stress positions,” or sodomized; none were subjected to loud music, flashing lights, and denied sleep for days on end; none were smothered to death, or made to crawl naked across a jail floor in a dog collar, or menaced by guard dogs. None were ever waterboarded.

Whatever the pressure on Ivins or Hatfill, neither was kidnapped off a street near his house, stripped of his clothes, diapered, blindfolded, shackled, drugged, and “rendered” to the prisons of another country, possibly to be subjected to electric shocks or cut by scalpel by the torturers of a foreign regime. Even though each of the suspects in the anthrax murders was, at some point, believed to have been a terrorist who had committed a heinous crime with a weapon of mass destruction, none were ever declared “enemy combatants.” None were ever imprisoned without charges, or much hope of trial or release, in off-shore, secret, CIA-run “black sites.”

Why not?

2. Why wasn’t the U.S. military sent in?

Part of the reigning paradigm of the Bush years was this: police work was not enough when the homeland was threatened. The tracking down of terrorists who had killed or might someday kill Americans was a matter of “war.” Those who had attacked the American homeland and murdered U.S. citizens would, as our President put it, be “hunted down” by special ops forces and CIA agents who had been granted the right to assassinate and brought in “dead or alive.”

Why then, when acts of murderous bio-terror had been committed on American soil, was the military not called in? Why were no CIA “death squads” — the tellingly descriptive phrase used by Jane Mayer in her remarkable new book, The Dark Side — dispatched to assassinate likely suspects? Why were no Predator unmanned drones, armed with Hellfire missiles, launched to cruise the skies of Maryland and take out Ivins or other suspects “precisely” and “surgically” in their homes (whatever the “collateral damage”)? Why, in fact, weren’t their homes simply obliterated in the manner regularly employed in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, and elsewhere? (In fact, it seems to have taken the FBI two years after their first suspicions of Ivins simply to search his house and even longer finally to take away his high-level security clearance.)

Once U.S. weapons labs were identified as the sources of the anthrax, why were no special ops teams sent in to occupy the facilities, shut them down, and fly those found there, shackled and blindfolded, to Guantanamo or other more secret sites?

Why, when the administration went to great lengths to squeeze off funding for terrorists elsewhere, was funding for those labs significantly increased?

Why, when those swept up or simply kidnapped by the Bush administration and then discovered to be innocent, were — after secret imprisonment, abuse, and torture — regularly released without apology or reimbursement (if released at all), did the U.S. government pay Hatfill $$4.6 million to settle a lawsuit he filed in response to his ordeal?

Why when, according to the Vice President’s “one percent doctrine,” no response was too extreme if even a minuscule chance of a catastrophic attack against the U.S. “homeland” existed, were no extreme acts taken with a WMD killer (or killers) on the loose, possibly in Maryland’s suburbs?

3. Once the anthrax threat was identified as coming from U.S. military labs, why did the administration, the FBI, and the media assume that only a single individual was responsible?

Read as much of the coverage of the anthrax killings as you want and you’ll discover that the FBI has long taken for blanket fact that a single “mad scientist” was the culprit — and, no less important, that that theory has been accepted as bedrock fact by the media as well. No alternative possibilities have been seriously considered for years.

For instance, it is known that a set of the anthrax letters was sent from a mailbox in Princeton, New Jersey, some hours from Ivins’s home and the Fort Detrick lab in Frederick, Maryland. The question the FBI puzzled over — and the media took up vigorously — was whether, on the day in question, Ivins had time to make it to Princeton and back, given what’s known of his schedule. The FBI suggests that he did; critics suggest otherwise. No one, however, seems to consider the possibility that the lone terrorist of the anthrax killings might have had one or more accomplices, which would have made the “problem” of mailing those letters into a piece of cake.

Is it that Americans, as opposed to foreigners bent on terrorism, are assumed to be unstoppable individualists, loners canny enough to carry out plots by themselves? Does no one recall that the last great act of American terrorism in the United States, the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, was a crime committed by at least two American “loners”? (The earliest reports in that case, too, blamed Arab terrorists — plural.)

There seem to have been no serious al-Qaeda “sleeper cells” in this country, but how do we know that there isn’t a “sleeper cell” of American bio-killers lurking somewhere in the U.S. military lab community?

4. What of those military labs? Why does their history continue to play little or no part in the story of the anthrax attacks?

In reading through reams of coverage of Ivins’s suicide and the FBI case against him, I found only a single reference to the work his lab at Fort Detrick had been dedicated to throughout most of the Cold War era. Here is that sentence from the Washington Post: “As home to the Army Biological Warfare Laboratories, the facility ran a top-secret program producing offensive biological weapons from 1943 until 1969.” And yet, if you don’t grasp this fact, the real significance of the anthrax case remains in the shadows.

As with the continuing story of nuclear dangers on our planet, the terrors of our age are almost invariably portrayed as emerging from bands of fanatics, or lands like Iran said to be ruled by the same, in the backlands of our planet (some of which also just happen to be in the energy heartlands of the same planet). And yet, if we are terrified enough of loose or proliferating weapons of mass destruction to threaten or start wars over them, it’s important to understand that, from 1945 on, these dangers — and they are grim dangers — emerged from the heartland of the military-industrial machines of the two Cold War superpowers, the U.S. and the USSR.

Put another way, the most conceptually frightening attacks of 2001 came directly from the Cold War urge to develop offensive biological weapons. Until 1969, the Army’s biological-warfare laboratories at Fort Detrick were focused, in part, on that task. Plain and simple. After President Richard Nixon shut down the offensive bio-war program in 1969, the Army’s scientists switched to work on “defenses” against the same. As with defenses against nuclear attack, however, such work, by its nature, is often hard to separate from offensive work on such weaponry. In other words, looked at a certain way, one focus of the Fort Detrick lab, which fell under suspicion in the anthrax attacks by the winter of 2001, has long been putting bio-war on the global menu. In that, it was evidently successful in the end.

There is irony here, of course. In the post-Cold War era, our worries focused almost solely on the deteriorating, sometimes ill-guarded Russian Cold War labs and storehouses for biological, chemical, and nuclear war. It was long feared that, from them, such nightmares would drop into our world. But in this we were, it seems, wrong. The labs with the holes were ours and — what’s more terrifying — the possibilities for leakage and misuse are still expanding exponentially.

5. Were the anthrax attacks the less important ones of 2001?

If you compare the two sets of 2001 attacks in terms of death and destruction, 9/11 obviously leaves the anthrax attacks in the dust. Thought about a certain way, however, the attacks of 9/11, while bold, murderous, televisually spectacular, and apocalyptic looking, were conceptually old hat. It was the anthrax attacks that pointed the way to a new and frightening future.

After all, the World Trade Center had already been attacked, and one of its towers nearly toppled, by a rental-van bomb driven into an underground garage by Islamists back in 1993. The planes in the 2001 assaults were, as Mike Davis has written, simply car bombs with wings, and car bombs have a painfully long history. Even though in their targeting — the symbolic mega-buildings of an imperial power whose citizens previously preferred to believe themselves invulnerable — the 9/11 hijackers offered a new psychological reality to Americans, their most striking and unsettling feature was perhaps themselves. Those 19 men had pledged to commit suicide not for their country, as had thousands of Japanese kamikaze pilots at the end of World War II, or even for a potential country like hundreds of Tamil suicide bombers in Sri Lanka, but for a religious fantasy (behind which lay non-religious grievances). On the other hand, the 9/11 attacks were but a larger, more ambitious version of, for instance, the suicide-by-boat attack on the U.S.S. Cole in a Yemeni port in 2000.

On the other hand, the anthrax mailings represented something new. (The Japanese Aum Shinrikyo cult had attempted to make and use bio-weapons, including anthrax, back in 1990s, but failed.) If the al-Qaeda strike on 9/11 had only simulated a weapon-of-mass-destruction attack, with the anthrax killer, no imagination was necessary. An actual weapon of mass destruction — highly refined anthrax — had been used successfully, then used again, and the killer(s) remained at large, not in the Afghan backlands but somewhere in our midst, with no evidence that the supply of anthrax had been used up.

And yet, even as the Bush administration, the two presidential candidates, all of Washington, and the media remain focused on terrorism in the Afghan-Pakistani border regions, few give serious thought — except when it comes to individual culpability — to the terror that emerged from the depths of the military-industrial complex, from our own Cold War weapons labs. To that, no aspect of the Global War on Terror seems to apply.

6. Who is winning the Global War on Terror?

The answer, obviously, is the terrorists. Just last week, Mike McConnell, the director of national intelligence, made this crystal clear when it came to al-Qaeda. He testified before Congress that the organization “is gaining in strength from its refuge in Pakistan and is steadily improving its ability to recruit, train and position operatives capable of carrying out attacks inside the United States.” In fact, it’s been clear enough for quite a while that the Bush administration’s Global War on Terror has mainly succeeded in creating ever more terrorists in ever more places. And yet, arguably, the anthrax killer or killers have, to date, gained far more than al-Qaeda. Looked at a certain way, whatever the role of Bruce Ivins, the anthrax killings proved to be a full-scale triumph of terrorism.

One theory has long been that whoever committed the anthrax outrages was intent on drawing attention (and probably funding) to further research and development of U.S. bio-war “defenses.” If so, then, what a remarkable success! In the years since the attacks occurred, funding has flooded into such labs, whose numbers have grown strikingly. On September 11, 2001, reports the Washington Post, “there were only five u2018biosafety level 4′ labs — places equipped to study highly lethal agents such as Ebola that have no human vaccine or treatment — a Government Accountability Office report stated last fall. Fifteen are in operation or under construction now, according to the report. There are hundreds more biosafety level 3 labs, which handle agents such as Bacillus anthracis, which does have a human vaccine.”

The few hundred people at work in the U.S. bio-defense program before 9/11 have swelled to perhaps 14,000 scientists who have “clearances to work with u2018select biological agents’ such as Bacillus anthracis — many of them civilians working at private universities” where, according to experts, “security regulations are remarkably lax.” And don’t forget the Army’s own billion-dollar plan to “build a larger laboratory complex as part of a proposed interagency biodefense campus at Fort Detrick.” We’re talking about the place where, as Ivins’s crew was evidently nicknamed, “Team Anthrax” worked and whose labs are reputedly “renowned for losing anthrax.” In these same years, according to the New York Times, “almost $$50 billion in federal money has been spent to build new laboratories, develop vaccines and stockpile drugs.” Some of this money was pulled out of basic public health funds which once ensured that large numbers of people wouldn’t die of treatable diseases like tuberculosis and redirected into work on the Ebola virus, anthrax, and other exotic pathogens.

In these years, not to put too fine a point on it, the Bush administration has exponentially expanded our bio-war labs, increasing significantly the likelihood that a new “mad scientist” will have far more opportunity and far more deadly material available to work with. It has, in other words, increased the likelihood not just that terror will come to “the homeland,” but that it will come from the homeland. Thanks to this administration, the terrorists won this round and future terrorists can reap the fruits of that victory.

Bruce Ivins, whatever you did, or whatever was done to you, R.I.P. Your lab is in good hands. And the likelihood is that, almost seven years after the first anthrax envelope arrived, the world is more of a terror machine than ever.

Note on readings: Oddly enough, back in December 2002, as this site was going public, the very first TomDispatch guest writer, public health expert David Rosner, took up the issue of smallpox hysteria, pointing out that the disease was saved from total eradication on the planet by a U.S./USSR agreement “to make sure that the virus that causes smallpox would remain in storage awaiting a new opportunity to terrorize the world. For decades, both countries stored it, distributed it to various research labs and otherwise ensured that this public health victory would be turned into a potential human tragedy.” He added: “Fear of smallpox has played nicely into the overall strategy of the Bush administration to militarize public health.” It’s a piece worth revisiting, as perhaps is “It Should Have Been Unforgettable,” a post I wrote back in 2005 when the anthrax case had long fallen off the American radar screen.

More recently, Glenn Greenwald of Salon.com has done superb work on the anthrax story. In 2007, he wrote a striking column, “The unresolved story of ABC News’ false Saddam-anthrax reports,” on some crucially bad reporting by Brian Ross and ABC, and he followed up after Ivins’s suicide with a piece, (“Journalists, their lying sources, and the anthrax investigation,”) that has more unsettling questions about the anthrax case than any other 16 pieces I’ve seen. It’s a must read. Jay Rosen, at his always interesting PressThink blog, took up Greenwald’s challenge to Brian Ross and ABC on its reporting and pressed the point home in two recent posts, here and here.

Finally, Elisa D. Harris, a senior research scholar at the Center for International and Security Studies at the University of Maryland, had a fine, thoughtful op-ed last week in the New York Times, “The Killers in the Lab” (“Our efforts to fight biological weapons are making us less safe”), which laid out in an impressive way the expansion of U.S. bio-weapons research since 2001.

When establishment Republicans have addressed the problems of blacks at all, it has too often been in terms of what earmarked benefits can be offered in exchange for their votes. And there was very little that Republicans could offer to compete with the Democrats’ whole universe of welfare state earmarks.

Law and order, however, is not an earmarked benefit for any special group. It is a policy for all that is especially needed by law-abiding blacks, who are the principal victims of those who are not law-abiding. Wealth, Poverty and Po...

Education is another area where something that is needed by all segments of the population is especially needed by blacks and other low-income minorities. In other words, here again, there is no need for a divisive policy of earmarked benefits, in order to attract new voters into a “big tent.”

No matter what policy Republicans follow, they are not going to win a majority of the black votes this year, nor perhaps even this decade.

Nor is that necessary. Just an erosion of the Democrats’ monopoly of the black votes can benefit both Republicans and the black community, who are currently taken for granted by the Democrats. Republicans may also get more white votes if they are no longer seen by some as racists.

Education is a slam dunk issue for Republicans trying to appeal to black parents with school-age children, as distinguished from trying to appeal to all black voters as if all blacks are the same.

Education is an issue with little, if any, down side for the Republicans, because the teachers’ unions are the single biggest obstacle to black youngsters getting a decent education — and among the biggest donors to the Democrats.

Among the few signs of educational success for low-income minority children in the public schools are the KIPP and Success Academy charter schools. But teachers’ unions are bitterly opposed to increases in the number of such schools, and Democrats do what the teachers’ unions want, because money talks.

As long as blacks vote automatically for Democrats, while the teachers’ unions insist on getting their money’s worth, it is all but inevitable that the education of black children will be sacrificed in the public schools, wherever Democrats are in control.

Republicans have nothing to lose by taking on the teachers’ unions, which donate more than 90 percent of their money to Democrats. Again, Republicans may not win a majority of the votes of even those parents who have children in the public schools. But that is where any inroads into the black vote can begin. Intellectuals and Race Thomas Sowell Best Price: $$12.87 Buy New $$16.88 (as of 10:50 EST - Details)

Here, as elsewhere, a journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step. That step should include appeals not only to black parents with children in successful charter schools, but also the larger number of black parents on waiting lists for charter schools, and anyone else in the black community who understands that a good education is a key for the next generation to advance.

The black vote has not always been a monopoly of the Democrats. From the time of Abraham Lincoln to that of President Herbert Hoover the black vote was Republican. Even in the depths of the Great Depression of the 1930s, the black vote was one of the few that went to President Hoover in 1932.

Even after President Franklin D. Roosevelt won over black voters in FDR’s 1936 landslide, Republicans continued to get a significant share of the black vote over the next 20 years. But not in recent elections.

Someone on CNN said that if Trump were serious about wanting the black vote, he would address groups like the NAACP. That was, in fact, a big mistake that even President Reagan made.

Blacks voters are not the property of the NAACP, and they need to be addressed directly as individuals, over the heads of special interest organizations that have led blacks into the blind alley of being a voting bloc that has been taken for granted far too long.

Whether other Republicans will re-think their approach to attracting minority voters is a big unanswered question.

170070,"With this post, I begin a review of the book by Martin Van Creveld: “The Rise and Decline of the State.” Best to start with his opening statement in the Preface:

The state, which since the middle of the seventeenth century has been the most important and most characteristics of all modern institutions, is in decline.

Plenty of bloggers like me make such outlandish statements; so, who is Martin Van Creveld?

Van Creveld was born in the Netherlands in the city of Rotterdam to a Jewish family. His parents, Leon and Margaret, were staunch Zionists who had managed to evade the Nazis during World War II. One of Creveld’s uncles and several cousins were killed in the Holocaust. In 1950, the family immigrated to Israel, and Creveld grew up in Ramat Gan. He was drafted to the Israel Defense Forces and served in logistics, but was soon granted an early discharge for medical reasons due to his cleft palate. From 1964 to 1969, he studied history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and earned an MA. From 1969 to 1971, he studied history at the London School of Economics and received a PhD. His doctoral dissertation on Hitler’s strategy in the Balkans during the early years of World War II was later published into a book. After completing his PhD in 1971, van Creveld returned to Israel and began teaching at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He became a professor in 1988. In 2007, he retired from teaching at Hebrew University, and began teaching at Tel Aviv University’s Security Studies Program.

Two of his books are required reading for United States Army officers (The Transformation of War and Supplying War: Logistics from Wallenstein to Patton); there are only two other books written by non-American authors on the required reading list – the well-known books by Sun Tzu and Clausewitz, respectively. Not bad company.

Van Creveld has interesting views on current affairs:

In a TV interview in 2002, he expressed doubts as to the ability of the Israeli army to defeat the Palestinians: They [Israeli soldiers] are very brave people… they are idealists… they want to serve their country and they want to prove themselves. The problem is that you cannot prove yourself against someone who is much weaker than yourself. They are in a lose-lose situation. If you are strong and fighting the weak, then if you kill your opponent then you are a scoundrel… if you let him kill you, then you are an idiot….Now the Israeli army has not by any means been the worst of the lot. It has not done what for instance the Americans did in Vietnam… it did not use napalm, it did not kill millions of people. So everything is relative, but by definition, to return to what I said earlier, if you are strong and you are fighting the weak, then anything you do is criminal.

On a less comforting note:

In a September 2003 interview in Elsevier, a Dutch weekly, on Israel and the dangers it faces from Iran, the Palestinians and world opinion van Creveld stated: We possess several hundred atomic warheads and rockets and can launch them at targets in all directions, perhaps even at Rome. Most European capitals are targets for our air force…. We have the capability to take the world down with us. And I can assure you that that will happen before Israel goes under.

A frank assessment in a world gone MAD:

In the 21 August 2004 edition of the International Herald Tribune van Creveld wrote, “Had the Iranians not tried to build nuclear weapons, they would be crazy.” Van Creveld has stated that the Israeli government has “vastly exaggerated the threat that a nuclear Iran poses to its security, as well as Israel’s capacity to halt it.”

And a comment that moves him high on my list:

In 2005, van Creveld made headlines when he said in an interview that the 2003 invasion of Iraq was “the most foolish war since Emperor Augustus in 9 BC [sic] sent his legions into Germany and lost them”, a reference to the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. His analysis included harsh criticism of the Bush Administration, comparing the war to the Vietnam war. Moreover, he said that “Bush deserves to be impeached and, once he has been removed from office, put on trial.”

So much for the author; returning to this book:

From Western Europe to Africa, either voluntarily or involuntarily, many existing states are either combining into larger communities or falling apart…Regardless of whether they fall apart or combine, already now many of their functions are being taken over by a variety of organizations which, whatever their precise nature, are not states. Needless to say, these developments affect each and every individuals now living on this planet. In some places they will proceed peacefully, but in others they are likely to result in – indeed are already leading to – upheavals as profound, and possibly as bloody, as those that propelled humanity out of the Middle Ages and into the modern world. Whether the direction of change is desirable as some hope, or undesirable, as others fear, remains to be seen.

We are living through this battle – centralizing forces against decentralizing forces. It remains my view that the peak of centralization occurred at the end of the Second World War (with the US government being the primary tool for establishing world government) and lasted, perhaps, until the fall of the Soviet Union. Since then, there have been some wins and some losses (from the viewpoint of those favoring decentralization); I would argue, on balance, that decentralization is winning.

There are certainly more nation-states – yes, states, however any move toward “more” is a move toward decentralization. The conflicts we have seen since the fall of the Berlin Wall appear to be nothing more than the forces of centralization thrashing about – suffering a deadly wound yet still dangerous enough to cause harm.

It seems to me that technology is on our side – yes, it offers tools for those who desire to control us, but it offers more tools for us to gain liberty. Generally, when looking across the globe, more people (and a higher percentage of people) have more relative freedom than at any time in the last 100 years or more.

Van Creveld divides his book into six chapters:

Before the state: prehistory to AD 1300: a time of recorded and unrecorded history with no state and little government in the sense we have come to know the word. So much for the “when has anarchy worked” strawman.

The rise of the state: 1300 to 1648: described by Van Creveld as “the period from approximately 1300 (the Res Publica Christiana at its zenith) to 1648 (the Treaty of Westphalia).” When this thing called “the state” emerged from the Middle Ages – the time of the binding of culture brought on by the Church through the series of treaties that ended wars between and amongst the Holy Roman Empire, Spain and the Dutch Republic. The Treaty – actually a series of treaties – deserves comment:

The treaties resulted from the big diplomatic congress, thereby initiating a new system of political order in central Europe, later called Westphalian sovereignty, based upon the concept of a sovereign state governed by a sovereign and establishing a prejudice in international affairs against interference in another nation’s domestic business.

Obviously a concept no longer respected.

The state as an instrument: 1648 to 1789: this is the period through the French Revolution, a time that witnessed the creation of many of the state’s most characteristic institutions: bureaucracy, armed forces, the gathering of statistics, police and prisons.

The state as an ideal: 1789 to 1945: Per Van Creveld:

…states…transformed themselves from instruments for imposing law and order into secular gods; and how, having increased their strength out of all proportion by invading their citizens’ minds and picking their pockets, they used that strength to fight each other (1914 – 1945) on such a scale, and with such murderous intensity, as almost to put an end to themselves.

It seems it isn’t only libertarians and anarchists who speak this way about the state.

The timing of the beginning of the end (the Great War) corresponds quite well with the picture painted by Jacques Barzun.

The spread of the state: 1696 to 1975: This chapter describes the spread of this concept of “state” to all corners of the world.

The decline of the state: 1975 – (I know…the lack of an end date is a real pill): collapse, as in Yugoslavia (and I will add, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and many others currently in progress); giving up some portion of sovereignty, as in the European Union.

This is the outline; I will proceed as I have with other books – with one or more follow-on posts as I find it worthwhile. I suspect I will find it worthwhile.

225848,"To paraphrase Einstein, not everything worth measuring is measurable and not everything measurable is worth measuring. The purchasing power of money falls into the former category. It is worth measuring, in that it would be useful to have a single number that consistently reflected the economy-wide purchasing power of money. However, such a number doesn’t exist.

Such a number doesn’t exist because a sensible result cannot be arrived at by summing or averaging the prices of disparate items. For example, it makes no sense to average the prices of a car, a haircut, an apple, a dental checkup, a gallon of gasoline and an airline ticket. And yet, that is effectively what the government does  in a complicated way designed to make the end result lower than it would otherwise be  when it determines the CPI.

The government concocts economic statistics for propaganda purposes, but our point here is that even the most honest and rigorous attempt to use price data to determine a single number that consistently paints an accurate picture of money purchasing power will fail. It will necessarily fail because it is an attempt to do the impossible.

The goal of determining real (inflation-adjusted) performance is not completely hopeless, though, because we know what causes long-term changes in money purchasing power and we can roughly estimate the long-term effects of these causes. In particular, we know that the purchasing power of money falls due to increased money supply and rises due to increased population and productivity. By using the known rates of increase in the money supply and the population and a ‘guesstimate’ of the rate of increase in labour productivity we can arrive at a theoretical rate of change for the purchasing power of money. This theoretical rate of purchasing-power change will tend to be inaccurate over periods of a year or less but should approximate the actual rate of purchasing-power change over periods of five years or more. We’ve been using the theoretical rate of purchasing power change, calculated as outlined above, to construct long-term inflation-adjusted (IA) charts for almost two years now. Here are the updated versions of some of these charts, based on data as at the end of May. 1. In current dollar terms, the oil price peaked at just under $$200/barrel in 2008 and at around $$170/barrel in 1980. It is now only slightly above its 40-year average. We doubt that oil will ever again trade below $$50/barrel in nominal dollar terms. Also, the 2008 peak was almost certainly the secular variety, so we probably won’t see the IA oil price trade above its 2008 peak any time this decade. If oil does make a new high in IA terms within the next few years it will be because of a major Middle East conflagration that greatly reduces the global supply of oil, not because of rising demand or geological limitations on supply.

2. As is the case with oil, in IA terms the copper price probably made a secular peak in 2008. As is also the case with oil, the IA copper price is now only slightly above its 40-year average. Falling demand due to a global recession over the next 12 months could cause the copper price to drop back to $$2.00, but we doubt that it would stay that low for long because economic weakness always prompts central banks to boost the money supply. However, future rounds of QE (or whatever other name they give to the money pumping) probably won’t do anywhere near as much for the IA copper price as the earlier rounds did. Another way of saying this is that copper probably won’t be one of the main beneficiaries of future monetary inflation. One reason is that China’s construction boom is turning to bust. Another is that the high prices of the past six years have increased the current and future supplies of this metal. In 2012 dollar terms we think a copper price in the $$2.50-$$3.50 range is about right. We would therefore steer clear of copper mining projects that required a copper price of much above $$3.00/pound to be economically robust and we would be wary of low-grade copper projects with unknown economics.

3. In early 2008, the combination of fear that electrical power shortages in South Africa would severely disrupt the global platinum supply and fear of Fed-sponsored dollar depreciation drove the IA platinum price above $$3000/oz (about $$2300/oz at the time, which is the equivalent of just over $$3000/oz in terms of today’s dollar). This will probably turn out to be a secular peak for the IA platinum price, although platinum stands a better chance than either oil or copper of exceeding its 2008 peak in IA dollars. There are two reasons for this. First, platinum supply is more concentrated and therefore more vulnerable to disruption than oil or copper supply. Second, we expect that platinum will benefit from the continuing upward trend in the IA gold price. We may be interested in buying platinum if it drops to $$1200/oz.

4. The IA gold price continued its long-term upward trend following a normal intermediate-term correction during the 2008 crisis. It is yet to experience a major upside blow-off like it did in the lead-up to its January-1980 peak and like the oil, copper and platinum markets did leading up to their 2008 peaks.

5. In nominal dollar terms, silver’s April-2011 peak was a test of its January-1980 peak. In IA terms, however, silver’s highest price in April of 2011 was only slightly more than one-third of its 1980 peak. Silver’s January-1980 peak was so extraordinary that it will possibly never be exceeded or even seriously challenged in IA terms, but there’s a high probability that silver will handily exceed last year’s peak in IA terms before its long-term bull market comes to an end. This is largely because although industrial demand plays a much bigger role in the silver market than in the gold market, investment demand is still the primary driver of silver’s long-term bull market. Furthermore, the same factors that should continue to boost the investment demand for gold (government and central bank stupidity in all its forms) are likely to do the same for silver.

6. Because the official ""inflation"" indices chronically understate the reduction in currency purchasing power, using these indices to calculate inflation-adjusted performance overstates the performance. That’s why Malthusians such as Jeremy Grantham are able to use CPI-adjusted charts of the CRB Index to support their theories that the world is about to run short of valuable agricultural and industrial commodities. These CPI-adjusted charts suggest that the ultra-long-term downward trend in ""real"" commodity prices has ended, an implication being that commodity supply is now in a long-term downward trend relative to real commodity demand. The picture is very different if our preferred method is used to adjust for the effects of inflation. As illustrated by the following chart, the IA CRB Index made a new all-time low in 2001 and then peaked in 2008 at well below its 1974 and 1980 highs. There is no evidence that its long-term downward trend has ended.

217335,"It’s not only the Americans who are eating their seedcorn.

In a study of Britons’ savings habit (u2018What saving habit?’ you might well ask!), Sainsbury’s Bank said that while people were generally advised to save between 10 and 15 per cent of their income, their research had found that the 12.4 million people who are in full-time work were saving just 4.7 per cent, while the 3.7 million part-time workers were putting aside barely 3 per cent.

Performing a little arithmetic, the bank told the Scotsman that this suggested that people were saving 31 billion — around the present size of the whole national debt! — too little each year to have a comfortable retirement, meaning many people would have no choice but to work on beyond 65.

According to the study, two-thirds of people who were not saving enough, smoothed down their new designer-labelled threads, looked up from their bottle of Premier Cru, pushed away the plate of langoustine served up at their regular table in a swanky little city-centre bistro, folded away the statements from the car leasing company, and cut the real estate agent off the mobile phone, to complain that it was because they could not afford to.

(OK — a touch heavy on the sarcasm, perhaps, but you catch my drift.)

There might be little surprise either to know that 14 per cent said they thought savings products offered poor value, while 11 per cent said that they did not trust savings institutions.

But, if the bear market has given you a jaundiced view of all those you formerly regarded as money management superstars, to the point you no longer have any confidence in the easy promises of the whole motley of charlatans, spivs, and fat cats you now consider to work in the City, or on Wall Street, it’s a good job you can rely on the benign shepherds in government to provide for you in your old age then, isn’t it folks?

Well, you can, can’t you? Can’t you?

Derek Bottom, the deputy chief executive of Sainsbury’s Bank, said: “The government and the financial services sector as a whole is faced with a very real and difficult challenge to educate people as to why they need to take greater responsibility over their finances.”

“This calls for radical changes based around strong government reassurances to consumers and greater product transparency and flexibility so that people can see how their savings and investments can help them at different stages of their lives.”

We would demur since, firstly, this — like most things — is not a matter for government, but rather for PERSONAL responsibility, while removing — not extending — u2018reassurances’ — is what is needed to motivate people to make shift to cater for their own requirements, rather than relying on the State to rob their unwilling grandchildren in order to support them in their dotage.

Secondly, being lectured on financial prudence by the government is rather like being encouraged to live a healthy lifestyle by a tobacco company.

Which single institution, after all, routinely and mainly wastefully spends much more than it can afford, builds up actual and contingent liabilities willy-nilly in order to gratify its tastes today, undertakes no actuarial accounting whatsoever, but relies on tomorrow’s income to meet today’s bills, and — if it falls short — either takes the money it needs by the threat of force, or defaults — if rarely outright, these days, at least in part, through the sneaky means of inflation?

Moreover, which institution — in cahoots with its pals at the central bank — is so inimical to thrift, to the accumulation of capital, and to the reinvestment of u2018unearned’ (read: u2018already taxed’) income that saving to provide for your retirement becomes such a daunting prospect in the first place?

In a society which the collapse in investment, the crisis in pensions and insurance and soaring personal indebtedness continues to make the headlines, does it seem a trifle strange — not to say hugely counterproductive — that interest rates are at 40-odd year lows, something which, in a free market, would signal we were replete with genuine capital, not faced with a frightening shortfall of the stuff?

370850,"Being in college, I’ve met plenty of people with some crazy politics, but I’ve only started to learn about their specific ideas or why they have them. Of course they all spout the usual platitudes about helping the poor and promoting equality and maintaining civil order, and always the ol’ “But what would you do about ______?” My answer to this question is, “Ah, yes, the one question everyone likes to ask libertarians. It’s funny no one else has to answer that question, seeing as how they’re the ones who screwed everything up.”

Since their arguments consist entirely of things like this — “But that couldn’t work!,"" “But how would this work?!,"" “Libertarianism is just a cruel, greedy, heartless, every-man-for-himself, social-Darwinist philosophy” — I have learned more from contemplating their ideas than from hearing about them. I would like to regale you with some of the ideas two communist friends of mine have. One is a self-described communist, though he is not quite as communist as you’d think. The second calls herself a feminist.

The guy’s objections to freedom seem to revolve around police protection. I’ll try to constrain my rant for the sake of brevity, as Brad Edmonds, Bruce Benson, and Mary Ruwart have already explained why such fears are unfounded. He thinks people would form security companies with guns, bombs, and armies for the sole purpose of robbing the people in the next town over who don’t have as large of an army. People have been doing that for thousands of years, except they didn’t call them companies, they called them governments. No company has ever killed lots of people, and this isn’t because of the supervision of their gracious governments. I had lots of simple refutations of this fear, but I’ll content myself with one: It is humanly impossible to think even a semi-large group of people would voluntarily contribute their own money and bodies to go to “war” against a non-aggressing group without a state involved.

He also thinks the poor in the inner city would simply have no police protection (in stark contrast to their current situation). What about everyone else’s protection against their agents, our elected criminal class, who take our money without hesitation? We literally have no recourse against them, no protection whatsoever. Where is our state-provided police protection? It would be the crime of crimes to protect ourselves against agents of the state who come to take our rightfully earned property to help someone who neither knows nor cares about us, who thinks it is his right. Forgive me if I don’t jump at the chance to have money taken from me instead of giving it voluntarily. Maybe if they were allowed to have their God-given rights, the wealthy and middle class would help the poor to have the basic necessities of life that any civilized member of society deserves. Perhaps if they let it happen, the poor who haven’t enough money for police protection would receive the charity — corporate and individual — that supposedly would not be available in a dark, selfish, greedy, capitalist libertarian world. I, personally, would prefer to do business with security companies that did something to help the poor over companies that didn’t: the good PR alone would boost their business and their stock, enriching me.

Apparently my argument that we already pay for police protection now, somehow, so if we had even more money in an even stronger economy, we could even more easily pay for it, doesn’t convince him. The free market always has and always will make more goods available for more people at lower prices. Yes, police protection would be one of many tough issues a libertarian society would have to deal with, but how about food, water, housing, electricity, schooling, and transportation? Those seem just a tad more basic to me, and the free market has done pretty well with them, where it’s allowed to. Plus, prosperity reduces crime. (And don’t give me that “rich get richer while the poor get poorer” crap. Read this.) But their problem isn’t just doubting that there would be enough money to pay for police protection for everybody; their problem is with the free market, which, as Milton Friedman so aptly noted, underlies “a lack of belief in freedom itself.”

He has other similar objections. They exemplify the alarming misconceptions about libertarianism possessed by young Americans, which I try to combat, in part, by sharing my experiences here. “Oh, if this were a libertarian society, no one would have any water because one person would buy the whole city’s water supply and say, ‘Ah, sucks for you! You want my water? $$8 a glass.’ No one could afford it!” “Oh, if this were a libertarian society, there would be no laws, we could just drive on any side of the street, in any direction, whatever!” “Oh, I’m a libertarian, I’m going to go kill babies and animals because there are no laws in a libertarian society!” Obviously, he’s sort of joking, but he could just reword them seriously and present them as his real objections to a free society. It’s sad. I just make fun of him anymore, rather than refuting him.

His main problem is his sort of romantic fondness of the Soviet Union. He has a hammer-and-sickle flag in his apartment, a T-shirt that says “CCCP,"" and one of them fur hat-type dealies he bought from bornintheussr.com. Ushankas, I think they’re called. I think he just likes the camaraderie, the hardiness, the nationalism of the Soviets, the loyalty to Great Mother Russia when they were an evil empire.

The girl is a slightly more interesting case. She does not call herself a communist or a socialist, but something she said identifies her as one. My roommates, several friends, and I were in our living room watching a Georgia away game together, her and the communist included. Somehow the topic of shooting intruders in self-defense came up, and the aforementioned communist easily agreed that people have every right to shoot anyone who breaks into their home or business. (See? He has more common sense than you’d think.) This liberal feminist, on the other hand, said — are you ready? — that we have a right to defend ourselves if our lives are in danger, but we have no right to use force to protect our property. I guess this also includes the threat of force. It would have to, logically. We would be unable prevent someone from breaking and entering with no weapons, since she would say no gun owner could claim a threat to his life from an unarmed intruder. Then again, her solution would undoubtedly be to remove all guns from society, excluding the government, of course, so that would get rid of all violent crime altogether, right?

I was taken aback by this. I didn’t expect it. I didn’t think anyone could think one but not the other. We can defend our bodies, but not what we earn and produce with our bodies? This is what passes for logic among college students? This is the level of understanding of civics, society, politics, and property possessed by young American adults who can vote?

So to whom does it fall to protect private property, defend against criminals, punish perpetrators? I guess that’s the almighty, omniscient government’s job. If she had read the wonderful, beautiful, short treatise on government that I recommend to everyone who will listen, Bastiat’s The Law, she would not have such dangerous ideas contaminating her otherwise robust mind.

In The Law, Bastiat explains how the law (government) “is the collective organization of the individual right to lawful defense.” The government is not some extraneous entity that graciously watches over us like a lord or a god and rights what it thinks is wrong. It is not outside society, apart from us. Rather, the government — or whatever name is given to a society’s system of property protection — is an extension of each citizen. (And by “lawful,” he of course means abiding by the moral, human laws given to us by our creator, the ones that are engrained into the universe, not the ones that corrupt men in legislatures wrote.) “Each of us has a natural right — from God — to defend his person, his liberty, and his property. These are the three basic requirements of life, and the preservation of any one of them is completely dependent upon the preservation of the other two. For what are our faculties but the extension of our individuality? And what is property but an extension of our faculties?”

But why do we have these innate rights? Why is the protection of one dependent on the other two? This paragraph sums it up nicely: “Life, faculties, production — in other words, individuality, liberty, property — this is man. And in spite of the cunning of artful political leaders, these three gifts from God precede all human legislation, and are superior to it. Life, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place.” This might very well be my favorite political quote of all time. I feel I must stop with The Law before I get carried away and just quote the entire pamphlet.

By separating possession of property (an individual function) from protection of property (a state function), her notion separates the state from the society, which isn’t entirely surprising since the state and society are incompatible and mutually exclusive.

Under this type of state, assuming we still have the rights to own and acquire property, why do we have them? Why do life, liberty, and property supposedly exist? Because the state “protects” them. Because it gives them to us. Because it says so. Which means it can say not. It can take them away. The logic is clear to me, but if you don’t see that it follows logically, it certainly follows realistically, that if the government is the supreme protector and arbiter of “our” property, then it will eventually become the owner of “our” property. It is easy to grasp how easily and naturally a government that is granted extra-societal status will soon begin to follow extra-societal rules, i.e., rules it makes up on its own. These rules are, by definition, different from our innate, individual human laws. This means it can and will do things we individually cannot do. In doing so, it violates the very rights it was created to protect! This is why the state and civilization are mutually exclusive. Where one exists, the other must not exist.

Even if not one of its subjects nor the elected and unelected criminals in the government realizes this, it will happen. Rights will be violated, little by little, intentionally and unintentionally. It has happened in every human society that ever existed, and will happen in every one that exists for a considerable time into the future, until people slowly get it right. Maybe one of God’s tests for us is to achieve an entirely stateless human universe, to eliminate coercive government altogether. We will definitely be settled on moons and planets in other solar systems before that happens, if we can survive that long. If not, I think we’ll know what to blame.

What my friend and millions of other leftists do not understand is that if our intrinsic right to defend our property is not recognized, then our rights to own and acquire property become equally unrecognized. If this communist policy of hers were enacted, then no, our rights to our current and future property would not magically vanish in practice as they do in logic; they would, rather, become steadily less and less recognized and thus less and less allowed, until the state’s position as our lord and master were so engrained into the minds of its subjects that private property rights of any kind would become unrecognized. This is precisely the essence of any communist state. The state will always grow, by its nature, no matter what you do. If you make it not only legitimate but necessary that the state be large and powerful, then its growth is thereby accelerated greatly.

Just as the government would no longer be an extension of society, our property could no longer be considered an extension of ourselves. The one necessarily implies the other. This is because government (just government) is the protection of property. By taking away our supreme rights to what we own, the state would be taking away what we have produced, which are the fruits of our labor, which is, in effect, our labor itself, which means it would be taking away what we have done — our past. Our past actions are part of ourselves, and no person or entity can claim a part of another person’s life. But this is what an inability to protect our property amounts to. It is not always easy to see, and less easy to elucidate, but it is true nonetheless.

I know her solution to the problem of unbounded state power is, “Well, if we could just elect enough Democrats, or the right Democrats, and not such a large proportion of them men, who are violent and aggressive by nature, then our gracious government would protect us justly, as it should.” Yeah, right. Typical leftist anti-realism, which unfortunately has been exhibited by the leftists in that other party an awful lot, too.

I will probably never know what leads her and other communists to think self-defense does not include defense of property. It isn’t a lack of exposure to libertarian literature such as The Law, because I have thought shooting intruders was not only a right but a noble service to society ever since I was a child. It isn’t hubris, envy, or scapegoating, which are the root causes of all evil acts ever committed. Now, it is certainly hubris that leads one to think that a government that is both powerful and just isn’t a metaphysical impossibility, and that a powerful government run only by liberal feminist Democrats would both do what she wants and engineer the economy and society to something resembling harmony or prosperity. But it doesn’t explain why she thinks we don’t have a right to injure or kill someone who is forcefully taking our property. Maybe there is no root psychological reason. Some people are just wrong about things, and only the observation of the harmfulness of their ideas put into practice can make them see that. Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.

291885,"Recently: Doug Casey on Cars — Past, Present, and Future

L: Doug, we talked last week about getting assets out of your home country, especially the U.S., where to take them and what to do with them. In so doing, you touched on the inevitability of currency controls just ahead, especially for Americans. Can you tell us more about that?

Doug: Yes, I’m quite serious about what I said about ""the grim reality of impending currency controls."" As the global economy continues to deteriorate, governments will have to appear to be ""doing something."" It’s going to become very fashionable to institute some sort of foreign exchange control.

Why might that be? Because obviously, people who are taking their money out of the country are unpatriotic…

L: Those bastards.

Doug: That’s right. Jingoistic Americans naturally, but stupidly, see taking money out of the country as being unpatriotic. They don’t understand that it’s mainly those prudent people who will be able to supply the capital to rebuild a devastated economy later. Besides, getting money abroad is obviously something that only rich people would do… and of course, it’s time to eat the rich, as well. For those two reasons, there won’t be much resistance to controls. And the state gets to appear to be ""doing something.""

And when they do, more people — at least those with any sense — will get scared and really try to get their money out, which will exacerbate the run to the exits. The bottom line is that if you want to get your money out, the time to do it is now. Beat the last-minute rush.

I don’t know what form the exchange controls are going to take, but there are two general possibilities: regulation and taxation.

The regulations might take the form of a rule prohibiting you from taking more than X-thousands of dollars abroad per year without special permission. No expensive vacations, no foreign asset purchases without state approval.

As for the taxation, if you want to, say, buy foreign stocks or real estate, you might have to pay an ""Interest Equalization Tax"" or some such. So, you could do it, but it’d cost you a lot of money to do it.

Something like either of these, or both, is definitely in the cards.

L: But aren’t FX controls something from the past? I mean, where do they exist today?

Doug: Well, FX controls have been used since the days of the Roman Empire. A country debases its currency, raises taxes beyond a certain level, and makes regulations too onerous — and productive people naturally react by getting their capital, and then themselves, out of Dodge. But the government can’t have that, so it puts on FX controls. They’re almost inevitable at this point.

Almost every country — except for the U.S., Canada, Switzerland, and a few others —had them until at least the ’70s. I remember leaving Britain once in the ’60s, and a border guy searched me to see if I had more than 50 pounds on me. In those days currency violations in the Soviet Bloc countries could get you the death penalty. Things liberalized around the world with Reagan and Thatcher, and then the collapse of the USSR. But you have to remember that that was in the context of the Long Boom. Now, during the Greater Depression, things will become much stricter again.

Right now, the U.S. just has reporting requirements. But some places, like South Africa, make it very expensive and inconvenient to get money out. South Africa, perversely, may serve as a model for the U.S.

L: Okay, so, we talked last week about Americans at least setting up a Canadian bank account and safe deposit box, and better yet going in person to Panama, Uruguay, Malaysia, or a similar place to do the same. And once there, you advised getting with a lawyer, either referred by someone you trust or found through an interview process, to set up a corporation that can handle your assets and investments for you. This all needs to be reported but it’s wise to do it in advance of the higher costs or other limitations to come.

Doug: Yes. While U.S. persons must report foreign bank and brokerage accounts, safe deposit boxes are not — at least not yet — reportable. This leads me to the biggest and best ""loophole"" when it comes to potential foreign exchange controls, and that’s foreign real estate.

I’m of the opinion that, broadly speaking, real estate as an asset class is going to be a poor performer for a long time to come — but that won’t be equally true across all countries. Real estate in countries that rely on mortgage debt to buy and sell will continue to be the worst hit.

People don’t understand that buying property with a mortgage is just the same as buying stocks on margin. It’s caused speculative bubbles and malinvestment. Until the malinvestment in those countries is entirely liquidated, you don’t want to invest in real estate in them. But a lot of countries, especially in the third world, have no mortgage debt whatsoever. Zero mortgage debt. You want a piece of property, you pay for it in cash. That keeps prices down and the market much more stable. And it makes for more interesting speculations, because if a mortgage market develops in the future, it could light a fire under prices.

But, from the viewpoint of FX controls, the nice thing about real estate is that there is no way they can make you repatriate it. Other than owning a business abroad, real estate is the only sure way to legally keep your capital offshore.

L: I suppose it would be difficult for even Uncle Sam to seize your estancia in Argentina… not without starting a war.

Doug: Yes. Although I don’t doubt he’ll be starting more wars as well… [Laughs]

L: So, part of your thinking here isn’t just speculative. You’re talking about strategies for wealth preservation, not just in the face of foreign exchange controls, but more aggressive, predatory taxation and confiscation by the state — they can seize your assets, even real estate, in the U.S., but not abroad.

Doug: Exactly. Argentina is excellent from that point of view; rights to real property are, if anything, better than those in the U.S. In many ways, Argentina is culturally and demographically more like Europe than Europe. Uruguay is also excellent, although culturally it’s like a backward province of Argentina. Paraguay is quite secure — but a bit weird as a place to live.

I’m not currently up-to-date on the Chilean real estate market, but Chile is definitely now the richest and most advanced South American country, and an excellent choice. Brazil is fine. Colombia is improving greatly. Ecuador has a goofy president, but parts of it are very nice, and it’s about as cheap as Argentina. Eastern Bolivia is interesting, actually, despite Morales. Only Venezuela is out of the question in South America — but Chavez won’t last forever. It’s just a pity they have all that oil, which is always a corrupting influence.

L: Well, then, what about Central America? I know you prefer South America for speculative purposes, but what if someone wants to park a lot of wealth by buying a couple miles of beautiful beachfront property in Costa Rica, or some place like that?

Doug: I was a big fan of Costa Rica for many years… The first time I went down there was 35 years ago — but it’s a different place now. Then, it was very cheap, and now it’s very expensive. And it’s totally overrun with gringos. So, Costa Rica is not of that much interest to me at this point; it’s pleasant, but there’s limited upside.

I think an excellent place to be in Central America is Belize. Although culturally and ethnically, it’s not really part of Central America; it’s part of the Caribbean.

L: And they speak English there.

Doug: They do indeed, though things are changing. The Guatemalan government has always regarded British Honduras, which is what Belize used to be called, as part of Guatemala. There have actually been confrontations between Britain and Guatemala over this. But that’s in the past; now there’s a different problem. Guatemalans are rolling over the border in much the same way that Mexicans are in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.

So, the character of Belize is changing, but for the foreseeable future, it’s still going to be Belize, and I rather like it. Aside from Panama, Belize would be my first choice in Central America.

The problem with Central America, however, is that it’s a bunch of small countries that have historically been very unstable. And culturally backward. Most are under the thumb of the United States… there’s a long history of U.S. invasions, most recently in Panama with Noriega. There are Frito Banditos running around these places…

The most culturally advanced country in Central America, not counting Mexico, of course, since it’s in North America, is Guatemala. But Guatemala has had huge troubles with violence, which has only recently come to an end… I hate going through checkpoints at night, manned by jumpy, uneducated, heavily armed teenagers.

Nicaragua is the low-cost alternative, but it’s relatively backward. Panama is probably the best choice. It’s very international, very urban (in Panama City), and it’s very sophisticated, infrastructure-wise.

If I didn’t like Argentina and Uruguay so much, I would put Panama at the top of my shopping list.

L: Got it. Back to the exchange controls themselves. Do you think people will have any warning at all? It seems to me that this is the sort of thing the Powers That Be would want to spring on people.

Doug: I think it’s going to come out of left field. It always does, with at most an official denial just before it happens. In August 1971, Nixon devalued the dollar, which immediately dropped against gold and all foreign currencies. I think there’s a reasonable probability that the government will do that again. Gold may not be part of the equation, but they may decide to put in some sort of fixed exchange rate between the dollar and various foreign currencies.

The reason for thinking this is simple: with all the dollars outside the United States devalued by that much, that much of a liability just vanishes into thin air. And in the short term — it’s never a long-term fix — U.S. exports would go up. This would ""stimulate"" the domestic economy. Imports to the U.S. would go down, which would make for fewer dollars leaving the U.S. and adding to the $$7 trillion overhang the U.S. already has.

L: I know you hate making predictions, but can you tell us if your ""guru sense"" is tingling on this so strongly that you think it could happen this year? Or is this more of a 2010 possibility? 2011?

Doug: The timing on this is really unpredictable. These people don’t have a plan. They’re acting ""ad hoc"" to whatever seems most urgent. All the so-called ""economists"" around government today are really just political hacks. Their world views are totally unsound.

If you don’t believe me, check out the YouTube video of the clueless chief inspector of the Fed that’s circulating on the Internet.

L: With all the problems the U.S. has, do you think this could happen now? Could we be reading about new exchange controls on CNN.com this afternoon?

Doug: Sure. Although they typically pull these stunts over a weekend. I expect something of this nature to happen any time between tomorrow morning and two years from now. If some form of currency controls are not instituted within two years, I’m going to be genuinely surprised.

So, if you’re going to take action, you should start heading for the exits now. Not next month, and certainly not next year.

L: For those who don’t take action until it’s too late, under the scenarios you mentioned, they’ll still be able to get money out. It’s just that it might be more difficult, time consuming, humiliating, and certainly more expensive to do. For every $$100,000 they move, only $$90,000, or $$70,000, or whatever will get to where it’s supposed to go. Can you foresee a more Stalinesque alternative, where they simply can’t get anything out at all?

Doug: Hopefully not. Anything is possible, and things can change so rapidly… but I’d hate to think of what conditions would be like if they ever became that draconian. It’d be so bad on other fronts that there would be all sorts of even more urgent things on your mind — Americans would get a very quick and unpleasant education in the real meaning of Maslow’s hierarchy.

L: Like the Mad Max-style neobarbarians at the door with a battering ram.

Doug: Exactly — that’s when you’ll definitely want to be in more pleasant climes. I’d want to be watching it on my wide-screen, in comfort, not out my front window.

L: We’re talking about extremes here…

Doug: You know, back in the 1970s there was a spate of books published on financial privacy. In those days, financial privacy was still possible. Now, it’s not only no longer truly possible, short of embracing a completely outlaw lifestyle, it’s very dangerous to write about it or even talk about it. I kid you not. These days, people who ask too many questions about privacy techniques may well be government stooges…

There’s lots of handwriting on the wall. All those books on financial privacy were published in the ’70s — if you look on Amazon, you can still find them. But there’s nothing really worth reading that’s been written on the subject in 20 years. It’s actively discouraged by the government. I could name — but I won’t — at least two authors that got themselves into a real jackpot this way. Forget about the First Amendment.

In fact, I even feel uncomfortable talking about it in this interview.

So let me once again emphasize that I advise everyone to stay fully within the bounds of the law.

That’s not for moral reasons, of course; there is no morality to the law. It’s strictly for reasons of practicality. Risk-reward ratio.

L: Understood. Loud and clear. Any more investment implications, besides foreign real estate, that you want to draw attention to here?

Doug: Yes — and it’s another reason for those so very clever boys in Washington to embrace currency controls. They will be disastrous for the U.S. economy, but there’s a very good chance that, in the short run, they’ll be very good for the stock market. That’s partly for the reasons I already mentioned about it temporarily boosting U.S. exports, and hence earnings of U.S. exporters, but also because all that money that can’t leave the U.S. will have to go into something.

Investors will probably want to put it into equity, rather than debt, while the dollar is depreciating. Again, it’s disastrous over the long term, but as a short-term play, buying the blue chips the day the exchange controls are instituted could be a good move.

L: You’d buy the Dow?

Doug: I might, if I couldn’t think of anything more intelligent or original to do. We’ll just have to see what the situation is like.

L: This will be a development we’ll have to keep an eye out for in The Casey Report, then.

Doug: Yes, we will. The more politically controlled an environment, the more distortions are created. And the better it is for a speculator.

L: Thanks again, Doug — you’ve given us a lot to think about.

219957,"Economists are among the noteworthy proponents of the ""legalization"" of narcotic drugs, cocaine and marijuana. However, public proclamations have been few in number, short on details, and muted by recommendations such as Gary Becker from the University of Chicago who advocates legalization combined with a heavy ""sin"" tax to discourage use.

To further investigate the views of economists I have conducted two surveys. The first one involved a random selection of economists while the second examined what economists have written on the subject of drug policy. The first survey found that economists supported legalization, liberalization, and decriminalization much more than the general population, but not much more than their demographic cohort of highly educated individuals.

In the second survey, academic journals, books, and other sources were combed for explicit policy recommendations regarding the market for illegal drugs. Here the overwhelming majority of economists concluded that drug policy should be liberalized to some extent. The results represent the broad spectrum of economists, but are heavily weighted to the Austrian, Chicago, and Public Choice schools of economic thought. In looking for those who recommended radical legalization, the number of supporters shrank significantly and was largely confined to the members of the Austrian school.

You can read the full report and all the quotes on drug policy online. This article appears in the inaugural issue of Econ Journal Watch, which was established and edited by Daniel Klein. I would describe the journal as Austrian-leaning and of interest to anyone who follows developments in academic economics and economic policy.

Global climate is always changing. It has always been so, and it is bound to continue changing long after man has come and gone. As the global climate changes, so does the distribution of temperature and atmospheric gas composition around and about the Earth. And the converse is also true. For whatever reasons yet to be learned by scientific study, changes in the Earth's temperature and atmospheric composition will lead to global climate changes regardless of what the Sun is doing.

Which came first, the chicken or the egg? The scientific study of the relevant phenomena is a very recent endeavor in human history, which is a few thousand years out of billions in geological terms. Knowledge is skimpy and the few findings extant are subject to considerable uncertainty. There is this old complaint: ""Everybody talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it."" This is not quite true. Cloud-seeding technology was developed relatively recently and is being practiced in specific situations to produce local precipitation. The Chinese government has disclosed plans to employ cloud seeding on a grand scale in an attempt to improve the air over Beijing during the 2008 Summer Olympic Games.

Beyond such puny measures, humans seem to have little or nothing to do with the Earth's climate except to study it. In any case, understanding the human contribution to global climate change, if any, would seem to be a prerequisite for pontification on the matter. If sufficient authority to pronounce the causes of global climate is not yet at hand, there is certainly no illegitimate authority for regimenting human behavior presumed to cause it. It is now widely believed that the climate of the earth is warming and that such warming is a threat to life on the planet. It is also believed that this global-warming is caused by a so-called greenhouse effect exacerbated by the presence of an excess of CO2 in the atmosphere put there by promiscuous human activity. Alarm over the dreaded greenhouse effect is spreading rapidly throughout the population via the mass media. A political stampede toward the enforcement of draconian CO2 abatement measures in society is in the making. The sky is falling. Look out below!

Although the threat to the planet, if any, is only hypothetical at this time, few of the anthropogenic global-warming believers realize that the forceful abatement of human CO2 emissions will inflict world-wide human sacrifice. If they did, they might be more skeptical of the hype and less patronizing of the promoters. As it is, ignorance of the economic consequences of political action against CO2 emissions is incomparably more threatening to humans than the CO2 they emit into the atmosphere.

On account of the booming political campaign for government control of carbon compounds, understanding the consequences of atmospheric CO2 and the human involvement in it is a matter of some urgency for the public welfare. While the climate effects, if any, are imperceptible at present, precautionary or preemptive political reaction already in evidence is producing adverse economic consequences, such as misuse of resources and misapplication of capital. Consider the diversion of agricultural enterprise from foodstuff to motor-fuel production at the behest of public relations and taxpayers' subsidies. Government-sponsored production of boutique alternative motor fuel (ethanol) has already resulted in doubling the price of milk and corn tortillas. Hamburgers and hot dogs are next.

To put human culpability for the weather into perspective requires first taking an inventory of all CO2 emissions and consumptions, natural and man-made. This is a task that is not only difficult but controversial. Next is required a full explanation of the greenhouse effect, its relative importance in global climate and the relative importance of the various gaseous constituents of the atmosphere in the phenomenon. Then, the question as to where the greenhouse effect ranks in significance among all the other phenomena that possibly influence global climate must be answered. Finally, the relative importance of geological, meteorological, solar and cosmic effects in global climate formation must be ascertained. Note that none of the latter has an anthropogenic component. In a previous article, I briefly examined the physics of global climate formation and casually surveyed the various phenomena known to be at play in its outcome. Thereby, I hoped to identify any significant anthropogenic influence in the matter and to advance (at least my own) understanding of what has become a major controversy in human affairs. This publication exercise was good for me, but response to the article indicated that not all readers were similarly gratified. I opened my previous essay with this outrageous statement: ""In 1991, the volcanic eruption at Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines put more carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere than did the whole human race during the most recent century of the industrial era."" This statement provoked queries from several thoughtful readers asking for sources, which proves LewRockwell.com readers are paying attention. Thus prompted, I proceeded to examine the Pinatubo event more carefully. I found an authoritative report on the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo event, which estimated this eruption put 921 megatons of H2O vapor and 234 megatons of CO2 gas into the atmosphere. If so, Pinatubo emitted in a matter of days about 1% of the CO2 emitted by the whole human race in the year 2003.

Another Pinatubo eruption source states the following:

The University of Rochester physicists who conducted the study ”determined the volcano climate sensitivity and response time for the Mount Pinatubo eruption, using observational measurements of the temperature anomalies of the lower troposphere, measurements of the long wave outgoing radiation, and the aerosol optical density,” perhaps inspired by what Hansen et al. (1992) had said of this eruption, i.e., that it had the potential to exceed “the accumulated forcing due to all anthropogenic greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere since the industrial revolution began,” and should “provide an acid test for global climate models.” Thus, when the water emitted is taken into account, the total contribution to the Earth's greenhouse cover by this one volcanic event justifies my previous claim. Nevertheless, temporary Earth cooling was the outcome of Pinatubo 1991. Whatever human activity contributed to the Earth's greenhouse that year, it was eclipsed by Pinatubo's other effects for a good while thereafter. Another treatment of volcanic CO2 emissions found that 30 billion metric tons of CO2 was being emitted every year from Mount Etna alone as of the late 1980’s. This research also estimates the current emissions from all volcanic sources (including geothermal) at 264 billion metric tons CO2 per year. These emissions were found to be in equilibrium with the ground. Specifically, the CO2 emitted into the atmospheric is being absorbed in the soil and oceans at a comparable rate by silicate weathering and alkali buffering. Apparently, volcanic activity may well be emitting an order of magnitude more CO2 than human activity per annum without any exceptional eruptions like Pinatubo.

Volcanic activity includes geysers, mostly geothermal types. Some geysers are actually carbon dioxidedriven, cold water geysers. Many are submarine and uncharted, but could account for certain vertical convection currents in the oceans that alter the local CO2 distribution.

Although rarely found in media coverage, which concentrates lately on human culpability and original sin, there exists a considerable cache of actual data on the CO2 in volcanic eruptions. A geologist responding to my previous article expressed surprise that volcanists don’t publish more on this subject under the circumstances. He also thinks the climatologists should be more concerned than they apparently are with the effects of volcanic activity on the atmospheric inventory of CO2 because of the potential for the volatilization of huge volumes of CO2 from mineral carbonate in the crust of the Earth.

However, climatologists have reason to neglect CO2 emissions. In spite of what the alarmists say, the greenhouse effect of CO2 is not that important in global climate formation. 100 ppm (0.01%) more CO2 in the atmosphere over a hundred years may be a lot of aerial fertilizer, but it is probably negligible as a weather-maker. Too bad it probably won’t produce some warming, which would be welcomed by most humans, plants and animals. Apparently, volcanic activity has a significant influence on the Earth's climate. It is also apparent that humans don't. Volcanic exhausts have enormous potential as a source of atmospheric CO2. The volumes may actually be greater than I represented in my earlier article. The reason for this is that volcanoes volatilize tremendous amounts of mineral carbon and carbonates residing in the Earth’s crust. The potential atmospheric CO2 is far greater from volcanic sources than from forest and brush fires, which in turn is greater than from human fuel burning.

It is estimated that 2 billion tons of CO2 are emitted annually from drained and burning peat lands in Indonesia. About 80% of this is from peat land fires and 20% is from the decay of drained and drying peat swamps. This amount of CO2 entering the atmosphere, about a tenth of what human industrial and agricultural activities produce, raises the question as to how much of the Earth's total is coming from forest and brush fires, and how much of that is caused by arson versus nature (lightning)?

As of a couple of years ago, anthropogenic CO2 emissions were estimated at 26 billion metric tons per year. If so, human CO2 emissions are about 10% of volcanic CO2 emissions. And then there are previously mentioned forest and brush fires to account for. Accordingly, human emissions of CO2 at present are somewhat less than 10% of the total.

In any event, all these carbon emissions are balanced by the natural, on-going CO2 uptake and sequestration in vegetation, soil weathering and dissolution in rain, lakes, rivers and oceans. An increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere increases the rate of these absorptions. As a result, ambient CO2 dissolution is a significant buffer on the increase of atmospheric CO2 from increases in CO2 emissions from whatever source. Thus, most CO2 emissions never enter the greenhouse to affect the climate.

It has come to pass that CO2 emissions are popularly believed to be cooking the life out of the planet via the greenhouse effect. It is widely believed that humans are responsible for this global climate change because they put the culprit CO2 to the atmosphere. Since few people know anything about CO2 (most don't even know what it is or how it creates a greenhouse effect), how were they convinced CO2 in the atmosphere can play such a significant role in global climate formation via a greenhouse effect? Did they ever consider the possibility the more ubiquitous water vapor in the atmosphere (humidity) might be a more important greenhouse gas than CO2?

Attempts to forecast the future climate on Earth by mathematical modeling and computer simulation are doomed unless they account for the water in the atmosphere. They may be doomed even if they do because of the uncertainty in the data and kinetics. Water is not only an independent factor but it almost always accompanies CO2 emissions (e.g. hydrocarbon combustion, respiration, etc.). Water is more prevalent and far more significant than CO2 in radiation interchange with the sun. Water not only absorbs solar radiation but also condenses to form clouds that reflect and scatter the sunshine The cooling effects of this radiative scattering utterly counteracts the heating by radiation absorption in the greenhouse effect. But the scattering is a much more complex phenomenon, an anathema to mathematical modelers.

The overwhelming importance of water in the formation of global climate is the inconvenient truth ignored by the environmental lobbyists and propagandists. In their fixation on CO2, they claim to represent the findings of a preponderance of scientists  indeed a consensus — on what computer models say about the Earth's climate. The activists don't know any better — they can claim innocence by virtue of ignorance. However, the modelers, who have neglected the role of water in the atmosphere, should know better. But in grazing for funding to support their research budgets, they pander to those who can influence the public outlays. Oblivious to such matters, the alarmists blithely represent the findings of the technical authorities to the political authorities as unimpeachable, and that their conclusions somehow ratified as if by plebiscite, support urgent political measures, which they (the activists) are ready, willing and able to deliver in terms of a public stampede for protection from nebulous harm.

Who constructed the computer models? Modelers. The modelers masquerade as the highly credentialed academics they usually are, sequestered as they usually are with their super-computers in government laboratories and in university laboratories funded by the government. Their mission is to create a mathematical surrogate of real world climate and advise their clients regarding the formulation of appropriate public policies as if government can do something about the climate. The truth is, the government is powerless to do anything about the global climate and the computer expertise involved is more relevant to games, animated cartoons and other graphical forms of juvenile amusement.

The difficulty of modeling the climate of the whole earth for the purpose of making long-term predictions with sufficient confidence to regiment human life is highlighted by the fact that the big-budget meteorologists can’t even forecast the weather in Los Angeles a week from now, let alone the winds aloft over the poles at the end of the century. Such modeling may be the most complicated problem ever contemplated by man. Even global climate data summaries (compilations of simple facts) over-simplify the modeling problem.

Typically, and most discrediting, modelers neglect water in the greenhouse gas inventory. Also, they count only the readily observable “anthropogenic” sources of CO2, albeit footnoted to the effect that the natural sources, while possibly large, are too uncertain and difficult to ascertain. Yet, the researchers blithely persevere while timidly admitting that the natural sources are probably well over ten times the anthropogenic ones.

The modelers' results have been used to alarm the public over the future of the planet as a suitable human habitat. Such alarm is out of all proportion to the scientific credibility of those results. The modelers focus on human CO2 emissions and greenhouse calculations virtually in isolation from other climate influences. Such concentration is more appropriate to a forensic investigation than basic climate research. Whereas basic scientific research seeks to extend the bounds of human knowledge of the natural world as it is, forensic science seeks to find fault for injury to build a cases against the culpable. Forensic science (often shortened to forensics) is the application of a broad spectrum of sciences to answer questions of interest to the legal system in relation to a crime or to a civil action. It is not a dispassionate knowledge-finding endeavor.

Whereas a narrow focus on the simple radiative greenhouse effect facilitates mathematical modeling, the truth is that blackbody radiation interchange between the sun and the atmosphere is dominated by the scattering effects of particles  dust, smoke, water droplets, sulfates and other aerosols. Model that!!

It seems the modelers have been hired to build a case against affluent human life as a cause for political action. But who is the client? Who is the plaintiff? Who is picking up the tab? Taxpayers, who else. Do they have a cause of action against themselves? No. But there are no lucrative political careers without taxpayers, who are the resourceful and productive people that can be fooled and shamed for their very industry. It doesn’t matter if there is actually a crime that can be measured. So much the better for the politically ambitious if it can’t. And if the affluent can't pay, who can? It appears the alarm over human industrial emission of CO2 is a political red herring in a wild goose chase to gain and exercise political power. It is an old story: create public panic over an imaginary threat to justify a futile and senseless campaign that amounts to the conquest of the population. In the case at hand, strap the public to a carbon abatement campaign and you have permanent conquest. This campaign to stampede the public is reminiscent of a long line of other prohibition movements (e.g. booze, drugs, prostitution, etc.). All are doomed to messy failure.

Regardless, it is never too late to learn as long as you are alive. For starters, get your facts straight. Google makes it easy as never before. Hunt for CO2 sources as a means to help put human life on Earth into a proper perspective. But get more out of your CO2 emissions while you are at it, and don't forget about the water.

Reducing CO2 emissions is an admirable strategy for improving the efficiency and cost of living. For example, getting better mileage from the fuel you burn will not only reduce your CO2 emissions but your driving costs. Improving conventional power plant thermal efficiency reduces CO2 and consumer electricity cost and conserves natural resources in the bargain. But none of this is relevant to global climate change. Although such emissions enhance the so-called greenhouse phenomenon, they do not represent a threat to human life from changes in the Earth's climate.

What is threatening to human life on the planet is the public panic over a hyped-up threat from nature supposedly caused by human emissions of CO2 as a consequence of the good life. Man insults Mother Nature. Mother Nature strikes back. How does She do this? She empowers some politicians to shame the sheepish and stampede the guilty for protection. Protection is the government's racket. The racket du jour is mandatory CO2 emission control, which amounts to rationing industry and the society it serves.

Arbitrary reductions in CO2 emissions that are not matched by thermal efficiency gains signify a decline in viability. Taken to the limit would result in all entropy and no work, a consequence of Clausius’ Second Law of Thermodynamics. Philosophers and apocalyptics fanaticize this outcome as the red death of the planet. Society is immortal only to the extent there are improvements in power generation and transportation propulsion technology. Humans can and do control their CO2 emissions to this end.

CAN HUMANS CONTROL GLOBAL CLIMATE? No. Not even by controlling their emissions of CO2. The best they can do is to inform themselves and to act in self-defense according to their best judgment of the situation as they find it, using the most appropriate technological means at hand.

224559,"In Latin ""redux"" means to be brought back or revisited and I fear we are getting ready for another war started once again by an unprovoked attack against peaceful US forces. Dictatorships can attack other nations at will because their controlled citizenry well understand they have no say in the matter and thus the government has little need to justify their military actions.

But for democracies where much of the ignorant public often blindly follow the media establishment propaganda and foolishly believe they can have an impact or even ""laughingly"" control their leaders or representative bodies instead of powerful special interests, another step is always necessary to guarantee public support.

A false flag operation usually happens at just the right time but it is never ordered by the democracy or empire leaders going to war as they must always be protected by ""plausible deniability."" This denial of blame at the top is assured when higher leadership levels quarantine the blame to the lower levels and these are often inaccessible, which makes confirming responsibility for the action nearly impossible. This protects a nation’s leadership should the illegal or disreputable and unpopular activities become public thus allowing the top leadership to truthfully deny any awareness of such act or any connection to the agents used to carry out such acts.

Democracies often require a potential adversary to commit a violent action and pretext to generate the necessary public support to begin and justify the war and retaliation. It is important to condition the public for major long-term wars on the necessity for the blood sacrifice, economic costs, wealth confiscation required to fund the war and severe controls on media, communications and neutralize any bygone concern about personal rights and liberties. In the past with almost total control of news and opinion by the establishment media, this was a simple process but today with a powerful alternative Internet based media, their propaganda job is far more difficult.

Americans for some unknown reasons have always had a curious fascination and weakness for wars often started by false flag operations, real enemy attacks or deliberate provocations involving water, ships and harbors. From the World Trade Towers downed on the edge of New York Harbor, to the Gulf of Tonkin attack, to Pearl Harbor, to the sinking of the Lusitania passenger ship secretly carrying over 4 million rounds of ammunition bringing the US into World War One were all water based. As was the battleship Maine, blown up in Havana, Cuba starting the Spanish-American War and of course the Confederate batteries bombarding Fort Sumter in Charleston where only a horse was killed but the establishment press created a war hysteria which ultimately caused the deaths of 600,000 Americans north and south.

False Flag operations are usually covert operations which are designed to deceive the public in such a way that the operations appear as though they are being carried out by other entities. Sometimes the operation has little or nothing to do with the nation needing to wage war and in the case of the need for justification for an air assault and invasion of Iran, there is a real lineup of nations and terrorist groups which would benefit from a new war in the Middle East.

First, the Iranian leadership believes they can survive a bombing of their nuclear facilities and then declare victory thus strengthening the regime in power from domestic opposition and giving Shia minorities around the region reason to support Iran. Israel has real concerns about Iran’s nuclear ambitions and no Israeli government would survive an announcement that Iran had developed nuclear weapons on their watch hence real domestic political reasons for an air assault. Saudi Arabia governed by a Sunni majority is the political leadership and nation most threatened by a Shia Iran and they desperately want the US or Israel to attack Iran.

Therefore how will the war likely start? The US Navy has positioned the Harry S. Truman (CVAN-75), a super carrier near the coast just offshore from Iran’s naval commando units while the other carriers are positioned further out and away from the mainland. Any nation, black ops unit or rogue elements from Iran, Israel, Saudi Arabia, other terrorist groups or even the US could easily attack carrier Truman and the entire world would immediately assume the government of Iran was behind the attack.

The immediacy of communications and video today means an international incident and cause for retaliation and war could result from just a single missile or torpedo attack with substantial smoke, some damage and a few causalities and wounded. The carrier does not need to sink nor suffer severe loss of lives to start the beginning of a major war in the Middle East.

For the Washington establishment, much of our population would be seduced by the media manufacturing a frenzy of outrage, calls for revenge and super patriotism to help the public forget about the double-dip recession/depression, support bringing back the draft, substantially higher taxes and wealth confiscation plus ""temporary war emergency"" regulations curtailing the opposition internet press and views. A major war would also help silence those of us who warn about the Fed, fiat money and the ballooning national debt and unfunded liabilities as unpatriotic and security risks all the while the elites can blame all of the economic problems they created and wealth and liberties they will have stolen on the Iranian War.

Don’t say this can’t happen here because a close review of our history shows this is the norm rather than the exception when war is necessary for the survival and expansion of the Washington Empire. I hope freedom-loving Americans will wake up to this real risk or else get in practice shouting ""Remember the Truman"" when our wealth is taken, remaining freedoms curtailed and our sons and daughters are marched off to the Third World War in the Middle East.

Hoping I’m wrong on this.

You may say I’m a dreamer, But I’m not the only one. I hope some day you’ll join us, And the world will be as one. .

If you like these lyrics, you’re most likely to be young, progressive and/or a Westerner. A video of the song begins with John and Yoko walking through a misty woods towards an elegant mansion. Above the door, there’s a sign, “THERE IS NO HERE,” a clear reference to Thomas More’s Utopia, which literally means “no place.” Whereas More was being satirical, Lennon sang “Imagine” quite earnestly, and his admirers see it as an ideal. Considering how things are going in the West, they feel closer to this goal of having no countries than ever. Borders are bad, and nationalism is just another word for Fascism, they believe.

Ensconced in his sumptuous Tittenhurst Park estate, Lennon crooned, “Imagine no possessions. I wonder if you can.” No, I can’t, John. Mi casa es tu casa is just a figure of speech, amigo. Interviewed by National Public Radio in 2006, Jimmy Carter actually claimed, “And of course, as you know, in many countries around the world—my wife and I have visited about 125 countries—you hear John Lennon’s song ‘Imagine’ used almost equally with national anthems.”

Time to buy old US gold coins

There is a 2004 film, It’ll Never Last, that’s about three British women with foreign husbands. Aristocratic Alexandra Tolstoy fell in love with a Muslim horseman while on a ten-month trip along the Silk Road. After the wedding, she moved into his grim, Soviet-era apartment on the outskirts of Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

Patricia from Belfast married Tiziano and moved to Rimini, Italy.

Oxford-graduate Gemma Burford married a Massai warrior and moved into a rural house without running water or electricity in Tanzania.

If differences between countries were merely cosmetic and trivial, for we’re all the same, after all, these women should have been able to adjust well enough to their new environments, but none of these marriages lasted, and the first one to call it quit, even before the film ended, was Patricia. One might think that this is rather surprisingly, for she didn’t move into that foreign a culture, but of course all societies are alien to any other, and that’s why we have 196 countries, with each subdivided even further. Just as Idaho is not Mississippi, your average Bavarian wouldn’t want to move to Saxony.

Language isn’t just communication but a shared heritage, so if you can’t quite master a new tongue, you don’t quite belong in that community. At her wedding, Patricia pronounced anello [ring] as agnello [lamb], which cracked up the entire church, then at home, Tiziano started to carp about her cooking, and after dinner, he would go to his mama’s house for coffee and only return around 11.

Patricia had become drawn to Italians through the movies, “If I watched a foreign film or something, I liked the tall, dark man with the dark eyes, like Italian people. I just liked someone who was different from myself.” After the breakup, she reflected, “When I look at my wedding video, I just think I was so stupid, so very stupid. So naive.”

Tolstoy could talk to her man in Russian, and she swooned over his boldness, fearlessness and how he rode, so erect and shirtless, on a mare. Shamil also knew Alexandra was destined for him, “For example, I can tell straight away if a horse is right for me.” Bucking the Uzbek just five years later, this perfect horse is now shacked up with Sergei Pugachev, a Russian tycoon. They spend most of their time on the French Riviera.

Tolstoy claims that Putin wants to kill both her and Pugachev, while the Russian government has charged the former banker and shipyard owner with embezzlement. Sheltering Pugachev, France won’t turn him over, however, just as Russia won’t let Uncle Sam snatch Edward Snowden. Countries will always disagree, of course. Nine men, ten opinions. Before the Chinese dissident Liu Xiabo died in custody, Germany had offered him asylum.

Gemma Burford and her Masai beau, Lesikar, fell in love without even a common language, and there were other obstacles, such as the Masai tradition of polygamy. Filmed with several flies buzzing or landing on his face, Lesikar’s dad explained, “I spoke with Gemma’s parents. I said to them I would only agree to the marriage if Gemma would accept the possibility of Lesikar taking another wife.”

For his part, Lesikar was convinced he had found a right mate, “Finding a good wife is as hard as finding good cattle. It’s a matter of luck.”

Gemma’s affable dad recounted his first visit to Tanzania, “That trip was an eye opener. Up to the village, it was horrific, to be honest.” Then, “Most countries, you can talk about things, and people will know what you’re talking about, but there, of course, there was very little you could talk about that you had a common knowledge of, let alone a common interest.”

Still, Mr. Burford came round to embracing his son-in-law, thanks in part to Lesikar’s visit to England, “When he came over, he came dressed as a Masai warrior, with his blankets and his shoes, which are made out of rubber tires, and he also had his great, big 14-inch knife that he had at his side.

“Once he settled in at home, he was fine. The problem comes in trying to feed him. He only eats beef and lamb or goat. They don’t eat anything else. They eat vegetables. They don’t eat any sweet things. They don’t have cakes or anything.

“We were quite surprised at how quickly he picked up things, how bright he was. The thing that strikes you with Lesikar is his smile. The room lights up when Lesikar smiles. Everyone falls for that. He really is a very nice chap, but also very intelligent, we’re beginning to find.”

Lesikar, “The things I missed most were my cows and my family. I didn’t like the food. Although my mother-in-law tried very, very hard to make it tasty, the meat tasted like paper.”

Lesikar was glad to return to his Masai ways, with Gemma joining him. Without resolving the polygamy issue, they wedded after she got pregnant. There is a scene of her doing laundry outside, using a plastic tub, “Yeah, I do feel at home here. I don’t feel as at home here as I want to. I think the more I live here, the more I will feel at home here […] A lot of people say it all the time, and even here, they say, ‘Ah, you’ll never cope, you’ll never cope.’ Just watch me. OK, I’ll put you on the guest list for our silver wedding, God willing.”

Gemma’s dad had a concern, “I think the one thing with the difference in culture is the worry that the women are regarded, not inferior, but they have their jobs, and the men have their jobs, and the women’s jobs are all the manual work, and the men’s job is thinking and drinking, and I can’t see Gemma settling for that.”

After giving birth to a daughter, Gemma had to confront the issue of female circumcision, “At the moment, there is no other way… for a girl to become a woman. They believe you can’t have a healthy child if you haven’t been circumcised.”

They moved to Arusha, a city of 400,000, and founded a safari business, but the marriage collapsed in 2010, with Lesikar returning to his family and cows. Gemma wrote in 2017, “Lesikar has moved on and had more children, although he hasn’t quite equalled his father’s record yet.” In the film, Lesikar stated, “I am one of nineteen children. Sorry, I mean seventeen.”

Each of us is already a nationalist via our infinity of affinities. Just as Lesikar belongs to the Masai nation, Gemma has reverted to being an English woman, for she has moved back to the UK with her two daughters.

By marrying and moving into another culture, the women of It’ll Never Last tried their best to join another nation, and their failure to do so illustrates, rather gloriously, that mankind is still diverse. Our differences don’t just reflect our ideals but define our autonomy.

Far from promising peace, those who sing of no countries are really threatening us all with unspeakable violence, psychic and physical.

An empire, by nature, must trample on nationhood, even its own, for it presents the empire’s ambitions as the nation’s necessities, for how else can you get Americans, for example, to go die and fight in Afghanistan or Iraq? Though citing love of nation constantly, our Washington rulers are essentially anti-American, and that’s why a genuine nationalist like Edward Snowden must flee to Russia.

Nationalism is simply the love of one’s language, culture, history and heritage, one’s very identity in short, but as wielded by an empire, nationalism becomes a murderous tool to violate one nation after another. The American empire is destroying the American nation.

218543,"Why do Americans who talk about freedom and democracy rely on coercion?

The political left is all for coercion against the rich. Freedom and democracy mean taking the rich’s money and giving it to those who have a ""right"" to it.

For conservatives, freedom and democracy issue forth from the barrels of our guns. National Review’s cover (May 3) proclaims: ""To the Death, Crushing the insurgency, saving Iraq."" The magazine’s conservative editors are too serious to see the irony, but polls show that Americans are appalled at the growing carnage.

An April 28 CBS/New York Times poll found ""just 32%, the lowest number ever, say Iraq was a threat that required immediate military action a year ago."" A majority of Americans now say the invasion was a mistake.

I remember when conservatives complained about people like Hitler and Stalin, who were good at crushing people. Now conservatives have the spirit themselves.

In a series of articles in the May 3 issue, National Review’s writers show off their new face. Leading off with his plan for gaining legitimacy in Iraq, John O’Sullivan writes:

""Our first tasks now must be to crush the rebellions, punish the al-Sadr types, and disband the militias. Ceasefires must be conducted in ways that dispel any impression of weakness. If threats are made — like the threat to kill or capture al-Sadr — they must be carried out. In general the U.S. must not only win but also be seen to win.""

All this bloodshed, however, is insufficient to solve ""the underlying problem,"" which is, O’Sullivan writes, ""that Iraq is too divided to be a fully sovereign democracy."" Solving that problem will require ""several decades"" as a US colony, and ""during this long period the most important politician in Iraq will be the US ambassador.""

How many Iraqis would be left after decades of being killed and crushed? Not to worry. In the next article, David Pryce-Jones writes: ""For as long as anyone can remember, Iraq has been in the hands of some thug whose will is the only law."" Having rid Iraq of Saddam Hussein, the secret of success is to retain his methods. In the hands of our thugs, Iraqis are better off, Pryce-Jones writes, because we have good intentions for crushing them.

To achieve our good intentions, however, we have ""no choice except to work through the custom inherent in absolute rule. "" What is this custom? Pryce-Jones’ answer: ""Superior and exemplary force alone can prove that the political and military leadership of the coalition has confidence in its goals, and the strength to carry them through.""

""Liberals in the West,"" complains Pryce-Jones, object to the proper way of handling our new colonial subjects, because liberals are ""ignorant about the harsh imperatives of absolutism."" To help liberals understand that the harsh imperatives of absolutism lead to freedom and democracy, Pryce-Jones quotes the great admirer of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville, who advised French officers in the front line in Algeria in 1841: ""Only force and terror, my dear sirs, work with those [Muslim] fellows.""

As for al-Sadr, writes Pryce-Jones, the US should take its cue from Stalin: ""No man, no problem."" We must do no less than Saddam Hussein, who ""would have arrested Moqtada al-Sadr and shot him, as he shot the ayatollah’s father and other members of the family."" For goodness sake, Pryce-Jones exclaims, we mustn’t sit around and let ""those seeking power"" [not us of course] ""believe that victory is theirs for the taking"" just because we don’t exercise the harsh imperatives of absolutism. Don’t Americans understand that the ends justify the means?

Next, Michael Rubin assures the faint-hearted that Iraqis want the US to be forceful like Saddam Hussein and stop acting like wimps. The Iraqi people don’t want American troops to leave, he claims. Iraqis are upset with us ""because American calls for more UN involvement or for outright withdrawal do little but project weakness."" Iraqis, Rubin tells us, ""watch with disbelief"" as we project weakness instead of acting like men and exercising the harsh imperatives of absolutism.

Richard Lowry writes that the US need not worry, because we have ""the Marines who will fight in Fallujah and elsewhere in Iraq."" Unlike weak-kneed politicians, Marines aren’t afflicted with doubts, because Marines accept ""an absolute and unquestioning submission to authority"" and can be relied on to do as they are told.

Lowry sees the Borg as the conservative future. He romanticizes the training process, which teaches an 18-year old kid to speak of himself in the third person and turns him into an automaton whose identity becomes the unit.

UN Secretary General Kofi Annan disagrees with National Review’s plan. He says, ""Violent military action by an occupying power against inhabitants of an occupied country will only make matters worse."" Obviously, Annan doesn’t understand the harsh imperatives of absolutism, which is why the UN must be kept out of the picture.

The Bush administration maintains that the only Iraqis who oppose our occupation are ""thugs and criminals."" According to a new USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll, that is most of Iraq: 71% of Iraqis see the US as an occupier (81% if Kurds are excluded), not as a liberator, and the majority want us to leave.

372268,"Theres something a bit embarrassing about other peoples love letters. Like glimpsing lovers in an embrace, its an insight into human nature at its most elevated, or its basest. And it is, like passing a road accident, almost impossible not to peek.

This is how I felt when I saw that Elizabeth Taylor was allowing the publication of her love letters from Richard Burton. Its not hard to see why she would do it (although his widow Sally Hay Burton might disagree); Burtons language is poetic and magnificent.

Who couldnt feel stirred by his protestations that I am forever punished by the gods for being given the fire and trying to put it out. The fire, of course, is you. Its like one of their film scripts brought to life.

When he fumes we operate on alien wavelengths. You are as distant as Venus  planet, I mean  and I am tone deaf to the music of the spheres, we see the whole of the male-female conundrum laid bare (and, more importantly, a whole generation of self-help books).

But there is also, in the Burton-Taylor correspondence, as the young people put it: TMI. Too Much Information. When I think of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, I want to think of an epic, tumultuous love between two people more vibrantly sexual and passionate than nature had a right to make them. I do not want to hear that in private he called the violet-eyed screen goddess My Lumps or Dearest Scrupelshrumpilstilskin. Or even that he signed himself off with the tediously suburban: Husbs.

Because epic romance relies on what remains hidden. It cannot survive the revelation of the domestic, or the mundane. Walter Bagehot said of the monarchy that mystery is its life. We must not let daylight in upon magic."" I think I speak for all of us when I say I would have been quite happy had daylight not fallen upon Prince Charless exchange with Camilla Parker Bowles in which, amongst other things, he professed a wish to be reincarnated as her knickers. (Or indeed, her response You could come back as a box of Tampax so you could just keep going.) Yes, its earthy, and one might almost call it endearing. But actually, as the young people also also put it, ewww.

The elevation of statesmen, like royalty and movie stars, relies on an inherent belief that they are somehow closer to God. The revelation of their mortality, with its neediness, pet names and fixation on underwear, is somehow more shocking than if we had heard the same of our neighbour.

US Governor Mark Sanfords political career  and marriage  never recovered last year after details of his intimate correspondence to a mistress were made public. It wasnt his infidelity that made him a laughing stock. It was the breathtaking cheesiness of his prose. I could say that I [ ] love the curve of your hips, the erotic beauty of you holding yourself (or two magnificent parts of yourself) in the faded glow of the nights light  but hey, that would be going into sexual details  manages to combine schoolboy smuttiness with the language of a priapic travelling salesman.

In another missive to Maria, he tells of something wonderful about listening to country music playing in the cab, air conditioner running, the hum of a huge diesel engine in the background. Oh, Mark, theres nothing that gets a girl going like the hum of plant machinery.

If Lloyd Georges endearments to mistress Frances Stevenson  My darling Pussy. You might phone on Friday if you can come. Dont let Hankey see you  had been made similarly public, would he have maintained his own reputation as a towering statesman?

The publication of private messages of endearment is a dangerous strategy at best, and at worst a terrible betrayal. Last year James Albright, one of Madonnas former lovers, put her love letters up for sale (bet the girls are lining up to put pen to paper for Mr Albright these days). Madonna is no wilting flower. But I cant think she was delighted to have broadcast her habit of signing intimate correspondence Lil Booty.

How did it come into existence if it didn’t develop as a good with uses other than money? Today we observe persistent thievery of goods (e.g. land, cars, gold, and silver) by the state. Individuals are often on the lookout for mechanisms that reduce the chance that their property will be forcefully appropriated. The possible reduction of state theft risk is one of the main selling points of Bitcoin.

Money has historically been a tangible good that was desired by people on its own merits as a good. Salt had uses and could be traded and divided and lasts longer than a chicken. Eventually, the link to a good was lost as pieces of paper with no connection to anything prevailed when the state had its way – via legal tender laws – at concocting new and improved methods of theft via inflation and banking cronyism.

In the 1990s, I remember seeing little deed certificates for micro-acres of ranch land that could be traded like money. That concept seems like it might be a workable idea for money if you don’t consider the state factor. What if the state doesn’t like the idea of mini paper titles to ownership of micro-acres of a large Texas ranch? The state can steal the whole ranch. Or, the state can add a new confiscatory tax to the land that varies vastly from the original agricultural tax scheme thereby reducing the exchange value of the asset-connected paper deeds. The state can proclaim the whole idea to be a money-laundering operation. The state can see the link to something tangible and seize all the assets pertaining to the persons who implemented the idea as was done with the Liberty Dollar which had a connection to real precious metals redeemable on demand.

So, if Bitcoin didn’t follow the normal route for money origination as a good in the market, why did it develop and can it survive in a free market?

The principle marketed features of Bitcoin are its limited supply and its resistance to state predation when being held and transferred. The limited supply is a mathematical reality. That, plus the hoped-for resistance to state thievery supposedly overcome the fact that it didn’t originate as a good on the market. It has no link to something real that can be taxed, seized, or plundered. But does this benefit really overcome its non-good status?

Prison Economics

Rothbard Check Amazon for Pricing. concentration camp, but such a device – devised and utilized to get around a state-caused hardship – would probably not survive with its original state-caused value intact when, and if, the economy reverts to a free market because of the extra cost involved in shaping food into thin cylindrical packages. The exchanged value of an item whose primary beneficial feature is state avoidance would be lower in a freer society than an innovation whose primary value is to serve the other preferences of a freer people. Such a weird-shaped food is not an outgrowth of an entrepreneur’s efforts to satisfy the free market preferences of people outside of state confines. It is an innovation to circumvent state predation. If the suffering imposed by the state is ever lifted or escaped from, the anti-state innovation has less utility and less desirability than an innovation inspired by the desire to enhance the exchanges of value and the lifestyle of a freer people.

Medical tourism to foreign countries may be a booming business during a time – like our present time – when the state is restricting the free market for medical services in the U.S., but would that mechanism be a big success if you lived in an area and in a time that had an unhindered free market for medical services?

Some things develop in a time and place because of horrendous state intrusions into or restrictions on the free market. But if liberty prevails in the future in that area, will the state- circumventing innovations survive if that is one of their primary claims to value? Would they be needed and desired and valued if there was more freedom?

Bitcoin is Anti-State Money and State-Caused Money

Bitcoin’s coming into prominence was mainly due to a desire to avoid confiscation, tracking, and inflation; all things that are hallmarks of the state’s dedication to the principle of stealing value from you. It has the benefit of being something with no link to something real that can be confiscated. So, Bitcoin has the ironic dual honor of being anti-state money and state-caused money. The anti-state aspect is one of its main claims to fame. The innovations that may possibly circumvent the state’s main methods of taking value are Amazon.com Gift Card i... Check Amazon for Pricing. considered to be its main features. The fact that it is devoid of any tangible value is portrayed as a good thing in a statist environment. Gold’s primary claim to fame isn’t a claimed ability to avoid theft, tracking, or inflation although its high value-to-size ratio and relative scarcity assist with those things.

Without state predations, adaptations to avoid those predations possess less utility, less desirability, and possibly no value at all; especially, as in the case of Bitcoin, when there never was any tangible value.

Will There Never be Freedom?

So, could Bitcoin survive in an unhindered free market even if it is largely a state-caused medium of exchange that has no status as a commodity good? Would an alternative that was related to a good be preferred by users if there was no state predation or reduced state predation? And, is it logical to assume that the level of state predation will never go down? Will state theft risk be so pervasive in most every transaction or savings action from now into eternity that the lack of connection to anything seizable in a purely virtual money will be the paramount consideration from now on over actual value offered by a tradable money that is also a saleable, usable, tangible commodity?

Virtual currencies are an interesting idea. But, if they lack an inherent connection to the tangible world, a doubt is created about their value and there will be similar assumed-value pitfalls as exist with supposed “intellectual property” which also has no claim on anything tangible. One or more currencies with a “virtual” aspect may persist and survive. Only the market will determine that. The real long-term test, however, may be their ability to pass over into a freer society without a big loss of value.

I am optimistic that freedom will prevail, if not universally, then at least in pockets competing against the state to which people will migrate so as to preserve their wealth and personal freedom. In those pockets of relatively higher freedom, the thin, cylindrical, labor-intensive prison food packages would probably fetch a lower price than real ham sandwiches or real pizzas. They would likely be competed out of existence. People would probably eat normal food and rarely invest resources into squishing it into odd, thin, narrow, “state-caused” tubes that would be required when passing it through a secretive conduit in a state-imposed wall. Innovations that get around state-imposed harms are good things, but would they be preferred and exist otherwise without other features?

To go a bit further, is Bitcoin really the equivalent of a squished-up ham sandwich? Bitcoins don’t actually contain any ham. They are claims that a person hopes to trade – though they represent nothing tangible – for a ham sandwich. The hope is that the ham sandwich trader will perceive the risk of state theft also and agree to hold value in nothingness, so that his value can’t be stolen by vigilant Leviathan during the process of storing and transferring wealth used to buy and sell ham sandwiches. So, there needs to be a universally accepted disconnect of tangible value during transactions and between transactions (savings) in order for bitcoin to be viable in the long term. An understood suspension of real goods-for-goods must happen every time a money transaction occurs, with pretty much the sole intent being of avoiding state predations that may intervene in those transactions. And this doesn’t even address the issue of whether Bitcoin is really immune to state plunder.

So, can real capital be moved in a stable manner between people and across generations this way? Real ham sandwiches cannot be received by a starving inmate through a hole in a prison wall in this manner. Can a secret number passed through the hole in the wall be traded inside the concentration camp to other prisoners for ham sandwiches? Possibly, for a while, if everyone agrees in that context that secret numbers not originating with any otherwise usable traits equate to ham sandwiches, but a prisoner that has access to a friend on the outside who can smuggle in real things, for example eggs, will probably get more ham sandwiches in exchange for his real contraband items since the real things meet tangible preferences and represent the free market breaking into the restricted statist market.

So, if state seizure action is partly or completely negated in a freer society – thereby degrading the value of Bitcoin – the only other value left to Bitcoin is the limitation on its supply.

Robinson and Friday Try a Trendy Limited Supply Virtual Money

On that point, here is a little thought experiment involving Robinson Crusoe and Friday on an island. Assume that the two live in a voluntary society with each other and, consequently, all exchanges are mutually agreed upon and maximize value from the viewpoint of each party. They decide to use a trendy virtual currency instead of salt which they previously used. They choose an agreed-upon finite number of planets as their currency. They agree that no new planets can ever be added to the money supply even if more are detected. They decide that their money supply will consist of eight planets. They both like Pluto as a planet, but they decide to not use it so that they can each start out with an even number of planets; four and four. They like the idea that their medium of exchange has a limited supply and that a state, if one should ever descend upon them, would not be able to pluck the virtual planets out of their brains.

One day, on the verge of the short tropical winter, Robinson notices that Friday has accumulated a lot of macadamia nuts. Robinson had been concentrating more on bananas. Robinson proposes to Friday that he will exchange half of Jupiter for ten pounds of macadamia nuts. Friday declines the offer. Then Robinson offers all of Jupiter for ten pounds of macadamia nuts. Friday declines again. Then, Robinson offers all of his planets for any amount of macadamia nuts. Friday declines, but proposes that he will exchange macadamia nuts to Robinson at the rate of three nuts for every banana that Robinson gives him. Friday reminds Robinson that winter is around the corner and that Friday cannot eat virtual planets. Friday also sees no imminent risk of a state stealing his possessions.

So in this case, both Robinson and Friday know that the planets as a medium of exchange are not deliverable to the other as a tangible good to satisfy the other’s real preferences because neither Friday nor Robinson has a spaceship or other means of obtaining possession of real tangible planets for physical delivery to satisfy the other’s wants. The virtual planets are merely a mutually understood method of describing a finite amount of money in a non-good form that has the advantage that it cannot be stolen by the state. The planet names used by Robinson and Friday only serve to specify an intellectually-defined scarcity of something imaginary. So, in this example we can see that the whole virtual solar system cannot be exchanged for a handful of real macadamia nuts. Even though the agreed-upon number of planets that are possessed in a virtual sense represents a finite supply, those virtual planets can never meet any physical needs or tangible preferences in the free market context where Robinson and Friday reside.

In this situation, real bananas and real macadamia nuts trump a completely virtual currency, even one that has a limited supply.

Moral Hazard of Bitcoin

Competing currencies are wonderful, but we still can speculate about how each one would function in a free society or a non-free society and which ones would out-compete the others under different circumstances. Bitcoinesque currencies may or may not have a role in a surveilled, concentration camp society, where prisoners’ possessions and incoming care packages are continually plundered by the prison guards, but they may be lacking utility in a free economy. Non-good virtual currencies have the “shortfall” that they don’t have legal tender laws to force their wide acceptance with guns as do imaginary state monies. Modern man may have become used to these state plunder laws to the point that he may contemplate that non-good items can and do function as money, since he sees the state forcing this to happen around him. But economic reality is different when people are allowed to function without the state mandates and threats, improving their lives in the process.

If society as a whole gets freer, or when pockets of freedom develop, there may also be a moral hazard that will affect Bitcoin holders. They may begin to favor some level of statism that will preserve the value of Bitcoins by maintaining some of the perceived state plunder risk involved when dealing with real commodity exchanges in a free society. The pressure of freedom on Bitcoin may reduce its value and motivate some intelligent holders to value state seizure actions that made this non-good currency so enticing in the first place. There is a risk that Bitcoin holders may become tacit or vocal advocates of barriers to entry for commodity monies as those competing monies may reduce the value of their Bitcoin holdings in a freer or “opt-out” economy where people aren’t baring their souls to a plundering system. Bitcoin holders – seeing their “wealth” dissipate in that context – may militate against the idea of real goods dominating as a medium of exchange.

State caused phenomena often have warped aspects to them because they are the outgrowths of, or response to, an evolving coercive or bubble-causing process. But those things, which sometimes appear as a small previously unneeded detour around the state or as a larger widespread degradation in the human condition don’t always, or even usually, or possibly ever contribute to the long-term benefit of mankind when the specific state pressure ends or decreases.

And when the topic is money, it is one of utmost importance since money is one-half of most daily transactions and one of the primary means by which men express preferences and honor commitments during their lifetimes and across generations. A temporary non-good mechanism that does not pass any real tangible value is a doubtful way to plan one’s future or to convey wealth to one’s heirs.

The doubts on long-term viability of Bitcoin become more relevant when more and more people opt out of state structures – as is common in Latin America – and begin to deal directly with each other without allowing a predatory third party to monitor and intervene in every transaction.

224269,"“The greatest crime since World War II has been U.S. foreign policy.” (Former US Attorney General, Ramsey Clark, b 1927.)

As outlined by Felicity Arbuthnot in this incisive historical review, the US is now providing weapons to the Maliki government to fight Al Qaeda in Iraq and the Levant (AQIL). In a bitter irony, they are also supplying AQIL with weapons to fight the US puppet regime.

This article carefully documents the role of war crimes in feeding the military industrial complex. “War is Good for Business” and so are war crimes. Russia is tacitly complicit in selling weapons to the Iraqi “government” which constitutes a US proxy regime.

The not so hidden objective is twofold: to feed multibillion dollar contracts to the US weapons producers while also contributing to the ongoing destruction of Iraq as a nation state. (GR Editor. M.Ch.)

Iraq War Preparations Behind Closed Door

On February 10th 2003, German Green MP Joschka Fischer, then Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor, stunned an international security conference, in Munich’s opulent 19th century Bayerischer Hof hotel discussing the proposed invasion of Iraq, by banging on the table, switching to English to guarantee Donald Rumsfeld understood and shouted of the US arguments for war: ” … I am not convinced.” As he spoke, he gazed at the then US Defence Secretary over his silver, half framed spectacles, concluding: “That is my problem, I cannot go to the public and say, ‘these are the reasons’, because I don’t believe in them.”

The astute Herr Fischer recognized a pack of lies when he heard them and saved Germany from enjoining a war of aggression – Nuremberg’s “supreme international crime” – against a country which posed no threat and had no way of defending itself against the world’s most devastating and destructive weapons, whose poisonous residual pollution will continue to maim and kill generations to come for all time.

Tony and George W.

Both Tony “I’d do it again” Blair and George W. Bush face a citizen’s arrest whenever they appear in public, with Blair also reiterating with others responsible for bombing Iraq back to a pre-industrial age (again) that the country is a better place without Saddam, “a tyrant who killed his own people.”

In fact the Western trumpeted mass graves found in Iraq were from the 1991 war and subsequent US encouraged uprising and it’s predictably violent suppression.

In Kurdistan, where the people in the Iran border are were terribly caught in the crossfire from the weapons used by both devastated sides (and sold to both sides by the US) Saddam Hussein was firmly in the firing line for the terrible deaths at Halabja. However a meticulous 1990 US War College Report threw doubt on the facts of even that horror, stating: “Iraq was blamed for the Halabja attack, even though it was subsequently brought out that Iran too had used chemicals in this operation, and it seemed likely that it was the Iranian bombardment that had actually killed the Kurds.” (i)

Further, according to a 2008 study (ii) George W. Bush: “and seven top officials – including Vice President Dick Cheney, former Secretary of State Colin Powell and then National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, made 935 false statements about Iraq” during the two years following 11th September 2001.

However, the US and UK are seemingly remarkably selective when it comes to tyrants who “kill their own people”, and not only have failed to censure their tyrannical Iraqi puppet, Nuri al-Maliki, but are arming him to the teeth with the same weapons which are linked to the horrific birth defects, and cancers throughout Iraq, which he is now using on “his own people.” Moreover, if allegations from very well informed sources that he holds an Iranian passport are correct, to say that US-UK’s despot of choice appears in a whole new political light would be to massively understate.

“Counterterrorism” is “Good for Business”

To facilitate Al-Maliki’s assault on Iraq’s citizens, the US “rushed” seventy five Hellfire missiles to Baghdad in mid-December. On 23rd January Iraq requested a further five hundred Hellfires, costing $$82 million – small change compared to the $$14 Billion in weapons provided by America since 2005.

The AGM-114R Hellfire II (image below), nauseatingly named “Romeo”, clocked in at: $$94,000 each – in 2012. Such spending on weaponry in a country where electricity, clean water, education and health services have all but collapsed since the fall of Saddam Hussein.

Last week an “American cargo jet loaded with weapons” including 2,400 rockets to arm Iraqi attack helicopters also arrived in Baghdad.(iii)

This week a contract was agreed to sell a further twenty four AH-64E attack helicopters (image below) to Iraq “along with spare parts and maintenance, in a massive $$6.2 Billion deal.” With them comes the reinvasion of Iraq, with: “hundreds of Americans” to be shipped out “to oversee the training and fielding of equipment”, some are “US government employees”, read military, plus a plethora of “contractors”, read mercenaries. (iv)

According to Jane’s Defence Weekly, on November 15th 2013 Iraq also took delivery of: ” its first shipment of highly advanced Mi-35 attack helicopters as part of a $$4.3 Billion arms purchase from Russia”, of an order of: “about 40 Mi-35 and 40 Mi-28 Havoc attack helicopters.”

The all to “attack his own people” in the guise of defeating “Al Qaeda” in Anbar province and elsewhere where the people have been peacefully protesting a near one man regime of torture, sectarianism, kangaroo courts which sentence victims who have also had confessions extracted under torture.

The chilling death penalty regime, lead the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay to comment, with considerable understatement: “Weaknesses in the criminal justice system means that the death sentence is often handed down under questionable circumstances in Iraq.”

On 22nd January it was reported that thirty eight people had been executed in the previous four days.(v) In 2013 Iraq had the third highest executions in the world, according to Amnesty International.

So now Al-Maliki is to unleash weapons of mass destruction on any who oppose his reign of terror. Hellfire missiles, also used by the US forces in Fallujah are described as “Thermobaric Hellfire Missiles”(vi) “Their effective performance in Fallujah led to major production contracts in 2005.”

“Thermobaric weapons use high temperature/high pressure explosives as anti-personnel incendiary weapons. They char or vaporise victims in the immediate target location, or suffocate and collapse internal organs with their extended blast/vacuum effects.”

“These weapons use a new generation of reactive metal explosives, some of which are suspected of using Uranium for the high temperature and increased kinetic blast effects. If Uranium enhanced warheads were used in Fallujah these may have contained between ten and one hundred kgs of Uranium per warhead, depending on weapon type.” Ongoing.

They also contain a fuel air explosive (fae) of which:

“The (blast) kill mechanism against living targets is unique and unpleasant … What kills is the pressure wave, and more importantly, the subsequent rarefaction (vacuum) which ruptures the lungs ... If the fuel deflagrates but does not detonate,victims will be severely burned and will probably also inhale the burning fuel. Since the most common fae fuels, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide are highly toxic, undetonated fae should prove as lethal to personnel caught within the cloud as most chemical agents”, according to the US Defence Intelligence Agency. Syria watchers please note. (Emphasis mine.)

The temperature within the detonation can reach 4,500 to 5,400 °F (2,500 to 3,000 °C). Outside the cloud, the blast wave travels at over two miles per second (3.2 km/s) – 7200 mph.

There are also reports of white phosphorous or napalm having being used by Maliki’s forces in Falluja. Certainly if one two minute video is authentic, as it appears to be, a tell tale inflammatory weapon which cannot be extinquished is well apparent. (vii – in Arabic, but the visual speaks for itself.)

On 28th January World Bulletin recorded: “Some 650 people have been killed or injured and 140,000 displaced by indiscriminate army shelling in Iraq’s western city of Fallujah” according to Iraqi Parliament Speaker Osama Nujaifi.

The people of Samarra, whose eye wateringly beautiful, golden domed Al-Askari Mosque was blown up in 2006, offered their homes and hospitality to the people fleeing Fallujah and Anbar province, but Maliki’s security warned Samarra residents not to accept any displaced Fallujah and Anbar families. They were given twenty four hours to leave Samarra, writes a friend in Iraq, adding: “Can you believe such criminality? Forcing the kicking out the refugees who left their houses due to heavy bombing by Maliki’s criminal forces?”

On Thursday 30th January a source with contacts in Fallujah gave the names behind the statistics of just a few of the injured arriving at Fallujah General Hospital:

Iman Mohammed Abdul Razzaq 40 years old (female)

Isaac Saleh Mohammed 4 years (Male)

Abeer Mohammed Saleh 18 years old (female)

Shorooq Borhan Ali 7 years (female)

Ashoaq Mohammed Jassim, 25 years old (female)

Sarah Mohammed Odeh, 13 years old (female)

Fatima Mohammed Odeh, 15 years old (female)

Saleh Mohammed Abdul Razzaq 45 years old (male)

Nobel Peace Laureate Obama and Prime Minister David Cameron’s regimes are as culpable for their continuing support and facilitating of Al-Maliki’s crimes against humanity as were Bush and Blair in the lies that delivered Iraq’s ongoing death and destruction.

But they would do well to note that the escalation of the unrest in Fallujah began on the 30th of December, the anniversary of Saddam Hussein’s execution – by a man who was also called Al-Maliki.

The puppet Iraqi Prime Minister further enraged a justifiably angry population last week with a speech on TV talking of the interference of other countries and their support for terrorist groups. The response was to point out his apparent amnesia over the fact that he entered Iraq on the back of the American tanks in an illegal invasion – and there is still the question of that alleged Iranian passport.

Given the Iraqi’s record of running out of patience with imposed despots, he should watch out. The last imposed Prime Minister called Nuri (al-Said) who ignored, as Wiki puts it: “poverty and social injustice, became a symbol of a regime that failed to address these issues, choosing a course of repression, to protect the privileged”, met a very unpleasant end.

As mentioned before, Iraq’s history repeats in uncanny ways.

222750,"Recently by Peter Dale Scott: Afghanistan, Colombia, Vietnam: The Deep Politics of Drugs and Oil

I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this agency [the National Security Agency] and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision, so that we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return.”  Senator Frank Church (1975)

In recent years I have become more and more concerned with the interactions between three important and alarming trends in recent American history. The first is America's increasing militarization, and above all its inclination, even obsession, to involve itself in needless and pernicious wars. The second, closely related, is the progressive shrinking of public politics and the rule of law as they are subordinated, even domestically, to the requirements of covert U.S. operations abroad.

The third, also closely related, is the important and increasingly deleterious impact on American history and the global extension of American power, of what I have called deep events. These events, like the JFK assassination, the Watergate break-in, or 9/11, which repeatedly involve law-breaking or violence, are mysterious to begin with, are embedded in ongoing covert processes, have consequences that enlarge covert government, and are subsequently covered up by systematic falsifications in media and internal government records.

One factor linking Dallas, Watergate, and 9/11, has been the involvement in all three deep events of personnel involved in America's highest-level emergency planning, known since the 1980s as Continuity of Government (COG) planning, or more colloquially as u201Cthe Doomsday Project.u201D The implementation of COG plans on 9/11, or what I call Doomsday Power, was the culmination of three decades of such planning, and has resulted in the permanent militarization of the domestic United States, and the imposition at home of institutions and processes designed for domination abroad.

Writing about these deep events as they occurred over the decades, I have been interested in the interrelations among them. It is now possible to show how each was related both to those preceding it, and those which followed.

I would like in this essay to go further and propose a framework to analyze the on-going forces underlying all of the most important deep events, and how they have contributed to the political ascendance of what used to be called the military-industrial complex. I hope to describe certain impersonal governing laws that determine the socio-dynamics of all large-scale societies (often called empires) that deploy their surplus of power to expand beyond their own borders and force their will on other peoples. This process of expansion generates predictable trends of behavior in the institutions of all such societies, and also in the individuals competing for advancement in those institutions. In America it has converted the military-industrial complex from a threat at the margins of the established civil order, to a pervasive force dominating that order.

With this framework I hope to persuade readers that in some respects our recent history is simpler than it appears on the surface and in the media. Our society, by its very economic successes and consequent expansion, has been breeding impersonal forces both outside and within itself that are changing it from a bottom-up elective democracy into a top-down empire. And among these forces are those that produce deep events.

I am far from alone in seeing this degradation of America's policies and political processes. A similar pattern, reflecting the degradation of earlier empires, was described at length by the late Chalmers Johnson:

The evidence is building up that in the decade following the end of the Cold War, the United States largely abandoned a reliance on diplomacy, economic aid, international law, and multilateral institutions in carrying out its foreign policies and resorted much of the time to bluster, military force, and financial manipulation.

But my analysis goes beyond that of Johnson, Kevin Phillips, Andrew Bacevich, and other analysts, in proposing that three major deep events — Dallas, Watergate, and 9/11 — were not just part of this degradation of American democracy, but played a significant role in shaping it.

As author Michael Lind has observed, there have for a long time been two prevailing and different political cultures in America, underlying political differences in the American public, and even dividing different sectors of the American government. One culture is predominantly egalitarian and democratic, working for the legal consolidation of human rights both at home and abroad. The other, less recognized but with deep historical roots, prioritizes and teaches the use of repressive violence against both domestic and Third World populations to maintain “order.”

To some extent these two mindsets are found in all societies. They correspond to two opposing modes of power and governance that were defined by Hannah Arendt as u201Cpersuasion through argumentsu201D versus u201Ccoercion by force.u201D Arendt, following Thucydides, traced these to the common Greek way of handling domestic affairs, which was persuasion (πείθειν) as well as the common way of handling foreign affairs, which was force and violence (βία).”

Writing amid the protests and riots of the 1960s, Arendt feared that traditional authority was at risk, threatened (in her eyes) by the contemporary u201Closs of tradition and of religion.u201D A half century later, I would argue that a far greater danger to social equilibrium comes now from those on the right who invoke authority in the name of tradition and religion. With America's huge expansion into the enterprise of covertly dominating and exploiting the rest of the world, the open processes of persuasion, which have been America's traditional ideal for handling domestic affairs, have increasingly tilted towards top-down violence.

This tilt towards violent or repressive power is defended rhetorically as a means to preserve social stability, but in fact it threatens it. As Kevin Phillips and others have demonstrated, empires built on violent or repressive power tend to rise and then fall, often with surprising rapidity. Underlying the discussion in this essay is the thesis that repressive power is unstable, creating dialectical forces both within and outside its system. Externally, repressive power helps create its own enemies, as happened with Britain (in India), France (in Indochina) and the Netherlands (in Indonesia).

The Socio-dynamics of Repressive Power in Large-scale Societies

But more dangerous and destabilizing has been the conversion of those empires themselves, into hubristic mechanisms of war. The fall of Periclean Athens, which inspired Thucydides' reflections, is a case in point. Thucydides described how Athens was undone by the overreaching greed (pleonexia) of its unnecessary Sicilian expedition, a folly presaging America's follies in Vietnam and Iraq. Thucydides attributed the rise of this folly in the rapid change in Athens after the death of Pericles, and in particular to the rise of a rapacious oligarchy. Paul Kennedy, Kevin Phillips, and Chalmers Johnson have described the recreation of this process in the Roman, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and British empires. Its recurrence again in recent American history corroborates that there is a self-propelling dynamic of power that becomes repressive.

It is useful to be reminded of the historical division between two cultures in America, which both underlay and predated the Civil War. But these two cultures have evolved and been reinforced by many factors. For example urbanization in America's South and West worked for most of the 20th century to meld the two cultures, but after about 1980 the increasing disparity of wealth in America tended to separate them to an extent recalling the Gilded Age of the 19th century.

More importantly, postwar U.S. history has seen the institutions of domestic self-government steadily displaced by an array of new institutions, like the CIA and Pentagon, adapted first to the repressive dominance and control of foreign populations abroad, and now increasingly dominant domestically. The manipulative ethos of this repressive bureaucracy promotes and corrupts those who, in order to be promoted, internalize the culture of repressive dominance into a mindset.

The egalitarian mindset is widely shared among Americans. But Washington today is securely in the hands of the global repressive dominance mindset, and a deepening of the military-industrial complex into what in my most recent book I call the American war machine. This transformation of America represents a major change in our society. When Eisenhower warned against the military-industrial complex in 1961 it was still a minority element in our political economy. Today it finances and dominates both parties, and indeed is now also financing threats to both parties from the right, as well as dominating our international policy. As a result, liberal Republicans are as scarce in the Republican Party today as Goldwater Republicans were scarce in that party back in 1960.

That change has been achieved partly by money, but partly as a result of deep events like the JFK assassination, the Watergate break-in, and 9/11. As a rule, each of these deep events is attributed by our government and media to marginal outsiders, like Lee Harvey Oswald, or the nineteen alleged plane hijackers.

I have long been skeptical of these u201Clone nutu201D explanations, but recently my skepticism has advanced to another level. My research over four decades points to the conclusion that each of these deep events

1) was carried out, at least in part, by individuals in and out of government who shared and sought to promote this repressive mindset;

2) enhanced the power of the repressive mindset within the U.S. government;

3) formed another stage in a continuous narrative whose result has been a transformation of America, into a social system dominated from above, rather than governed from below.

Please note that I am talking about the result of this continuous narrative, not about its purpose. In saying that these deep events have contributed collectively to a major change in American society, I am not attributing them all to a single manipulative u201Csecret team.u201D Rather I see them as flowing from the workings of repressive power itself, which (as history has shown many times) transforms both societies with surplus power and also the individuals exercising that surplus power.

We are conditioned to think that the open institutions of American governance could not possibly provide a milieu for plots like 9/11 against public order. But since World War Two covert U.S. agencies like the CIA have helped create an alternative world where power is exercised with minimal oversight, often at odds with public agencies' proclaimed policy objectives of law and order, and often in conjunction with lawless and even criminal foreign and domestic elements.

The expansion of this covert world has occurred principally in Asia. There covert U.S. decisions were made to build up drug-financed armies in Burma, Thailand, and Laos, in a series of aggressive actions that by the 1960s involved America in a hot Indochina War. This war, like the related wars that ensued later in Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan, was initiated by America for a mix of geostrategic and economic reasons, above all the desire to establish a dominant U.S. presence in an important region of petroleum reserves.

The country most deeply affected by the succession of Asian Wars has been America itself. Its expansive forces, backed by powerful interest groups, are now out of control, as our managers, like other empire managers before them, have u201Ccome to believe that there is nowhere within their domain — in our case, nowhere on earth — in which their presence is not crucial.u201D7

To illustrate this, loss of control, let us look for a moment at a milieu which I believe to have been an important factor in all of America's major domestic deep events: the CIA's ongoing interactions with the global drug connection.

Unaccountable Power: The CIA and the Return of the Global Drug Connection

Since World War Two the CIA has made systematic use of drug-trafficking forces to increase its covert influence  first in Thailand and Burma, then in Laos and Vietnam, and most recently in Afghanistan.8 With America's expansion overseas, we have seen more and more covert programs and agencies, all using drug traffickers to different and opposing ends.

In 2004 Time and USA Today ran major stories about two of the chief Afghan drug traffickers, Haji Juma Khan and Haji Bashir Noorzai, alleging that each was supporting al-Qaeda, and that Khan in particular u201Chas helped al-Qaeda establish a smuggling network that is peddling Afghan heroin to buyers across the Middle East, Asia and Europe.u201D9 Later it was revealed that both traffickers were simultaneously CIA assets, and that Khan in particular was u201Cpaid a large amount of cash by the United States,u201D even while he was reportedly helping al-Qaeda to establish smuggling networks.10

There is no longer anything surprising in the news that large U.S. payments were made to a drug trafficker who was himself funding the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The arrangement is no more bizarre than the CIA's performance during the U.S. u201Cwar on drugsu201D in Venezuela in the 1990s, when the CIA first set up an anti-drug unit in Venezuela, and then helped its chief, Gen. Ramon Guilln Davila, smuggle at least one ton of pure cocaine into Miami International Airport.11

It would be easy to conclude from these reports that the CIA and Pentagon intentionally use drugs to help finance the enemy networks that justify their overseas operations. Yet I doubt that such a cynical Machiavellian objective is ever consciously voiced by those responsible in Washington.

More likely, it is an inevitable consequence of the U.S. repressive style of conducting covert operations. Great emphasis is put on recruiting covert assets; and in unstable areas with weak governance, drug traffickers with their own ample funds and repressive networks are the most obvious candidates for recruitment by the CIA. The traffickers in turn are happy to become U.S. assets, because this status affords them at least a temporary immunity from U.S. prosecution.12

In a nutshell: I am describing a development that is not so much intentional, as a consequence of repressive dynamics. A related example would be the CIA's recurring use of double agents, again for the reason just suggested. In the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya, the chief planner was a double agent, Ali Mohammed, who surveyed the Embassy and reported to Osama bin Laden in 1993, just months after the FBI had ordered the Canadian RCMP to release him from detention.13 In the Mumbai terrorist attack of 2008, the scene was initially surveyed for the attackers by a DEA double agent, David Headley (alias Daood Sayed Gilani) whom u201CU.S. authorities sent … to work for them in Pakistan…despite a warning that he sympathized with radical Islamic groups.u201D14

The central point is that expansion beyond a nation's borders engenders a pattern of repressive power with predictable results  results that transcend the conscious intentions of anyone within that repressive power system. Newly formed and ill-supervised agencies spawn contradictory policies abroad, the net effect of which is usually both expansive and deleterious — not just to the targeted nation but also to America.

This is especially true of covert agencies, whose practice of secrecy means that controversial policies proliferate without either coordination or review. Asia in particular has been since 1945 the chief area where the CIA has ignored or overridden the policy directives of the State Department. As I document in American War Machine, CIA interventions in Asia, especially those that escalated into the Laotian, Vietnam, and Afghan wars, fostered an ongoing global CIA drug connection, or what I have called elsewhere a dark quadrant of unaccountable power.

This drug connection, richly endowed with huge resources and its own resources of illegal violence, has a major stake in both American interventions and above all unwinnable wars to aggravate the conditions of regional lawlessness that are needed for drug trafficking. Thus it makes perfect sense that the global drug connection has, as I believe, been an ongoing factor in the creation of an overseas American empire that most U.S. citizens never asked for. More specifically, the dark quadrant has contributed to all the major deep events — including Dallas, Watergate, and 9/11, that have helped militarize America and overshadow its public institutions.

Doomsday Power and the Military Occupation of America

I have said that, underlying the surface of America's major deep events, there has been a pattern of conflict between two mindsets — that of openness and that of repressive dominance — dating back to the Civil War and the Indian wars of the mid-nineteenth century (and before that to the American Revolution).15 But it would be wrong to conclude from this on-going pattern of conflict that there is nothing new in our current situation. On the contrary, America is in the midst of a new crisis arising from this very old antagonism.

Since World War Two, secrecy has been used to accumulate new covert bureaucratic powers under the guise of emergency planning for disasters, planning known inside and outside the government as the u201CDoomsday Project.u201D Known more recently (and misleadingly) as u201CContinuity of Governmentu201D (COG) planning, the Doomsday Project, under the guiding hands in the 1980s of Oliver North, Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, and others, became the vehicle on 9/11 for a significant change of government. This package of extreme repressive power accumulated under the guise of the Doomsday Project can be referred to as Doomsday Power. In concrete terms, the repressive power developed to control the rest of the world is now, to an unprecedented extent, treating America itself as an occupied territory.

What I mean by u201Cdoomsday poweru201D is the package of repressive mechanisms (which I have discussed elsewhere under their official name of u201Ccontinuity of governmentu201D or COG plans), that was prepared over two decades by the elite COG planning group, and then implemented beginning on 9/11. The package includes 1) warrantless surveillance, 2) warrantless detention, (including unprecedented abridgments of the right to habeas corpus), and 3) unprecedented steps towards the militarization of domestic security enforcement and shrinking of the posse comitatus acts.

One recent development of Doomsday power, for example, has been the deployment since 2008 of a U.S. Army Brigade Combat Team to be stationed permanently in the United States. A major part of its dedicated assignment is to be “called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control.u201D16 Many people seem to be unaware that Americans, together with this Brigade, have lived since 2002 under a U.S. Army Command called NORTHCOM.17 Yet if nothing is done to change the present course of events, historians may come some day to compare the stationing of this brigade in 2008 CE to the date, in 49 BCE, when Caesar, along with his legion, crossed the Rubicon.

And I believe that the forces that have worked for decades to create Doomsday power have, like the global drug connection, been involved in every one of the deep events, from Dallas to 9/11, that have helped bring us here.

735702,"The US Department of Agriculture spent about 95 billion dollars in FY 2005. A plurality of this money went to the various direct and indirect price support programs that raise the cost of food. The second-largest pile of billion-dollar bills goes to programs that buy food for the poor, who naturally can't afford enough nutritious food because of the price-support programs. A few billion goes to various money-losing deforestation projects on public lands that damage the environment and raise the cost of plywood.

Now I'm sure that we can all agree that 95 billion dollars (up only $$23 billion since the previous year, due to the cost-cutting efforts of our Republican President and Congress) would be a small price to pay for all these benefits. Unfortunately, just like the multi-trillion-dollar Social Security and Medicare obligations, America's largest price-support program is ""off the books.""

History of the Cocaine Price Support Program

The Cocaine Price Support Program (which today includes thousands of other commodities as well, such as Rush's Oxycontin, diamorphine, THC, testosterone, etc.; the program is sometimes referred to as the ""Drug War"") dwarfs all other price support programs. The Drug War is not contained within a single government department. The Drug War is not even contained within one government or group of governments, but is an integral part of them all. There are many urban legends claiming that one government or another (e.g., Holland) does not participate in the Drug War. Academic research has shown these rumors to be false. The Drug War extends throughout the Solar System and beyond.

Drug price supports have a very short history, as government functions go. There were no US price supports for drugs of any kind until the Harrison Act (passed December 17 1914, took effect April 1915). The Harrison Act specifically reserved the rights of physicians to prescribe opiates. Within months this had been ""interpreted"" to mean the right to imprison physicians for prescribing opiates. The courts allowed this bizarre progression down into legal Wonderland, and the Federal government had its precedent. The bloodstream of all US citizens was now owned by a government agency.

More widely felt at first than the Harrison Act was the Ethanol Price Support Program (""Prohibition""), Amendment XVIII, passed in 1919. While the EPSP had some of the same effects as the Drug War (more murders, more deaths from adulterated products, etc.), it fell short of its potential for several reasons. The most prominent of these reasons was that Alcohol Prohibition operated within the US legal system, and thus died ignominiously in 1933 when it was repealed.

The Drug War did not repeat this mistake. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and the other informal traditions of the Drug War simply asserted their own legitimacy, with no appeal to Constitutional authority. In fact, many government agencies draw the authority for their actions from their alleged usefulness to the Drug War, rather than from any obsolete Constitutional precedents. The invasion of Panama, foreign aid to the Taliban regime and other dictatorships, etc., derived their moral authority from the Drug War itself.

The Inversion of Authority

This new inverted authority supersedes all other civil authority, in the same way that the witch manias of medieval Europe did. At this point in history the entire US population, drug-using or not, lives in a state of perpetual Double Secret Probation. At any time of day or night, black-masked hoodlums waving German submachine guns and cursing wildly may kick in your doors, shoot you and/or your Labrador retriever and throw your family on the floor. Your property may be forfeited without trial. And just as in the witch manias, all sorts of false testimony can be used against you without recourse. If the ritually masked hoodlums bring their own drugs with them, and ""find"" them on your property, you are guilty. (In Dallas, they only have to ""find"" some billiard chalk… but that is another long story).

The Conspiracy Theory of Drug Price Supports

There are many in the mainstream media who promote a conspiratorial origin of the Drug War. Their claim is that the Congress, CIA, DEA, etc. (all groups noted for their altruism and concern for the common man) are engaged in a massive conspiracy to promote public health by raising the cost of certain drugs. Like most conspiracy theories, it is somewhat nondisprovable as to its claims for the motivations of the political classes. However, we can disprove the notion that raising the cost of drugs to users is good for them.

There have been many controlled experiments in this field. Take the previously mentioned case of US alcohol Prohibition. Deaths from adulterated alcohol soared during Prohibition, then went back down after repeal. Murder rates also went up, as did the economic cost of providing alcohol. Alcoholism rates were not affected. Then to add insult to injury, large well-controlled medical studies proved that moderate alcohol consumption, especially of red wine, is an important component of cardiac health. So it's a good thing that Prohibition failed so completely, or millions would have suffered early heart attacks.

Another controlled experiment was Canada's attempt to put a $$5 tax on cigarettes. Mass smuggling began immediately through the Mohawk Nation, with the usual murders and mayhem. Did Canadians quit smoking because their nicotine cost more? Did anyone expect them to? Of course not. New York has tried the same thing many times, with similar consequences.

The same story is repeated with opiates and cocaine. Before the Harrison Act, Americans used cocaine and opiates. Just like Rush Limbaugh, most of them used their drugs to overcome the various pains of life, while continuing to hold down their jobs and live their lives. Cheap heroin and cocaine didn't cause financial havoc for the users. And of course, most people weren't affected… because they didn't touch the stuff. Abstinence was somewhat promoted by the fact that drugstore sellers of legal drugs didn't come into the junior high schools and push their wares.

Death rates from illegal drugs are less than precise. Still, it is clear that hundreds of thousands of people die from tobacco use yearly, while deaths from all illegal drugs are estimated to be in the neighborhood of 5,000. Deaths from alcoholism and alcohol/drug interactions are in the tens of thousands; overdose deaths from marijuana (a drug with some substitution potential for alcohol) are zero.

The final nail in the benevolent-conspiracy theory is this: it is forbidden to sell safer alternative recreational drugs. The pharmaceutical companies are quite capable of providing drugs that mimic alcohol, nicotine, or whatever you want with fewer side effects. In fact, there is an alcohol mimic that has a ""sober-up pill"" to go with it; anyone concerned about the safety of children on the highways would have to see this as a positive social good. But there is no FDA category for ""recreational drug."" Anyone who tries to save the cirrhotic liver of the alcoholic will be locked up. This shows that whatever the motivation of the Drug War, it isn't concern for health.

The Costs of Drug Price Supports

Cost #1: Taxes. The US Bureau of Justice Statistics has moved some of the drug war off the books since 2003; they now count ""only those expenditures aimed at reducing drug use, rather than those associated with the consequences of drug use."" This Enronically reduces official Federal drug war spending to only 13 billion dollars, from the 19 billion of 2003. The most recent figures the site provides on state spending are from 1998, given as 78 billion dollars. Given that the cost-cutting Republicans have been very busy since 1998, I think we can safely say that the actual direct tax costs of the drug war are over $$100 billion.

Cost #2: The high prices of illegal drugs. All estimates of this cost are suspect (they are provided by those with a vested interest in making the problem appear as big as possible). But while the actual number of drug users may be open to debate, there is no question that legal heroin and cocaine only cost about as much as aspirin; marijuana is literally a weed. Now that they are illegal, they cost the economy tens of billions.

Cost #3: Loss of labor. About 1.5 million people were arrested for drug possession and/or sale in 2003. The overall US prison and jail population is over 2 million. Let's say roughly half that number is related to the drug war. When each drug user is criminalized, they turn from a worker making an average of $$40,000 to an inmate costing around $$30,000; that would be another $$70 billion or so annually.

Cost #4: Real (not victimless) crime. Murder has soared since the Drug War expanded in the 1970s.

Other crime rates attained heights in recent decades that make the Wild West look like Amish country. Inner-city youth can find easy ""careers"" as drug distributors. If drugs were legalized, these careers would disappear, along with drive-by shootings and ""gangsta culture.""

Cost #5: Terrorism. Every half-baked wannabe dictator with a few AK-47s can fund his nonproductive lifestyle with illegal drug sales. From the Taliban to the FARC in Colombia, US-designated ""terrorist"" groups make money from the US drug trade. If cocaine and heroin cost no more than aspirin, all these moochers would have to get real jobs.

And of course, all the law enforcement effort and prison space that goes into catching and jailing marijuana users is not available to look for murderers and terrorists. After 9-11, supposedly our politician's security priorities changed… but they didn't. Any serious attempt to catch terrorists smuggling weapons (or low-flying drones carrying biological weapons) doesn't have a chance of finding them among the thundering herds of drug smugglers.

So…. Why Drug Price Supports?

Drug Prohibition's costs are obviously much greater than any possible benefit to the general public. So why does every drug-using political hack from Rush Limbaugh to the most leftist pot-smoking Democrat advocate Drug Prohibition? For the same reason that politicians support price supports for milk or sugar: they increase the power of politicians. All price supports confer arbitrary power on those who administer them. Every ""cost"" I've listed above is a ""profit"" for the parasitic class. Let's run through them again:

Cost #1: Taxes, ~$$100 billion.

To the politician, a bureaucracy isn't a cost. It's a source of patronage and lucrative contracts.

Cost #2: The high cost of illegal drugs.

To the politician, an artificially high price isn't a cost. It's a source of funds; study the career of Chiang Kai-Shek or any number of US politicians.

Cost #3: Loss of labor.

The ability to lock political opponents up at will is worth billions to any politician. Not to mention, felons can't vote or own firearms, so the more convicts, the fewer effective political opponents. Of course politicians' children may get arrested occasionally for Prohibition violations, but that just makes them more dependent on Dear Old Dad.

And like any other bureaucracy, the prison industry is a source of patronage and contracts.

Cost #4: Real (not victimless) crime.

There was no Federal gun control in the US until after Prohibition; pre-1935 US citizens had machine guns, artillery pieces, tanks, whatever took their fancy. The first national gun control law was passed in the 1930s, supposedly as an anti-gangster measure; it put a $$200 tax on great-Grandpa's tommy gun. Today's gun control is justified as an anti- ""gangsta"" measure; supposedly if we confiscate Grandma's .38 revolver, this will prevent drive-by shootings from inner-city youth using illegal full-auto AKs. While not heavily dependent on logic, the contemporary support for gun control is driven largely by the violence caused by Prohibition.

Cost #5: terrorism.

Needless to say, terrorism is not a ""cost"" to those who want to expand government power. Drug Prohibition can be used by the US Imperator as a casus belli against any nation anywhere, for what nation does not ""harbor"" evil drug lords who sell their wares in the US? Even the sinister Canadians have numerous websites selling cut-rate pharmaceuticals to America's elderly poor. Drug Prohibition can be used as an excuse to give foreign aid to literally any regime; even the Taliban received ""anti-drug"" money.

The Obvious Solutions

The obvious solution for the productive classes is to abolish all price supports, whether for milk, cocaine, or sugar. Abolition of Drug Prohibition in the US would effectively end it worldwide. This would return trillions of dollars and millions of people to productive work, and divert their support from the parasitic classes around the world.

The obvious solution for the political class is the opposite; their solution is to try to make nicotine, caffeine, and phenylethylamine illegal too. If you like your green tea or dark chocolate, better oppose cocaine price supports on principle.

day brings fresh reports of killings in Iraq  US and other occupation

soldiers, yes, but even more Iraqis  Sunnis and Shiites alike.

Why this last?

Iraq

has been in an interregnum since Saddam was brought down. So long

as the occupation lasts, there is no long-term successor regime.

Therefore political jockeying for power must continue  pari

passu with the occupation. Therefore  so long as the occupation

continues  potential rivals for power (and their supporters)

will also continue to be killed  at all political levels:

municipal, provincial, national.

Thus

the longer the occupation lasts, the longer the interregnum, and

the longer the political killings go on And the longer ordinary

Iraqis have to live with daily, continuing fear, bombings, shootings,

lack of water and electricity

The

occupation can only end when the US politicians involved

feel they have squeezed the maximum political gain from it. At that

point, the political benefits come from withdrawal; staying on means

political losses. It is to be hoped that this point is reached

shortly after the 15 December elections.

At

that point, too, the covert war for power amongst the various groups

of Iraqi politicians  Sunni and Shiite, possibly Kurdish and

others  will no doubt come into the open. The length of this

power struggle cannot be predicted  but winners will eventually

emerge. Then and then only, will there be any possibility of peace

and security for ordinary Iraqis.

Meanwhile

the hapless Iraqis remain hostage to two sets of politicians

 their own and the American. All that the Iraqis 

and their friends  can do, is pray.

372222,"Recently by Mark Sisson: Is It Primal? — 10 Foods Scrutinized

Its Friday, everyone! And that means another Primal Blueprint Real Life Story from a Marks Daily Apple reader. If you have your own success story and would like to share it with me and the Marks Daily Apple community please contact me here. Ill continue to publish these each Friday as long as they keep coming in. Thank you for reading!

For most of my adult life Ive been called many things, but skinny has taken some getting use to.

For years I repeatedly followed the conventional ritual of low-fat, low-calorie dieting paired with exercise to lose weight. With each attempt I would lose weight, sometimes as much as a few dozen pounds at a time. However, constant hunger eventually won out over my best efforts to eat less while exercising more (as prescribed by the calories in, calories out mindset). I would regain the lost weight and then some. When New Years came along, I would resolve myself to try harder than the previous attempt. The sad part is that each time I expected different results doing roughly the same thing. Unfortunately, after losing and regaining the weight three times, I quit caring about my own health, even despite my wifes concerns.

I had lost hope that I had any real power to change or control my fate from being anything other than desperate, obese, and fatigued. I was becoming a model customer for the highly profitable drug, dieting, and medical industries. Inwardly, I blamed myself for lacking the self-discipline needed to lose and keep weight off. As I grew more obese, I eventually had to shop for larger clothes in big and tall mens clothing stores and catalogs. Being only 5 8 on a good day and tipping the scales north of 350 pounds at this point, I wasnt shopping for clothes in these venues because I was tall!

At the age of 26, in what is supposed to be the prime of my life, I was literally winded and sweating just walking into work each morning. I began to see myself the way society probably thought of me at first glance: a lazy glutton who either does not know how to count calories or ultimately chooses to remain obese. I eventually entered into a state of apathy about my health for the next year.

Fortunately, after watching my weight and health slowly deteriorate from the sidelines, a good friend of mine persuaded me to join a gym again. However, this time, instead of doing roughly the same weight loss ritual a fourth time, I wanted to try something not just mildly different with eating but completely different and unconventional.

While researching, I found what I was looking for when I stumbled onto this website and later The Primal Blueprint. Not wanting to wait for a hard copy, I downloaded The Primal Blueprint onto my e-reader and poured over it intently as I struggled to use the elliptical machine. With the exception of maybe vegetables and water being good for people, what I learned about Primal nutrition and lifestyle went against almost everything I had been taught as healthy since elementary school. Deep down, most of us want to think of ourselves as health conscious to some degree, but much of what it means to be health conscious is monopolized by todays conventional weight loss advice. In retrospect, holding onto such ideas of what health conscious people are supposed to believe and eat was dragging me into the depths of poor health.

Marks clear and engaging writing style forced me to contemplate the possibility that what was lacking in my previous weight loss attempts was not self-discipline or motivation but the conventional advice itself. Like pulling harder and harder against a door that says Push, perhaps what I had done in the past was working against my body rather than with it. Instead of blaming myself, I thought, maybe I didnt fail to follow conventional advice but conventional advice failed me. This possibility rekindled the hope and optimism that was all but extinguished as collateral damage during my previous weight loss attempts.

Up to this point, gastric bypass was becoming a looming option if I couldnt reverse course and keep weight off. Frightened by this prospect and a painful family history of Type 2 diabetes (my mom is in end stage renal failure), I urgently experimented with Primal low-carb eating right away, even before I had completely finished reading The Primal Blueprint. I wasnt going to wait for 40 years of conventional weight loss advice to improve its dismal track record. I needed to change now.

Lacking any culinary skills or imagination, I started simple. Eggs, bacon, butter, fish, sausage, steak, broccoli, lettuce, low-sugar yogurts, some cheeses, nuts, and the occasional whey protein shake all quickly became staples of mine for two weeks. I was a little hesitant to eat bacon, eggs, butter, and steak because I was raised to believe these were bad foods. But I took a primal hop of faith that such foods that have been part of human history for much of our existence wouldnt suddenly do harm to my health now. It also helped that they happen to taste great!

After my full two week low-carb Primal trial, limiting myself to just 25 net carbs per day (the amount where I discovered that would keep me in nutritional ketosis), I dropped 15 pounds. This wasnt the only positive change I experienced. Unlike previous attempts, the blood sugar roller coaster that I rode every day eating low-fat/high-carb, which I had come to accept as normal, completely stopped. I consistently had more energy, which made it easier to move more. I rarely craved sweets as my taste buds were beginning to rehabilitate themselves from years of abuse. I felt years younger, and portion sizing seemed to take care of itself as my appetite was sated.

The rekindled hope that I could control my health and fate soon transformed into an implacable appetite to learn more. As I continued to lose more weight and feel great, I devoured as much paleo and low-carb literature as I could find. I read blogs and books by Drs. Michael and Mary Dan Eades, Dr. Cate Shanahan, Gary Taubes, and many others; I listened to many podcasts from Jimmy Moore. Although not Primal or low-carb per se, I also read a lot of Michael Pollan who piqued my curiosity about how and where my food is made. For almost a year, I would actually look forward to using the elliptical machine just so I could unlearn and re-educate myself about food and nutrition science in peace. Learning to conquer my fears of so-called artery clogging saturated fats (talk about a loaded phrase!) and cholesterol in my foods were two of many epiphanies I experienced as I was embracing more of the low-carb Primal lifestyle.

90321,"Recently by Anthony Wile: Doug Casey on the ‘Worsening Storm,’ QE3 and the Hard Assets Alliance

Introduction: Judge Andrew P. Napolitano joined the FOX News Channel (FNC) in January 1998 and serves as its senior judicial analyst. Judge Napolitano is the youngest life-tenured Superior Court judge in the history of the state of New Jersey. While on the bench from 1987 to 1995, Judge Napolitano presided over more than 150 jury trials and sat in all parts of the Superior Court  criminal, civil, equity and family. He has handled thousands of sentencings, motions, hearings and divorces. For 11 years, he served as an adjunct professor of constitutional law at Seton Hall Law School, where he provided instruction in constitutional law and jurisprudence. Judge Napolitano returned to private law practice in 1995 and began television broadcasting in the same year. Judge Napolitano’s many books include: It is Dangerous to be Right When the Government is Wrong: The Case for Personal Freedom (2011), Constitutional Chaos: What Happens When the Government Breaks Its Own Laws (2006), A Nation of Sheep (2007) and NY Times bestsellers The Constitution in Exile: How the Federal Government Has Seized Power by Rewriting the Supreme Law of the Land (2007) and Lies the Government Told You: Myth, Power and Deception in American History (2010).

Daily Bell: Let’s get started. What about the Rand Paul controversy? Where do you stand on his endorsement of Romney?

Judge Napolitano: Rand Paul is a friend of mine but yes, that endorsement certainly got him slaughtered on his Facebook page; they were running 50:1 against him. My whole view  and I’ve said this on air  Mitt Romney’s views are closer to Barack Obama’s than they are to Thomas Jefferson’s and he presents just a slightly different version of big government. In fact, in the defense policy he might actually be worse than the President because he seems to be itching to start a war with Iran. In terms of domestic policy, he contemplates additional borrowing, maybe a little less than the President has borrowed. If the President is re-elected he might bring us to $20 trillion in debt by 2016; Romney might bring us to $18 trillion in debt by 2016. Either of those federal debts would be unsustainable.

Daily Bell: Give us a quick summation and your thoughts on the election this year.

Judge Napolitano: I have harshly criticized Paul Ryan for having voted to offer the president to raise the debt ceiling; I have also criticized him for his support of the Patriot Act and its extensions and the National Defense Authorization Act. He is a classic George Bush Republican who does not believe that the Constitution means what it says. I was heartened to hear him quote me the other day when he said ‘our rights come from our humanity,’ which is a gift from God, and they don’t come from the government. But unfortunately, he lied by his vote to take our rights in the legislation that I have just articulated.

On the other hand, I don’t think his designation by Governor Romney has succeeded in getting capital and getting the Governor’s taxes off the front page, and has zeroed the media focus on what should be an essential aspect of this election. That is who would be a better steward of the economy. I say steward because they both want to be steward of the economy. To me, the steward of the economy should be the people who participate in it and not the government. It should be the free choices of entrepreneurs and consumers; they shouldn’t need the hand of the government.

Having said that, I disagree with the fundamental premise of both of their campaigns. Now, the President believes that government is there for people who can’t do what they should do for themselves. Governor Romney wants to make government more efficient. I don’t want to make it more efficient; I want most of it to go away. I’m sure I would be a challenger of much of what a President Romney would do  and I know that I sometimes get in trouble when I use the Romney/Jefferson comparison but I don’t think that’s an opinion; I think it’s a truism. His views are much closer to Obama than they are to Jefferson.

Daily Bell: Not much difference between the two of them would you say?

Judge Napolitano: Well, no, but that’s the society we’ve created. We really don’t have two political parties anymore. We have one big government party, with a democratic wing that likes war and taxes and individual welfare and staying in power, and a republican wing that likes war and deficits and corporate welfare and staying in power. There is very little difference between them. I mean, Ron Paul and Gary Johnson are so different from the mainstream Republicans and the mainstream Democrats; they really present the only alternative. It’s basically a choice between Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum.

I understand the animosity towards the president, I understand the fear he instills in those who embrace traditional values, I understand the anybody-but-Obama. I understand the argument of those who say at least Mitt Romney is a step in the right direction. My own view is that those who are afraid of big government under President Obama will be equally as afraid of it under a President Romney.

Daily Bell: We saw he ran a rare press conference disputing the accusations that he is running an unfair and negative election campaign.

Judge Napolitano: Well, this is a very negative campaign. The President cannot run on his record. His record on the economy is reprehensible and he is, of all occupants of the White House, the most dangerous to human freedom since Abraham Lincoln. He doesn’t want to touch either of those subjects so his only approach is to attempt to destroy Governor Romney.

Daily Bell: What’s your take on Ron Paul? Give us a summation of his career.

Judge Napolitano: I think he probably continues to go around the country, keeping the dialogue going of small government and maximum individual liberty. I think he probably passes the mantel to his son, Senator Paul. Senator Paul and Governor Johnson probably battle it out and if they can’t come to some kind of agreement as to who will personify human freedom and who, in public life, will be the champion of it. I think that’s probably a good thing because I think the movement will continue to grow.

With Congressman Paul free from congressional duties he might actually stir up the pot even more then he’s done already. My next book, which comes out after election day, is an assault on the progressive era, dedicated to Ron Paul in large measure because no person in these times has done more to remind people about the loss of liberty than he. He has been an inspiration to millions and among those millions is me.

Daily Bell: Are you a backer of Rand’s generally?

Judge Napolitano: Look, I understand why he endorsed Governor Romney. Of course, I would never do it but I understand why he did it because he has to live in the Republican Party and has to have peace with the Republican establishment in the United States Senate. I am sure it was done with the consent of his father. I understand it did not go over well with rank and file and I know that because it didn’t go over well with me. Once this election is over, whether Governor Romney wins or the President is re-elected, I think Rand Paul will be his usual self and that usual self is one of the very few members of the Congress who believes that the Constitution means what is says.

Daily Bell: You were negative about the freedom trend in the US last time we spoke. Are you more hopeful now?

Judge Napolitano: No, not at all. No. The government keeps getting larger and more in our faces. There is less outrage than there used to be. The Air Force predicts that in ten years there’ll be 30,000 drones in the sky at any given moment and that some of them will be the size of golf balls and some will be the size of mosquitoes, and nobody is complaining about that. People seem willing to give up their privacy in exchange for safety. People forget they need protection from the government.

People are confusing freedom and safety. Freedom does not promote safety; freedom promotes unfettered choices, free from government interference. It accepts the fact that there will be some dangerous things in society but it assumes that risk from danger without is a more desirable state of affairs than an authoritarian government than within. I think these are bad days for freedom and unless a Ron Paul, Rand Paul or Gary Johnson is in the White House they will continue to get bad. I just couldn’t imagine a President Romney dismantling the security state, not enforcing the Patriot Act, disregarding the National Defense Authorization Act, stopping all the drones. I just couldn’t imagine that happening. Until that happens, we’re at the tender mercies of whatever faceless bureaucrats are running the government.

Daily Bell: How did the US Constitution get perverted?

Judge Napolitano: Well, I think that the problems with the Constitution began in the Lincoln administration, when he drilled people for doing what the founding fathers did, which was seceding from an overbearing central government. In the so-called Reconstruction years, which really were the years of military occupation in the South  Reconstruction is just a euphemism for that  the military directed daily life in the South for 10 years. That really whetted the federal government’s appetite for more power. Now we see a recession in that power for the next 30 years and then it comes back in the Progressive Era, and the progressives are so all-encompassing that they sit even on the courts. And the courts let Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson get away with things like, ‘we are not going to let the Constitution stand in our way’ for what the people need. That’s utterly inconsistent with their oath to office.

Of course, the real serious troubles with the Constitution are with the FDR years. FDR has eight members on the Supreme Court and they are doing bizarre things like saying that wheat to the farmer, which grows in his backyard, which is ground into flour and made into baked goods all of which are consumed by his family, somehow constitutes interstate commerce, and people accept that with a straight face. That’s, of course, the infamous, Wickard v. Filburn case in 1942. From and after that case, all bets are off and the Congress now knows that its authority to regulate even minute behavior will be held up by the court, even behavior so infinitesimal that it’s not measureable by standard economic mechanisms. Because Wickard v. Filburn basically says if small infinitesimal activity ended up with other small infinitesimal activity, that’s how the entire country could affect interstate commerce and the government could regulate even the small, infinitesimal parts of it. This would send Jefferson and Madison to the madhouse if they learned that the Supreme Court did this and the Congress acted upon it but as we know, that’s what happened.

Daily Bell: Comment on the Supreme Court’s decision regarding Obamacare, please.

Judge Napolitano: Well, I think it’s one of the most tortured, twisted, unexpected, unaccepted, created opinions in modern times. Think of it this way: The court is an arbiter between the sides that are arguing before it. Either one side is right and the other side is wrong or one is partially right and the other side is partially right but the court really is without authority to come up with its own theory of a piece of litigation. So if both sides say this is not a tax, it is inconceivable that the courts on its own could say it’s a tax. Rulings must come from the arguments made before it; otherwise there is no ability to rely on what the court will do if you are really just rolling the dice when you go in there.

Now, I know that sometimes bizarre compromises are necessary, to keep the five-person majority from becoming a four-person minority but this compromise  let’s call this thing a tax even when its proponent denied that it was a tax  is unprecedented in our history. The Supreme Court has never declared something to be a tax that the congress did not say was a tax. Think about it, the opinions to use for the following proposition: The government can do whatever it wants, as long as the penalty for your not complying with the government’s wishes is the imposition of tax, even if the behavior regulated by the government doesn’t come from the Constitution. That is simply unacceptable. It is simply blatantly unconstitutional. That is simply offering the Congress on a dish unlimited federal power that even the Congress and the president didn’t ask for.

Daily Bell: You are a libertarian. Are you an anarcho-capitalist?

Judge Napolitano: Well, it depends how you define those terms. I am a Randian, as in Ayn Rand, on economics. I am a Rothbardian, as in Murray Rothbard, on most philosophical principals, specifically the morality of government in our lives. Some of the younger producers who worked with me on the late, lamented, now-missed ""Freedom Watch"" used to say that I was an anarcho-capitalist. I don’t know what the term means, but I am always the most libertarian person in the room. (Laughing)

Daily Bell: Rothbard was. How can one believe in representative democracy as an anarchist?

Judge Napolitano: Representative democracy presumes that those who receive power from the voters will respect the natural law and will respect the Constitution. We rarely have seen in our era that both the natural law and the Constitution are respected. Majority rules obviously means the rights of the minority so only a government tempered by the natural law, and in America tempered by the Constitution, has a moral one. That’s why I said earlier almost all federal law is unconstitutional because it’s either not grounded in a power granted to the Congress in the Constitution, or even if grounded there, violates the natural law. Beyond that we’d have to get into specifics. Under the natural law, the government only has two purposes, and those are to preserve, protect and defend our rights from fraud and force and nothing else.

Daily Bell: Is representative democracy a positive choice? Or does it always lead to despotism eventually?

Judge Napolitano: It usually leads to despotism because it usually draws to it people who suffer from labido dominandi, a Latin phrase that St. Augustine used, which is the ‘lust to dominate’ and the government doesn’t usually draw people who think the way Ron Paul or Gary Johnson or I do. When I was in the government, in the judicial branch  we are really exceptions. The vast majority of people who are drawn there are busybodies, nanny-staters, bed-wetters and do-gooders who think that somehow they have the power to tell us how to live our lives differently than how we choose to live them.

So yes, representative democracy will lead to despotism without a judiciary seriously committed to constitutional principals and natural law principals. We do not have a judiciary today. Occasionally we hear it from Justice Thomas; sometimes we hear it from Justice Scalia; occasionally we hear it from Justice Kennedy. There are a smattering of lower court federal judges, but only these arguments are appointed by Democratic presidents. But for the most part, the Judiciary presumes to be constitutional whatever the legislative branch has done, and thus finds ways to uphold legislation.

Von Mises said that government is essentially the negation of liberty. I believe he is correct. From that it follows that whatever the government does should be presumed unconstitutional and violative of the natural law. Rather than the challenger having the burden of saying why the legislation or the government behavior is wrong, the government should have the burden of saying why the legislation or the government behavior is consistent with the Constitution and consistent with the natural law. Simply switching that presumption would radically change the ability and the inclination of the courts to invalidate much of what government does in deference to our individual choices.

Daily Bell: Is modern law made to include natural law and economics? If not, why not?

Judge Napolitano: It doesn’t matter. Natural law is part of our humanity and modern law is subject to that. The creature is subject to the creator. The creators of law are human beings and we all are subject to the laws of physics, the laws of economics, the laws of nature. ‘Some men say the Earth is round and some men say the Earth is flat but if it is round, let the kings command flatten it, and if it is flat by an act of parliament, make it round.’ Of course, the answer to both questions is no because all governments are subject to the laws of nature as are human beings. So the government ignores the natural law but it is ultimately subject to the natural law just like we are all subject to the movement of the Earth around the Sun and to a flat Earth or a round Earth, whatever the case may be.

Daily Bell: We’ve argued for common law here  not British common law but real common law, pre-Babylon, common law as it existed within tribal contexts for tens of thousands of years. Can you comment on that?

Judge Napolitano: That’s a very complicated observation on your part. The common law that we inherited was the common law in Great Britain in the 17th and 18th centuries, which is essentially judge-written law based upon notions of fairness and tradition in history. For the most part it embodied the natural law and for the most part it has been irradiated by positive law, by the statutes that have been enacted by Congress, for instance, and by state legislatures. You remember that TV commercial, ""It’s not nice to fool Mother Nature?"" Whenever the government violates the natural law, there are unintended consequences to it. I believe that we were created by an omnipotent, Supreme Being. Some people call him Allah; some people call him as do I, the Father. Now, I believe he made us in his image and likeness and he doesn’t have a body but we do; he’s not going to die and we are. But the one thing absolutely in common between the creator and the creature is freedom. When the government takes away human freedom, it takes away that one aspect of our humanity that is closest to the creator. There are inimitably adverse consequences to such interference.

Daily Bell: Follow-up: Why does the state need to be in charge of law? Why can’t people pursue justice privately?

Judge Napolitano: Because as a token of all this, government doesn’t share power. It would take a government of Ron Paul’s, Rand Paul’s and your humble correspondent here to shrink the government radically and to repose into the hands of individuals the ability to address injustice on their own. It truly goes back to the Middle Ages when people transferred to the government the right to punish.

Think about it. If my house is broken into and they steal my favorite book, what business is that of the government? Well, the government has decided that they have the right to prosecute and punish but in a different world, I would have insured and have insurers’ authority to pursue the thief, and it wouldn’t cost my neighbors any money to bring about justice. But we live in a world where the right to punish exists only in the hands of the government because it was perceived as fairer and more convenient at the time it was transferred. It’s not fairer or more convenient today; it’s politically subjective today. The greatest lawbreaker is the government itself so how could we possibly rely on the government to give us justice?

Daily Bell: What is justice?

Judge Napolitano: Depending on each individual, justice is different in different cases. Justice is certainly not the government taking property from us against our will. I mean justice is a series of voluntary transactions which, when interfered with, are made whole again on the basis of fairness and principals of morality. I can give you thousands of examples of injustice; most prosecutions are unjust because they tax the general populace for what is essentially a private dispute.

Daily Bell: Wouldn’t private justice with its duels and vendettas be far preferable to public justice that in the US has incarcerated up to six million or more people, many of them unfairly, for long prisons sentences that doom families to separation and poverty?

Judge Napolitano: I don’t want to get into duels and vendettas but if you are at home one night and you hear a knock on the door, and you answer the door and a guy standing there points a gun at you, and says give me your money, I want to give it away in your name, and you think the guy’s crazy and you call the police, and you find out he is the police, come to collect your taxes … if you don’t pay them they come with a gun. What do they do with the money? They give it away.

This is basically the system we have today and it is the system that we accept because we have come to the perverse belief in government, which can’t deliver the mail, which can’t run the school system, can’t manage roads without potholes in them but somehow it can keep us safe and keep us prosperous. It can’t. It is the perverse reliance upon government’s delivered goods and services that has proven for hundreds of years, or at least 120 years, that it cannot deliver. The continued refusal to examine the proper role of government in our society that has brought us to where we are today and to the point where we can see change in people’s thinking, for the government to be shrunk.

Daily Bell: What is the rationale for modern jurisprudence as applied by the modern state?

Judge Napolitano: The rationale is the assumption by a majority of persons that the state can more efficiently, and more justly, administer justice than individuals can. This, of course, has resulted in vast discretion being reposed into the hands of the state agents, police and prosecutors, whose charge is to prosecute. It has actually been argued that the decision to prosecute is among the most powerful in the government because it is essentially unreviewable. Of course, the decision to prosecute also denotes the decision not to prosecute; this, of course, enables prosecutors to violate the rule of law; that is to let some people off the hook while choosing to prosecute others for the same crime, thus making decisions on a political basis rather than on the basis of justice. The prosecutor essentially becomes the avenging angel for the victim and all the weight, all of the might and all of the state then comes down on the prosecutor’s target for the charge for which the prosecutor has indicted the target. Almost always they charge greater than what the evidence will have seen so that when the negotiation process begins to settle the issue amicably, by what is commonly called a plea bargain, the prosecutors starts from a position of strength and the defendant starts from a position of weakness.

Daily Bell: Our idea of common law is the patchwork of law and courts that sprang up in Europe and especially in Britain and Ireland. These courts had different standards for justice and different ways of arriving at a verdict. We see nothing inconsistent about this, as we believe that most justice is ""rough"" (one way or another) and that cases are unique. In fact, the idea of competitive, marketplace justice is, of course, most controversial. (Any kind of marketplace competition is a bit controversial these days.) What about the positives of rough justice? Must justice always be fair and homogenous? Is it in practice?

Judge Napolitano: It is not always fair but it strives to be fair. The government almost always wins because it can carefully pick its targets. I mean, there are federal prosecutors in the country that have conviction rates in the upper 90 percent area simply because they know what targets to pick and what charges to file. But the roughness about the justice, about what you ask, has had an interesting transition. In the earliest days of common law, now 500 or 600 hundred years ago in England and Ireland, a jury was chosen because the jury knew the defendant and the victim. This was basically your friends and neighbors judging you. The theory of the common law was that the collective wisdom of 12 people who know the defendant and know or knew the victim are likely to result is rough, proximate but genuine justice.

Today, of course, we want the opposite. We want a jury of strangers that does not know the defendant and does not know or did not know the victim, and has no interest in the outcome and has no preconceived notion. So we really have switched 180 degrees on where the jurors come from and what type of preconceived notions we expect them to have. Now, do these cases usually result in justice? In my experience as a trial judge, and I tried about 150 jury trials in the eight years that I was on the bench, I think the result was almost always just or close to just. Sometimes the defendant could or should have been convicted of a crime one degree lower or sometimes one degree higher and in civil cases, sometimes the plaintiff got a little bit more than he or she deserved or not quite what he or she deserved but for the most part the collective wisdom, is usually correct.

That’s why the decision to prosecute is so important and presumptions in the law are so important. The law presumes that what the government does is correct and even though the government has to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty, it has all these presumptions going in its favor. They are sort of ""hidden"" in the law and they affect the language used by the judge in the courtroom, the procedures engaged in by the government, the advantages that the government has that it goes first and goes last, and it has virtually an unlimited budget in criminal cases. These are all things that a libertarian should know about and should want to examine, lest he or she come in the government’s crosshairs for a reason other than his or her criminal activity.

Daily Bell: The old common law courts were subject to private compensation, sometimes the compensation of a third party, as in Ireland. We believe that private payments might guarantee a better outcome than the current statist paradigm. What the West subscribes to today is a system in which the same entity (the state and its appurtenances) makes the law, enforces the law, renders the verdict and prescribes the sentence. To us this process is fraught with conflicts of interest. The person (the judge) who is rendering the verdict is on the same payroll as the prosecutor. What’s your take?

Judge Napolitano: Well, it requires a tremendous amount of courage and restraint and even fearlessness to resist the state when you are on the same payroll. One of the duties of the Constitution is the maintenance of duel systems of justice, state and federal. This frequently is a reason for challenging a state law in a federal court, rather than in a state court where the judge is popularly elected or subject to reconfirmation by the same officials whose law he or she is now being asked to invalidate.

In some states, like my own, New Jersey, after a period of time your tenure on the bench becomes life tenure and then, of course, you are utterly liberated to do the right thing. But in the probationary period, before you receive life tenure, there is in the back of your mind the awareness that you need to have your next appointment approved by the same people  or by the same mentality, let me say  who are enhancing the constitutional side of the law that you believe is unjust. Or you need to go before voters, who would never understand the niceties of constitutional jurisprudence and the fact that the rule of law protects the individual against the state  even if everybody else in society wants the individual to go, the individual still has certain rights.

So to tie a bow on your question, there is obviously an inclination on the part of state judges whose peril and tenure on the bench depends upon approval by the apparatus of the state to want to please the state. It is a rare state judge who has the courage to say to the state, ""No. You are wrong because the constitution doesn’t permit it."" It is far easier to do in the federal system, and it’s easier to do in the states that grant life tenure but only three states, New Jersey among them, do that.

Daily Bell: In free-market common law, the aggrieved party and putative offender might both pay a judge to render a verdict. The judge, who does this for a living, would have every incentive to present a fair verdict because such verdicts would add luster to his or her reputation and generate additional business. Additionally, common law has the added advantage that not everyone would make use of the system because some would seek to settle grievances on their own. This would result in a very polite society (and has in the past) as no one would want to offend anyone else. Once upon a time, ""manners"" were far more elaborate and prevalent for a reason. Can you comment, please?

Judge Napolitano: I would strongly prefer a system like that because it removes the heavy hand of the state from the resolution of disputes in which the state really has no legitimate interest. The state has no interest in providing a forum. This, of course, would require that laws be changed so as to provide insurance coverage for various events or calamities for which the state does have insurance companies to offer coverage or policies today.

Think about it. If you steal my chicken or I steal your cow, this is a dispute between us; what does the government care about it? The answer should be it doesn’t care at all but because the state loves power and the state does not like to share power, it likes to resolve all disputes the way it wants to resolve them. This drives up the cost and diminishes justice because it forces the disputants to follow the state’s rule and the state’s command and the state’s way, and this does not inure to politeness, civility or even the idea that a dispute could possibly be resolved amicably and justly, without the state being involved.

The state is not an instrument of justice; it’s an instrument of power. It holds itself out as an instrument of justice, and many of my former colleagues on the bench still believe it is an instrument of justice and jurors believe it’s an instrument of justice and trial courts believe they are instruments of justice, but basically they are wrong; they are instruments of power  the state’s power, the way the state wants it exercised.

Daily Bell: There is also an issue of honor and morality. In communal societies, where power has devolved to local levels, religion can often play an important role in how society is organized and how law is administered. Such societies are often shame-based, or have been in the past, and the prospect of shaming may act as a behavior modifier (as it does today but only vestigially). The combination of religiously oriented communal societies with local laws and customs, a common law heritage and the practice of dueling and so-called ""vigilante justice"" certainly poses an alternative to the current system of Western justice. Is this a realistic appraisal of past justice regimes or merely pie-in-the-sky?

Judge Napolitano: I think it’s a realistic appraisal of past regimes. I don’t know that it could happen here in the US tomorrow or in the lifetime of anybody reading this but it really was based on the first principals. One of the first principals of the common law and the natural law was the principal of subsidiarity. Why? Subsidiarity teaches that the least amount of government to resolve an issue is best so all governmental concerns should be resolved by the smallest amount of power, in the smallest unit of government, exercising the least power and the fewest resources possible. So it is far better for a dispute to be resolved by your neighbors than by Washington, DC.

Now, we don’t practice subsidiarity in the United States even though it is a first principal. Jefferson and Madison understood it. The Constitution was written subject to it and is a part of the natural law. The Catholic Church and most of Christianity teaches it and it is rarely practiced today. It is almost Jefferson’s ""That government is best that governs least,"" so that would be the American version of subsidiarity. But when it was practiced, the concepts and experiences articulated in your question were real and did happen and induced compliance with accepted standards behavior without the heavy hand of the state being involved.

Daily Bell: Some other potential criticisms of modern law… Is modern Western jurisprudence actually admiralty law?

Judge Napolitano: Admiralty law is a branch of common law that governed the behavior of sailors aboard ship so it was a separate version of the common law because in the year in which it became accepted in British courts, sailors had been aboard ships for many, many months. So events that occurred there, disputes between sailors and disputes between the command structure, needed to be resolved while they were on ship rather than waiting until they could return to port.

Or if it was a grievance matter then the law would permit the restraint of the person charged aboard ship until return to port. They were different. It was high seas and there was not country. In the early days there wasn’t even a statutory law so basically at trials judges did what they thought was fair and jurors did what they thought was fair, and from that grew a body of law called admiralty law. Today, admiralty law is essentially federal law written by the Congress governing the behavior of military and the civilians aboard ship outside the territorial areas outside the United States.

Daily Bell: Do US lawyers serve a British system or are they independent?

Judge Napolitano: The British system is loser pays. We do not have loser pays system in the United States. We have the beginnings of loser pays, by what is known as Rule 11 in the federal system. Rule 11 in the federal system permits the winner to have his or her legal fees paid by the loser when the loser argument is utterly frivolous. Now, that’s a long way from loser pays but it is also a giant step in that direction.

The amount of civil litigation in Great Britain per capita is far, far less than what we have here in the US because of loser pays. You sue, you win, you go home happily. You sue, you lose, you not only have your own legal bills but you also have the legal bills of the entity that you sued. We don’t have that here and there are certain exceptions to it, probably not appropriate to go through now, but we don’t have it here.

The argument against it is we would not have had the expansion of human liberty here if loser pays were the law because lawyers would be afraid to challenge the government. It’s like saying Brown v. Board of Education, which is essentially a challenge, a challenges that reached these decisions by pertinence. So the argument is if we had loser pays the lawyers would be afraid to bring that challenge for fear that they would have lost. The flip side of that is we live in a society that is terribly expensive in large measure because of explosion of litigation, which would not exist if we had losers pays. I do not think that loser pays is coming but I do see some small steps in the direction of it.

Daily Bell: Is the US a secret corporation?

Judge Napolitano: No. I try to understand that argument and I reject that argument. I don’t reject the people who make the argument because they are simply challenging the ability of the federal government to write any laws whatsoever other than those specifically articulated in the Constitution. That’s a view that I share, about the ability of the federal government and its limitations. But the argument that the United States is a secret corporation is one I’ve never understood and do not embrace.

Daily Bell: Did America ever go bankrupt? Is the country in legal receivership?

Judge Napolitano: Well, the country has defaulted many times  when it seized gold, when it seized silver, when it didn’t pay its debt  so yes, you could argue that the United States is bankrupt. Our governance is in debt by 16 trillion dollars and Obama has borrowed about 1 trillion a year in his four years in office. If he gets re-elected and does the same thing, in 2016 we’ll have a debt of 20 trillion dollars. That would generate about a trillion dollars a year in interest payments. That’s about 40 percent of the revenue collected by the federal government from its various sources and it cannot sustain itself when 40 cents on every dollar goes to debt service. It also cannot sustain itself if it printed cash in order to pay those debts because then inflation would be crazy. We are in serious danger of defaulting, and the only solution to this, in my view, is a return to the gold standard, competing dollars and this requires an enormous change in mindset of people in Washington.

Daily Bell: Is America currently under a state of emergency and legally led only by the president?

Judge Napolitano: I think we are a police state. I think we are a national security state. I think the government pays lip service to the Constitution and basically does whatever it wants to do. When the Congress let the President decide that he can kill people on his own and he can start wars on his own  he once threatened to borrow money on his own  when the Congress permits that to happen, this is close to being a dictator. For the most part, Congress is a potted plant while the president, whether it’s George W. Bush or Barack Obama, is allowed to do virtually whatever he can get away with. Frequently, the courts are reluctant to restrain him. It’s a deplorable state of affairs in which we are on the precipice of a cliff. The true TV commercial should not be granny going over the cliff; it’s all of us going over the cliff with the federal government pushing the wheel chair behind us.

Daily Bell: Why did we move from private law to ""public"" socialized law?

Judge Napolitano: Oh, my goodness, because people were bought off by the federal government. Why did FDR and LBJ create their massive establishments in order to create entitlements and in order to create dependence on the Democratic Party? People accepted the giveaways in return for the loss of freedom. Jefferson and Hamilton rarely agreed on anything but one thing they did agree on is when the public treasury becomes a public trough and the public learns this, it will send to the government people who will bring home the larger piece of the pie. That has happened, beginning in the Progressive Era and heightened in the FDR years, and heightened yet again when Republicans fell in line. They previously resisted the entitlement state; now they fall in line with it. That has produced a country in which half of the population receives a salary or material goods from the government, paid for by the other half. That also cannot survive in the context of freedom for very long.

Daily Bell: Why should the Supreme Court be the last word on justice? Why should people live under interpretations of the law made by strangers with their own agendas?

Judge Napolitano: Sometimes the Supreme Court justices do the right thing, and somebody has to have the final say. In my own view, the Constitution contemplates that states can reject oppressive federal laws and that state governments, either state legislature or the highest court in the state, has the power to invalidate a federal law in the state. We haven’t had that for 220 years but that was clearly contemplated by the founders. That would remove the monopoly on the final word from the Supreme Court. There’s an old phrase that the Supreme Court is infallible because it’s final; it’s not final because it’s infallible. So removing its finality or sharing its finality with other courts would remove its aura of infallibility.

Daily Bell: Do you respect all of the Supreme Court justices?

Judge Napolitano: Do you mean the human beings on the Court or their decisions? I know some of them very well. I disagree with some of them. I think some of them are agenda driven. Rarely do you see a return to first principals. Stated differently, I would be in the dissent in most of the major decisions in our era because, in my view, it would be inappropriate for the Court to be ruling on this, or the behavior of the government that the Court is violative of the natural law or the constitutional law. A broad sweeping statement and to be fair I would have to examine each case and this is generally where I come down on this because, to me, the individual is greater than the state and the natural law is superior to all other law. Very few Supreme Court justices in the modern era have accepted either of those first principals.

Daily Bell: Do you believe that all of them abide by the laws of the land?

Judge Napolitano: I don’t want to start a hypothetical dispute but I would say that few of them remain true to first principals.

Daily Bell: Are any of them ideologues?

Judge Napolitano: Yes.

Daily Bell: Do you have any final thoughts? Anything you want to say to readers that we didn’t ask about?

Judge Napolitano: I thoroughly enjoy these interviews. I love your audience. I love your product but we live in very bad and gloomy and dangerous times for freedom. Freedom is more threatened today, in my view, than at any time since Lincoln was in the White House. We are on the precipice of losing freedom. Freedom lies in our hearts but it must do more than lie there. We must exercise freedom and make it difficult for the government to take it away from us.

Daily Bell: Thanks for your time once again.

Judge Napolitano: Thank you.

Three times each week, 36-year-old Keith Briscoe of Winslow Township, New Jersey would begin his day by going to a nearby Wawa convenience store for soda and cigarettes. Briscoe, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and lived with his parents, went to the local Steininger Behavior Services clinic for treatment, and he would have a smoke outside the store while waiting for the office to open.

As far as anyone in the neighborhood could recall, Briscoe had never bothered anybody. He wasn’t causing trouble on the morning of May 3, 2010, when he had the lethal misfortune of attracting the attention of Winslow Township Police Officer Sean Richards.

When Richards demanded to know who he was and what he was doing, Briscoe was cooperative, telling the officer — who had no business bothering one of his betters anyway — that he was waiting to go to the clinic. Richards should have left well enough alone, but since he had a gun, a piece of government-provided jewelry, and an unearned sense of superiority, he didn’t. He demanded that Briscoe get into his police cruiser, supposedly to be given a ride to the clinic. Briscoe wisely turned down the offer.

Richards later admitted that he hadn’t received any complaints about Briscoe’s behavior, and that he did nothing that warranted an arrest. Yet when the harmless and intimidated man refused to get into the police car, Richards committed an act of criminal assault by seizing and attempting to handcuff him. As Briscoe tried to escape, Richards called for “backup.” He also attacked Briscoe with his Oleoresin Casicum spray, a “non-lethal” chemical weapon that left the victim choking and struggling for breath. At this point, three bystanders saw Briscoe struggling with a uniformed assailant, a situation that presented them with the “Tom Joad Test,” which I’ve previously described thus:

“When you see a cop — or, more likely, several of them — beating up on a prone individual, do you instinctively sympathize with the assailant(s) or the victim? Do you assume that the state is entitled to the benefit of the doubt whenever its agents inflict violence on somebody, or do you believe that the individual — any individual — is innocent of wrongdoing until his guilt has been proven?”

The bystanders failed the test. Rather than intervening on behalf of the victim, they reflexively gave the uniformed assailant the benefit of the doubt, and joined in the beating. Five more armed tax-feeders, summoned by Richards’s frantic call for “backup,” then arrived to pile on. A few minutes later, Briscoe was dead as a result of “traumatic asphyxia” — that is, he suffocated at the bottom of a thugscrum. The Camden County Medical Examiner ruled the death a homicide.

Richards, the chief assailant, was not charged with criminal homicide. According to the county prosecutor’s office, although Richards had committed an illegal arrest, he couldn’t be charged with homicide because New Jersey “law” doesn’t recognize the unalienable right of innocent people to resist unlawful arrest. This supposedly means that once Briscoe “resisted being taken into custody, police had the right to take actions necessary to restrain him” — up to and including the use of lethal force. Richards was charged with simple assault and as a result was sentenced to a year on probation and the loss of his job. He also agreed that he would never seek to expunge his record, although it’s not clear how that provision could be enforced.

“This plea ensures that Richards will be forever barred from holding such a position of authority again,” insisted Camden County Prosecutor Warren W. Faulk. Actually, it’s entirely possible that Richards will join the ranks of corrupt, disgraced “gypsy cops” who invariably find employment elsewhere as members of the coercive caste.

None of the other four police officers who collaborated in the crime has been punished at all. However, all five officers, along with the “Samaritans” who collaborated in the murder of Keith Briscoe, are the subjects of a $$25 million civil lawsuit filed on behalf of the victim’s family.

Legal commentator Elie Mystal points out that the “Good Samaritans” in this matter had no reason — apart from a “reflexive trust of police” — to assume that Sean Richards was justified in using force to subdue Briscoe. “They chose the wrong side, and now a man is dead,” Mystal observes. “There should be some kind of punishment for that.”

“And don’t tell me that holding these people accountable will have some kind of ‘chilling effect’ on the willingness of citizens to help their fellow man,” Mystal continues. “This is America! We are founded on a skepticism of authority. We believe that a person is innocent until proven guilty. It’s entirely consistent with the American experience … [not to assume] that police officers are always right or on the side of good.”

The Mundanes who joined in the assault will most likely end up ruined financially. The same is true of Sean Richards, now that he’s no longer wearing the habiliments of the State’s punitive priesthood. But the others still employed as agents of coercion will probably be spared similar hardship through a settlement worked out in collaboration with the local armed tax-feeders’ union.

And still, somehow we’re supposed to believe that the take-away here is that the lawsuit poses a new threat to “officer safety,” because it will discourage Mundanes from coming to the aid of police next time they assault a helpless individual.

“They saw a cop struggling and they jumped into action,” says Tim Quinlan, the attorney representing Sean Richards, of the Mundanes who helped murder Keith Briscoe. “Now you’re going to have cops getting killed because people are afraid to get involved.”

Somehow that unlikely prospect fails to send a chill down my spine, or leave me prostrate with inconsolable grief.

223116,"The Occupy Wall Street and Occupy Colleges movements are largely driven by citizens who are not able to pay off their debts. While Countrywide engaged in predatory lending that led to an enormous real estate bubble, Sallie Mae has taken a lot of heat for offering student loans to unworthy teenagers with unrealistic and impractical professional goals.

Student loans just came due this past November and December 2011, yet college graduates are in even more debt after earning their degrees.

Outstanding student loans are growing by approximately 5% every year and nearing an exorbitant $$1 trillion, surpassing even consumer credit card debt. Salaries are decreasing and college costs  along with living and medical expenses  are rising at an annual rate of 5%.

New Federal laws make it next to impossible for someone under 21 to get a simple credit card, yet the same people can obligate themselves to tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt with absolutely no problem, said SmartCredit.com President of Consumer Education John Ulzheimer. This, of course, makes no sense as student loan debt is arguably worse than credit card debt.

According to a recent New Yorker piece, almost 14% of college graduates from the classes of 2006 through 2010 cant find full-time work. Overall, 55.3% of people ages 16 to 29 have jobs  the lowest percentage since World War II. Today, one in five young adults lives below the poverty line.

If youre one of those individuals who made the ambitious move to take out student loans, Ulzheimer has four tips to help you fight the struggle:

1. Consolidate multiple loans into one giant one. Student loans are reported to the credit bureaus on a disbursement basis. For example, if you take out five loans to pay for college, then youll have five unpaid loans on your credit reports. The fewer the number of loans on your credit report, the better your credit score.

217452,"When the Winter Olympics came to Salt Lake City last year, some of the dirt that visiting journalists dug up to soil Utah’s good name was the issue of polygamy. Polygamy, the practice of having more than one spouse at the same time, especially wives, is against the law. But, should it be?

Opponents of polygamy will point to the abuses taking place in the twin cities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, as evidence it should be banned. But, like other moral crimes, such as illegal drug sales, prostitution, and gambling, when an activity is banned by the state, only criminal types will tend to engage in that activity because the rule of law and the rule of economics are not present to control the activity’s abuses.

Polygamists have congregated in an area on the Utah/Arizona border because the remote location makes enforcing anti-polygamy laws expensive and difficult. Because of this isolation, abuses run rampant, with old men marrying dozens of teenage brides. Unfortunately, life in Colorado City will not likely change anytime soon, as Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff told People magazine, ""There may be 40,000 polygamists in Utah alone. We do not have near the resources to go after [all of them].""

A few radical Mormon offshoot sects, like the Fundamentalist Church of Latter-Day Saints, continue to promote and practice polygamy primarily for religious and criminal reasons, not the economic reasons (a shortage of men) of the Mormons who settled in the West years ago.

The marriage market is like any other. Exchange is made when each party, seller and buyer, perceive that each will benefit from the transaction. Available men and women have value in the marriage marketplace. Some are more valuable than others, based upon: ability to provide for a family, looks, personality, ability to have children, etc.

If there is a shortage of women in a particular area, the value of all women will increase.

Legalizing polygamy, as economist David Friedman wrote in his book Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life, ""allows some men who before wanted one wife to try to marry two instead — provided that they are willing to offer terms at which potential wives are willing to accept half a husband apiece. So the demand curve for wives shifts out. The supply curve stays the same, the demand curve shifts out, so the price must go up. Women are better off.""

If men can have more than one wife, the price of wives in the marketplace goes up. Because of this increase in demand, with no increase in supply (the number of women is still the same), men must offer more value to women to entice them into marriage and keep them.

Some readers may have trouble with the idea that all women would benefit if polygamy laws were abolished. Friedman crystallizes the argument by substituting cars and car buyers for wives and husbands. ""Suppose there were a law forbidding anyone to own more than one car,"" wrote Friedman. ""The abolition of that law would increase the demand for cars. Sellers of cars would be better off. Buyers who did not take advantage of the new opportunity would be worse off, since they would have to pay a higher price. Buyers who bought more than one car would be better off than if they bought only one car at the new price (otherwise that is what they would have done) but not necessarily better off than if they bought one car at the old price, an option no longer open to then.""

Because polygamy is illegal, most of the wives in Colorado City are viewed by the state as single mothers. Thus, bigamists collect thousands in government aid every month. It is ironic that taxpayers are supporting the lifestyle of a few deviant men, who hide behind their religious beliefs. Recognition of these marriages would stop this welfare fraud.

With legalization — or, better, the privatization of marriage — there will be a few men (and women) with multiple spouses, but not many. The fact of the matter is most people don’t offer enough value for potential spouses to consider sharing.

A free market would sort out the polygamy issue, but as it is now, because polygamy is outlawed, only outlaws are polygamists.

459019,"Back in the day, I fell in [political] love with a guy named J. Peter Grace. Reagan had asked him to head up a commission to study waste and abuse in and by the federal government. The Commission produced a large report, entitled War on Waste. Grace shared the commission’s discoveries in another aptly titled book Burning Money: The Waste of Your Tax Dollars. Unlike the more recent 9/11 Commission Report, also published as a book, the Grace Commission Report contained serious information that many of us didn’t already know from reading the newspapers, and its actionable and specific recommendations could have made a real difference in the future security of this country.

Not that any specific action was taken, of course. Reagan presided over a fifty-year metastasization of the New Deal. But compared to the present day, government spending in the early 1980s was downright stingy. Thirty years of easy money, corporate capitalism and military adventurism doesn’t wear well on a country.

The so-called Reagan revolution is proof that wanting smaller government isn’t the same as getting it. By the end of his presidency, every bad thing — that is to say everything — about our federal government had increased radically. Sheldon Richman summarized the Reagan legacy in 1988, and it’s worth re-reading today.

Only a brave American, a suicidal Constitutionalist, or a sadistic Bolshevik would wish to honestly contemplate the frightening summary of government growth that will be written at the end of 2008. But perhaps the withering away of the state is still possible.

I was reminded of Peter Grace because in this age of recession and belt-tightening, it is only natural to start looking at waste in our government, and demanding the fat be returned to the ""people."" It is telling that a major selling point of the bailout, and its legionary spawn, is that we (the ""people"") could turn a profit, or at least, the bailout would ""cost the taxpayer nothing.""

But here’s a better idea, a new deal of sorts. Giveaways, special interest exceptions, and pleasing the masses — well, that’s how it works. It’s what politicians understand, so let’s expand the program! Throw some new interest groups a bone! For starters, let’s get the antiwar crowd to stop whining. Immediately end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan — that’ll stop the fiscal bleeding and forestall a few trillion dollars, plus it will stop creating future liabilities of more terrorism aimed at Americans, more countries to ""rebuild,"" and more sick and crippled soldiers to maintain for life.

The peace brigades are also unhappy with the American bases or ongoing deployments in 150 countries, and a half a trillion bucks every year just for maintenance of the Pentagon and its profligate and self-indulgent lifestyle. Some may ask, ""Isn’t that the price of freedom?"" Clearly, it buys damn little of the ethereal stuff. Burdened by a national debt that is rising as we breathe and amounts to $$35,000 a person, and an entitlement crisis that adds a $$100,000 more per taxpayer — does any American feel more free? Does any American, confused over whether to vote for the national or the international socialist on November 4th, feel that he or she has more choice?

Another interest group ignored for years by Congress and Presidents are the small ""c"" conservatives. As we approach national bankruptcy, these ""Warriors Against Government Waste"" are a rising tide, sure to demand their ""take"" from a Congress that soon will have little choice but to oblige them.

Other groups that deserve some policy goodies and legislative bones are the Ron Paul Revolutionaries who understand sound money, third-party constituencies focused on fundamental issues like liberty, the Constitution, and justice, and every generation in the country that is paying the social security and Medicare benefits for the generation that is receiving it. Obviously, there is some overlap among these groups, and contradictions in priorities. But taken together, it is a monster majority of special interests that will conspire together for a severely reduced and constrained federal government.

While our wasteful, desperate security policy around the globe is a well of near-instant potential savings, the low-hanging fruit today, as it was in the 1980s, is domestic spending. Every American schoolchild (even those who cannot name the Vice President) knows what an earmark is. They have all heard of the bridge to nowhere, and they know what it means. It’s time to abolish federal departments like Veterans Affairs and Education, and not stop until Homeland Security is completed gutted. When I say gutted, please don’t get the serrated blades out just yet — let’s simply split the assets (and the future budget requests) among the states. Most states have balanced budget amendments, and actual semi-accountable assemblies, congresses, and governors. Let them conduct the firesales.

Perhaps Obama or McCain will appoint another commission to look at potential government savings — as the federal government goes broke and broker, maybe this time angry Democrats and angrier Republicans in the House will decide to eat their young, sacrifice their unholy children (or dare I say wealthy grandparents?) at the altar of political survival.

We worry that it can’t happen here — but American fascism has already arrived, in fact, it has been living in the heartland, and our cities and suburbs for a long time. Others predict that as our government senses it is losing control, it will cling ever more vigorously to power and authority like a cat on a high branch, that our limited freedoms of today may be reduced even further if we demand too much, too soon.

Some believe that our government will launch another war to distract us, or to get the economy going. It does appear to be true that our federal government has an array of potential prison camps all over the country, in every state, waiting to be filled, with contracts for prison guards waiting only to be funded.

The naming and formation of Department of Homeland Security was no hysterical accident. America’s expensive domestic programs and adventuristic foreign policy follow a well-worn historical path. These developments — as with every action of our federal government — are designed to promote, maintain or salvage federal institutional capability to continue the plunder. It’s the same old deal, grown unreasonable, unaffordable, and unbearable.

In November 1934, folks in Indiana sent Charles Halleck to Congress to rein in FDR’s New Deal. In 1936, Halleck said, ""The social experimentation and reckless extravagance of the New Deal are on the way out because the common sense of the people is reasserting itself."" He went on to say, ""We must be free of annoyance…of restrictions which cramp …our lives… . We must be allowed to work, to invest, and to save without making out a bureaucratic blank for every move we make.""

Today, America is populated by people who demand instant messages, and refuse to waste a millisecond typing a single unnecessary vowel. As LRC contributor Becky Akers pointed out recently, bilingual 6-year olds in America choose to converse with their friends in English not because anyone tells them to, or because they want to be patriotic, but because ""it’s faster.""

Obama and McCain both salivate for neo-FDR status, and a New Deal of their own, conceived by fellow politicians, and tenderly nurtured like a hothouse flower. Instead, the next New Deal will be put to government as a trompement by fast-moving, waste-intolerant, outrageously irreverent people who not only treasure liberty, but expect it.

48498,"One of the world’s best female tennis players, Maria Sharapova, has been suspended, because a medicine she has been taking legally under a doctor’s prescription for ten years was suddenly retroactively declared to be a prohibited substance that is a “metabolic modulator.”

The medicine, known as mildronate and also as meldonium in its banned name, has been in medical use for thirty years. Its inventor declared that the prohibition of mildronate “is a crime” and will lead to deaths among athletes. He says that it has not been proven that the medicine enhances athlete performance, but it does protect their hearts from over-exertion.

Mildronate is used to treat heart problems, magnesium deficiency, and diabetes. Sharapova suffers from magnesium deficiency. There is diabetes in her family history, and doctors saw signs that she was developing the disease.

The medicine is not designed to improve athletic performance. However, the medicine does protect athletes’ hearts as they push to their limits. Apparently it is this aspect of the medicine that caused the World Anti-Doping Agency to conclude that the medicine facilitates recovery from exertion and, thereby, enhances physical capabilities. The Neoconservative Th... Dr. Paul Craig Roberts Best Price: $15.00 Buy New $19.88 (as of 11:50 EST - Details)

It is immaterial to my point whether the medicine’s inventor or WADA is correct. My point is that for a widely used legal substance to be put on a prohibited list for athletes, there should first be the public discussion. If the decision to prohibit the medicine is shown to be warranted, there should be enough advance notice provided so that athletes using the medicine for health reasons such as diabetes or magnesium deficiency, or to protect their heart from failing under exertion, have time to clear their bodies of traces.

This was not done. The medicine was added to the prohibited list on January 1 under the name of meldonium, a name that Sharapova did not recognize. Even if she had been aware that her medicine had been banned, there was not sufficient time between January 1 and the January Australian Open for her to be clear of the substance. WADA’s decision was made in a way that guaranteed that Sharapova would fail the test, a test she has always passed in her rise to dominance in women’s tennis. Other than WADA’s incompetence, it is difficult to read this other than WADA accepted a bribe to eliminate Sharapova from the Australian Open and subsequent events.

Examining this matter from the standpoint of the facts, it is unclear whether WADA consists of a bunch of incompetent and inconsiderate dopes who were unaware of the medicinal use of meldonium, or whether this is an orchestrated stunt to cast more discredit on Russia and Russian athletes.

Perhaps what we are witnessing is an attempt on the part of less capable American and Europeans to move aside dominant Russian athletes in order to be able to capture their lucrative endorsements. Nike, Tag Heuer, and Porsche suspended their contracts with Sharapova. Such cowardly behavior speaks poorly of the integrity of the three companies. The absence of loyalty and support that the companies have shown to their star associate raises questions about the character of the companies’ managements and the quality of their products.

As the record proves that Sharapova’s use of the medicine is clearly for medical, not performance, reasons, perhaps she will be reinstated by the International Tennis Federation. But the Tennis Federation, like most other institutions, might be under Washington’s thumb and used as an instrument of US foreign policy.

Even if she is reinstated, the Tennis Federation, WADA, and her sponsors have succeeded in messing with her mind. WADA official Dick Pound, who is trying to get Russian athletes banned from the 2016 Olympic Games in Brazil, demonstrated his own lack of integrity when he seized on Sharapova to boost his anti-Russian propaganda, declaring that she was “reckless beyond description” and guilty of “a big mistake.” As there is no justification for Pound’s irresponsible assertions, it raises questions about the integrity of WADA itself.

An athlete’s mental state is more important to the athlete’s performance than performance-enhancing drugs. I was disappointed to see that even RT misrepresented Sharapova’s situation as “explosive news” that she had “failed a drug test.” She did no such thing! She was trapped, perhaps purposely, by the sudden inclusion under a different name of a medicine she has been taking for a decade under medical supervision.

Until Sharapova is reinstated, competitors will benefit from less strenuous competition.

I remember from my studies of post-Roman Europe that various rulers to the extent that they could mint coins featured the Roman Emperor on the coins, not themselves. The reason for this, I was told, is that people associated coinage with Rome and were accustomed to a Roman image. To make their coinage acceptable, petty kings identified their coins with Rome.

Perhaps this is what we are witnessing today in Russia and China’s acceptance of Western domination. The United States and Europe—the West—comprise the hallmark of approval. Russia and China, despite their independent power, desire this approval. The West knows that Russia and China seek approval and denies it to them as an assertion of the West’s superiority.

It is not Russia and China that destroyed seven countries in the past 15 years. It was Washington and its European vassals. It is not Washington that is accused of human rights violations that are so severe that millions of peoples are fleeing into Europe in order to escape death at the hands of the Americans. It is Russia’s attack on ISIS that is blamed for the European refugee problem. It is Russia and China that are accused of human rights violations, not the real perpetrators—Washington and its vassals.

The West uses disapproval as a weapon. Washington disapproved the Sochi Olympics. While Putin was in Sochi, Washington overthrew the government of Ukraine and created a problem for Russia. While Putin was at the Beijing Olympics, Washington gave the go ahead to its Georgian puppet to attack South Ossetia and to kill Russian peacekeepers. Certainly, Putin should not go to the Brazilian Olympics this year. Washington might overthrow Putin in his absence. Certainly, Washington wants to be rid of Putin, and so do the Russian Atlanticist Integrationists whose sole ambition is to be an approved part of the West. Just as Washington had its Ukrainian puppet government lined up to take office once Washington overthrew Yanukovych, Washington has Atlanticist Integrationists lined up as its puppet government to take over Russia.

It is ironic that it is the hallmarked West, not the disapproved countries, that is in decline, culurally, morally, spiritually, and economically. Why do Russia, China, India, and every other country free of US imperial domination desire to be associated with a corrupt, immoral, declining part of the world whose economic and political existence depends on extending its hegemony over the remaining productive parts of the world in order to loot the countries for the benefit of the West?

Why are Russia and China concerned that they receive the approval of the West?

375016,"The unctuous pseudo-grief in the West after Nelson Mandela’s death at the good age of 95 was to me nauseating in the extreme; it was so overdone that, though I am no Freudian, it raised suspicions in my mind of reaction formation, the psychological defense mechanism against unwanted thoughts described by Freud that leads to exaggerated expressions of precisely opposite thoughts. The Guardian and the Observer, Britain’s two foremost liberal-left newspapers, had between them approximately fifty broadsheet pages devoted to Mandela, many times more than the return and re-crucifixion of Christ would have received. Methinks these newspapers (and many others) did protest too much.

This is not to say that Mandela was without importance or that he merited no praise. His greatest achievement by far, and an important one, was the avoidance of the interracial violence that had long been predicted as “inevitable” in South Africa and the only way things would ever change there. He did this by his dignity and lack of rancor after his release from prison and during his presidency, the first presidency post-apartheid. For example, his enthusiasm for the South African team in the rugby World Cup, whether genuine or not, was a wise and shrewd way of trying to prove that South African patriotism should transcend racial divides, for of course the team was mostly white. No better way of calming fears symbolically could well have been imagined; Mandela played the part to perfection, and all honor to him for that.

But we should not exaggerate, either. The event that saved his historical reputation was not under his control. It was the downfall of the Soviet Union, for it was surely not a coincidence that the un-banning of the African National Congress and the release of Mandela himself happened only after the implosion of the Soviet bloc. Until then the Communist Party of South Africa, both the most Stalinist and the most resolutely pro-Soviet of communist parties anywhere (not always an easy balance to preserve), had what in Soviet langue de bois was called “a leading role” in the ANC.

214681,"“People just have no margin,” explained Dennis Gartman, whom we met in Vancouver. “I have a friend who is a mortgage broker. He tells me that clients will figure out their monthly budgets to within $$5. That’s how much they have left over after their foreseeable expenses.”

When a credit bubble expands, the lenders make a lot of money. But when it contracts, the loan business goes sour.

Countrywide Financial and Capital One are two of the biggest lenders in America. Their stocks are falling — down 15% to 20% from their peaks.

We are seeing — we think — a “Farewell to ARMs,” as we put it on Friday in our speech to the Agora Wealth Symposium. Rising rates, and the threat of rising rates, is killing the lending industry.

Friday’s papers also brought news of two trends that may be destined to increase the destruction far beyond the credit business. Inflation was reported rising at the fastest rate half from the first quarter to the second. These twin trends are heralds of stagflation, the first in 12 years. Meanwhile, GDP growth is declining — the rate of economic growth fell in scourge of central banking.

We remind readers how stagflation comes about (and why Ben Bernanke is doomed):

The Keynesian economics practiced by governments and central bankers depends on deception. As more money and credit is introduced into the economy — as “stimulus” — it is mistaken for real wealth. Consumers think they have more money to spend; businessmen think they have more customers; investors think they see more profits. Deceived, they happily expand the economy. As time goes on, however, prices catch up to the funny money and the consumer wakes up to the fact that he or she is no better off than before. The businessman finds that though he has more customers, he must also pay his workers more. And his supplies cost more, too. The investor sees that he did not really make any money; profits disappeared as costs rose and the gain on his stock barely equaled the general loss of purchasing power of the dollar.

So, gradually, the old trick stops working. Money and credit may pour in, but no one is fooled. Instead, prices rise, while the economy goes limp.

This was what Paul Volcker faced when he stepped into the Fed back in the late ’70s. He had to whip inflation — or more precisely, inflation expectations — before any further monetary stimulus would work. And this he did, by pushing lending rates up over 15% and bringing about the worst recession since the 1930s. People were so upset with him they burned him in effigy on the capital steps.

Now, what will Ben Bernanke do? The poor man finds a different world from the one his immediate predecessor ruled over. Alan Greenspan took the post after Volcker had already raised rates. Greenspan could ride them down for the next 15 years. But now rates are low, and who wants to ride them up? If present trends continue, Bernanke will need to raise rates to fight inflation. But he will also need to cut rates to fight the incipient slump.

The man is trapped. He’s spent his career studying how to avoid a Japanese-style slump — an off-again, on-again deflationary recession extending over a long period of time. And now, he has one staring him in the face. He desperately wants to cut rates to head it off. But then, what about inflation?

And if he tries to pull a Volcker — jacking up rates to squeeze out inflationary expectation — the lumpen are likely to burn him for real!

We think again of Alan Greenspan. The man must have to back into elevators and shave in the dark. How can he bear to look himself in the eyes? His easy money policies have wreaked havoc on the landscape of the United States. Gone are the sturdy independent homesteads. In their place are shaky plastic lean-tos and flimsy vinyl shacks held up by debt. And debt of the worst sort: ARMs — adjustable-rate debt.

Adjust the rates upward just a couple percentage points and the things will collapse in a heap.

Oh those ARMS! If Bernanke hikes rates to fight inflation, the ARMs go up. And then the hands go up, voting for a change in government. Finally, the stakes and tinder are prepared. Bernanke must smell the smoke already…

u2022 Making our way back from Vancouver, we had the pleasure of a couple idle hours in the business waiting-lounge at Heathrow Airport in London. There, we witnessed the most remarkable thing: television. There was one in the waiting room that apparently couldn’t be disabled, so we had to endure it out of the corner of our eye.

What we found took our breath away: a group of dissolute young people acting like complete jackasses in front of the camera. They laid around in various settings, sometimes putting on strange get-ups, often jumping up and down and hugging each other. The show seemed to go on forever. Big Brother, it is called.

u2022 At last, a political candidate we can get behind.

Kinky Friedman is running for governor of the state of Texas as a “compassionate redneck.” We remember Kinky from his days as a rock and roller when he had his own band, Kinky Friedman and the Texas Jewboys. Later, he took up writing, turning out such classics of detective stories as “Armadillos and Old Lace,” and “Kill Two Birds and Get Stoned.”

Kinky’s campaign slogan appeals to our own Essentialist sense of modesty: “I Can’t Screw Things Up Any Worse Than They Have.” Accused of drinking beer while driving at the head of the recent St. Patrick’s Day parade in Dallas, Kinky says: “I admit I did drink the Guinness, but I did not swallow.”

The candidate has a solution to education financing. He proposes to legalize gambling and use the money to pay for schools. “Slots for Tots,” he calls it. And he may be the only candidate in the country who supports gay marriage and compulsory prayer in the public schools…as well as converting all the state’s school buses to run on biodiesel fuel. Yes, Kinky has the usual assortment of fashionable claptrap and a few bad ideas of his own, but at least he doesn’t seem to be serious about them.

“The death penalty? I’m all over the map. I’m not anti it, but I’m anti the wrong guy getting executed…at least I never killed anybody. Not even Ted Kennedy can say that.”

218552,"""The ally you must always seek is the part of your enemy that knows what is right.""

~ Gandhi

A few months ago, I wrote on the Lew Rockwell web site about my successful experience helping fight a local sales tax increase. (See ""The Reluctant Activist,"" ""How To Stop a Tax Increase, part 1"", ""How To Stop a Tax Increase, part 2""). The tax revenues would have gone to bail out Natividad, a government-run hospital in Salinas, California, that had been in financial trouble many times before.

A couple of weeks ago, something happened as a result of that fight, something that I think is important enough to report here. It involved a prominent local politician who was on the other side of the sales tax fight and who tried to take the moral high ground in a conversation with me. After the sales tax fight, I had reread Suzette Haden Elgin’s 1980 classic, The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense because I realized that it would have come in handy during the sales-tax debate. In it, she shows how to recognize when you’re being put down and how to parry in an honorable way rather than in kind. I can’t say that in the event I’m about to relate I used anything specific that I learned from her book, but the basic spirit and tone of her book helped me be effective. Here’s what happened.

I was having lunch in a popular Monterey restaurant where one seats oneself. I saw the aforementioned politician looking around for a table to sit at and, because the restaurant was crowded, having trouble finding one. I waved at him and invited him over to my table. I would name this person, but he comes off looking partly good and partly bad — fortunately, the good came after the bad — and my point is not to single him out. I like him, and, especially in a small community like mine, I want to get along with him. In any case, my point does not depend on his identity.

I had met this man a number of times — our daughters attended the same local private school and we had seen each other at some of the girls’ games. Also, we had both been on a panel at my daughter’s school the year earlier in which we had both spoken out against the war on Iraq. He had always been friendly and polite to me, which made what happened next surprising. (Author’s note: I probably wasn’t as articulate as the following story suggests, but each quote is as accurate as I can remember, except that I’ve avoided grammatical errors, something I’m not sure I did in the moment.)

He explained that he was waiting for another friend to show up and that he would just stand while waiting for her. Then he said, ""So, you’re the guy who wants Natividad to close its doors."" There was a lot of anger in his voice.

""’Scuse me?"" I said, stunned by his manner, and figuring that once he realized how nasty he was being he would stop.

""You’re the guy who wants Natividad to close,"" he repeated.

""You’re putting words in my mouth,"" I replied. ""You think that without the tax increase, Natividad would close, and you have the right to think that. But don’t go telling me what I want or think.""

""Well, how’s it going to stay open without that money?"" he asked.

""I have some thoughts about that, and I’m willing to tell you them in a minute,"" I replied, ""but for us to have this discussion, you need to stop telling me what I think. You can tell me what you think and I can tell you what I think and we can discuss our thoughts, but please don’t tell me what I think.""

""So what would you do to make sure low-income people can get health care?"" he asked.

I answered, ""I would have massive deregulation, so that it would be easier for people to be doctors. The increased supply of doctors would bring the price down. I would have massive deregulation of health insurance, getting rid of mandated benefits so that low-income people would be able to buy catastrophic health insurance at a fairly low price. I would deregulate drug development and sales and the result would be drugs on the market much more quickly than now."" I had given him the very brief version of the reforms I lay out in the health care chapter of my book, The Joy of Freedom: An Economist’s Odyssey.

""I think we have a responsibility to help poorer people get health care,"" he said.

""I can see that,"" I said, ""but no one has the right to force someone to provide health care for poor people and that’s what taxes do.""

""Do you have employer-provided health insurance?"" he asked. I knew where he was going, but my policy is to be honest in discussions and not try to wriggle out of traps that people try to set.

""Yes,"" I answered.

""Well then it’s easy for you to advocate not having the government pay for people’s health care when you’ve already got health insurance.""

""Actually,"" I replied, ""I’m a health economist and I was the health economist with President Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers. I would’ve been a pretty lousy health economist if I had based any of my health policy views on whether I did or didn’t have health insurance.""

That went right by him. ""The reason you’re against subsidizing health care for others is that you already have health insurance,"" he said angrily.

""Bill, you’re making an ad hominem,"" I answered. ""You don’t know me nearly well enough to know my reasons for my views. If you want to argue with my views, that’s fine, but don’t argue against my views by challenging my motives.""

Something clicked. I think it was the phrase ""ad hominem."" Just as suddenly as he attacked, he understood what I was saying. ""You’re right,"" he said, ""I apologize.""

""Apology accepted,"" I said.

""But you have to understand,"" he said, ""that I feel passionate about this.""

""It’s natural to be passionate,"" I answered, ""but passion never justifies an ad hominem.""

""You’re right,"" he replied, ""but I feel so passionate about this.""

""No problem,"" I answered, ""but just because you’re passionate, that doesn’t make it alright to make an ad hominem argument."" I was simply unwilling for him to have the last word if the last word was the implicit assumption that passion justifies challenging someone’s character rather than his argument.

""You’re right,"" he replied, and then apologized once more.

Then he decided to discuss rather than attack and we had a good discussion. If you’re interested in that discussion, read on. But if you stop here, I’ve accomplished my main goal with this article, namely, laying out the absolute importance of not letting your opponent get away with nasty treatment of you. By challenging him on this and not letting the discussion proceed until we had resolved this, I was the one getting him to apologize and I claimed the moral high ground. That’s probably not what he expected when he started the discussion.

Now, on to our discussion. I laid out a little more detail about some of the reforms I advocated and he listened. Interestingly, this man, who, at one point, had almost become one of my elected representatives, didn’t try to refute anything I said. I doubt that he believed what I said, but I don’t know. Instead, he asked, ""How long do you think it would take to implement these reforms?""

""Probably a few years,"" I said, thinking about all the minds that would have to be changed to get a truly free market in health care.

""And meanwhile what do you do about all the people who need health care and can’t afford it?"" he asked.

""That’s a fair question,"" I answered. ""But to put it in perspective, very few people go without health care now. And the few who do can be supported voluntarily by the rest of us."" Then I decided to take a page out of the left’s rhetoric. ""If we say that we won’t fix the problem but instead keep spending taxpayers’ money on it, then we’ll never get around to fixing the underlying problem. We’ve got to go to the root of the problem and not just treat symptoms.""

At about this point, his friend showed up and the three of us got talking about the war on Iraq, something we were all against. Interestingly, I noticed how much he and she personalized the war. For them, it was all about George W. Bush being foolish and/or venal. I wondered whether they would have been against the war had President Al Gore taken the exact same steps. But that’s another story.

736631,"There is a popular television show on FOX called 24. It’s about a special agent from an imaginary Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU) who bends the rules to keep America safe from evildoers. Sounds like a show George and Dick might enjoy, right?

Before I continue — I am not a ""24"" junkie. But I do know that each season takes a tour around the clock (24 segments). Every show is presented as a single consecutive hour in the day and night of national security.

I watched last Monday’s episode, and was amazed at its libertarian and anti-state message. It is a great day when one of the most popular TV shows in America might be viewed with appreciation by Thomas Jefferson and H.L. Mencken.

Here’s why.

There is an early scene where two government analysts fight over a computer that has a special capability. The inability to prioritize, the personal quirks of civil servants doing the ""work of the people,"" and the authoritarian way it was solved were both entertaining and typical of how our tax dollars are employed. Cute. We get it.

The Evil Terrorists are tricky, but the CTU agents use a massive national driver’s license database and other networked systems (yeah, we get that too!) to find a guy who knows a guy.

Oh — I forgot to mention — the president’s plane crashed earlier that evening, and he is now in critical condition. The nuclear football/briefcase was stolen by the Evil Terrorists, who also had a lead on a guy who drove a truck with a nuke on it. As I understand it, this lowly driver was first bought and then butchered by the Evil Terrorists who bought him, and they got the nuke. ""Bought, then butchered"" might also be a libertarian message of sorts!

The Vice President has now been appointed president. He appears to be an emotionally driven coward. We know this because his lips quaver and he says things like ""Is it safe to come up now?"" One might think that the new president is the Anti-Bush, but in fact the opposite seems to be true. You’ll see in a minute.

So they bring the guy who knows a guy in, and he won’t talk. The CTU would like to pressure him (i.e., inflict a little pain) so they call the President. This, dear reader, in a nutshell, illustrates the nanny state. Federalism taken to its Terri Schiavo extreme. Oh, dear! What to do? We must immediately call the president! He’ll solve our problem.

But of course, the new president is indecisive. Bush-like, he can’t tell right from wrong, so he waits for his attorney general (significantly, a man who never shows up) to tell him. For TV, and in government, real logic destroys the plot line and fractures the tension. But — typically for government decision-making — the solution (torture the guy) is articulated before the problem (a multifaceted system problem of a missing nuke). It immediately becomes the argumentative focus, and then precious time is spent in justifying this single simple solution instead of solving the real problem. Apparently, the real multifaceted response is all up to Jack Bauer, the hero of ""24.""

I’ve just noted several examples of the anti-state perspective of ""24."" Enter the individualistic libertarian hero. Jack first tenders his resignation, becomes free of the government, and then tortures the guy himself, gaining the information and more shocking — taking full personal responsibility! In an age of Abu Ghraib, you have to love that. I will serve my country as an individual torturer, but not as a member of the state apparatus where I might be protected from blame (as were the long line of senior officers just last week).

In dealing with torture, the script writers ventured into libertarian land where individuals do what they believe is right and take full responsibility for their actions. I’m still in a state of shock. What would this mean if we applied it to Social Security, the welfare state, the EPA, the Education and the Defense Departments? My goodness, it’s just plain frightening.

More significantly, it wasn’t his loss of federal position or possible state punishment that bothered Jack Bauer, but the possible moral condemnation of his friends. And he appeared to be bothered by his decision. Humanity challenges the state at its very core.

The drama continues. The cowardly emotional president becomes angered that his ""no torture until I talk to my Attorney General"" wishes were disobeyed by Jack, the momentary civilian. He now demands in a rage that his Secret Service arrest Jack in the middle of the terrorist capture. Which they do, disrupting the mission, allowing the terrorists to escape, and saying the classic words, ""Sorry, we are just following orders.""

The expected audience response is one of healthy disgust for duplicative, no-value added and order-obeying government employees and representatives of Washington. For a TV show to present and celebrate this libertarian perspective for millions of adoring fans in America is nothing short of a miracle. It was the Secret Service on Monday. Homeland Defense and the U.S. Congress, FOX is coming for you next!

The Evil Terrorist prepared the obligatory video explaining why he was blowing up a nuke on American soil. E.T. (Evil Terrorist) Marwan explained he was attacking the US because American citizens had allowed their government to run amok in the world, interfering where it knew nothing, and claiming foreign lands as its own. It was right out of George Washington’s farewell speech.

But it was the final scene in last Monday’s ""24"" that screamed libertarianism. The female computer analyst is sent, untrained and unprepared, on a field mission to pick up an E.T. laptop. She has a small team of government protectors, who are immediately killed by the terrorist out to get back his computer. The woman analyst manages not only to escape, but to phone back to the CTU and request immediate assistance.

Panicked and ineffectual, the CTU says it will be at least ten or fifteen minutes, as the government struggles to heave its many layers of ""citizen defense"" to the task at hand. If she relies on the state, she will die. In the end, the analyst (now being shot at and rammed by the E.T.’s vehicle) gets out of her bulletproof government car, stands up, and fires directly at the E.T. and blows him away.

She would have done it sooner, but the guns were locked up in the back seat of the government vehicle.

Individualism versus the state, in a hundred ways, in less than an hour.

I don’t like to recommend TV. I do enjoy Sponge Bob Square Pants, whose advice for his cohort who wishes to take over the world, is honestly and simply, ""Good luck with that.""

But ""24"" has real libertarian potential. Enjoy!

226020,"Recently by Thomas Sowell: The Big Hoax

Many years ago, I learned of an episode in the life of a promising young black man that is relevant to things happening now. He had been educated at a good school, and went on to receive degrees at good colleges and universities. Then he went for a Ph.D. in mathematics at one of the leading departments in that field.

When he encountered difficulties, his professors essentially wrote his doctoral thesis for him. No doubt they felt good about doing something to help a promising young black man, and perhaps took pride in doing so. But what about his pride?

This young man ended up joining an extremist group that hated white people.

Would it have been worse if he had not gotten a Ph.D. in math? Probably 99 percent of the people in this country, regardless of race, could not get a Ph.D. in math — and yet they can still live happy and fulfilling lives.

What recalled this episode from long ago was the current flurry of interest in a video of a young Barack Obama at the Harvard law school praising Derrick Bell, a black professor there, whose writings on “critical race theory” promoted an extremist hostility to white people.

Derrick Bell was for years a civil rights lawyer, but not an academic legal scholar of the sort who gets appointed as a full professor at one of the leading law schools. Yet he became a visiting professor at the Stanford law school and was a full professor at the Harvard law school.

It was transparently obvious in both cases that his appointment was because he was black, not because he had the qualifications that got other people appointed to these faculties. At Stanford, his students complained that his course on constitutional law was not up to the standards of the other courses they were taking.

Stanford at that time had one of the leading scholars in constitutional law, Professor Gerald Gunther — and Derrick Bell was no Gerald Gunther. A hastily created program of study of constitutional law was then used to teach that subject to students who were not getting what they needed in Professor Bell’s course.

When this clever finessing of the problem came to light, the administration apologized — to Derrick Bell for the embarrassment this caused him.

They should have apologized to the law students for short-changing them with a professor who was not up to the job — and to those who donated money to the university to advance the cause of education, not to allow administrators to play racial quota politics on campus.

As a full professor at the Harvard law school, Derrick Bell was also surrounded by colleagues who were out of his league as academic scholars. What were his options at this point?

If he played it straight, he could not expect to command the respect of either faculty or students at the Harvard law school — or, more important, his own self-respect. Bell himself admitted that he did not have the scholarly credentials that most full professors at the Harvard law school have.

There were no doubt other law schools where he would have been a respected colleague, but these were not Stanford or Harvard. Yet it is worth remembering that millions of people have led happy and fulfilling lives without ever being at Harvard or Stanford.

Derrick Bell’s options were to be a nobody, living in the shadow of more accomplished legal scholars — or to go off on some wild tangent of his own, and appeal to a radical racial constituency on campus and beyond.

His writings showed clearly that the latter was the path he chose. His previous writings had been those of a sensible man saying sensible things about civil rights issues that he understood from his years of experience as an attorney. But now he wrote all sorts of incoherent speculations and pronouncements, the main drift of which was that white people were the cause of black people’s problems.

Bell even said that he took it as his mission to say things to annoy white people. Perhaps he thought that was better than being insignificant in his academic setting. But it was in fact far worse, because the real damage was to impressionable young blacks who took him seriously, including one who went on to become President of the United States.

736052,"Downsizing is on its way. It’s going to happen, but we don’t know what forms it will take. Let wiser minds or prophets make those specific predictions. What we all can be certain of is that cutbacks and retrenchments lie not too far ahead for Americans. They will begin within a rather short time, say five to ten years.

There are ways to have the downsizing be highly beneficial in an overall sense, and there are ways for it to make us a lot worse off. It depends on what we choose to downsize.

No matter whether in the aggregate we make ourselves better off or shoot ourselves, somebody’s oxen will be gored. Whose oxen will be gored and how will the goring be done? No one knows. There are only so many possibilities. We may not be able to foresee which ones will happen, but we can map out the possibilities.

Why we’re in trouble

The reason for the downsizing is that the promises made by the Federal Government far exceed the money available to pay for those promises, based on current money flowing into the U.S. Treasury. The Feds are slated to pay out a lot more than they are now taking in, and the kind of growth we normally get in the economy won’t be great enough to increase the Federal Government’s usual share of the take to pay for all their promises.

Suppose you ran a business and promised every employee a bonus 5 years from now, a new house paid for by the company. Suppose a parent promised each child a bonus 5 years from now, a $$500,000 fully paid for college education. But suppose that these are promises that couldn’t be kept under current circumstances because the business and the parent were not making enough money. There would have to be retrenchment at some point in some form falling upon someone.

Cash inflow has to equal cash outflow, or sources of money have to equal uses of money in a given period. If a family’s cash inflows are $$50,000 in a year, that $$50,000 will unavoidably flow into uses of the money. Maybe $$5,000 is saved, $$5,000 given away, and the remaining $$40,000 spent. It will all be accounted for in one way or another.

If the family’s promised outflows next year suddenly become $$100,000 and the inflows are still slated to be $$50,000, something has to give. Either (1) the promises have to be cut back, or (2) the family has to earn more, or (3) the family has to steal from someone, or (4) the family has to borrow, or (5) the family has to sell off some of its existing assets. I ignore getting this much from charity.

This is not far from depicting the situation of the Federal Government. Its future promises far, far exceed its future income. These promises comprise every single item of federal spending, such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, military spending, veterans’ pensions, debt and interest payments, etc. Its cash inflows come mainly from taxes, borrowing, and printing money with small amounts from other sources like fees and asset sales.

The Federal Government’s choices

Like the family, the government’s choices are few. It can cut back on its promises. Whose oxen might be gored, that is, who might find promises to them not being kept? Not creditors. The Feds will pay its legally obligated interest and debt payments. It has to if it doesn’t want to fail. The other promises depend on political clout. Social Security and Medicare benefits may, probably will, be cut back because that’s where big promises have been made. Military adventures overseas and the associated spending could and probably will be curtailed, especially as it becomes more and more evident that the money is being wasted. All depends on politics. But the odds are overwhelming that some promises made will be broken. The Federal Government is under no legal obligation to keep its non-debt promises. There are no entitlements it can’t alter. There will be heated debates. There will be acrimony. There will be wailing, kicking, and screaming. In the end, there will be cutbacks in promised payments.

The next two alternatives for a family were to earn more or to steal. The Federal Government doesn’t earn very much money. Forget that. Mostly it steals, that is, collects taxes. It’s good at stealing and the machinery is in place. It will be tempted to increase taxes while maintaining some of its promises, and it will probably succumb to this temptation. If it does, the downsizing that will occur will be in the income of taxpayers. They will feel pain, more pain than they currently feel. In addition, by raising taxes while maintaining its programs, there will be a bigger drag on the economy. Capital accumulation will decline and future income will decline because of that effect. So economic growth will also be downsized if taxes are raised to pay for government spending, other things equal.

Next, a family could borrow. If it did, it would have to pay it back with interest. That would cut into what it could spend later on. The retrenchment would be delayed or spread over the future. The same goes for the Feds. If they borrow in order to keep their promises, they’ll have to pay it back later. They can do that mainly through future taxes, which will have to be raised. That reduces the spendable income of Americans in the future. Borrowing is tantamount to raising taxes. Borrowing causes retrenchment in the income of Americans. Furthermore, whatever is spent on keeping the promises tends to be money not spent on things like capital accumulation. That’s another factor making for lower future income.

How much people can borrow depends on their ability to repay in the future. For the Feds, its ability depends on being able to collect taxes. That depends on the tax system, on the amount of income that can be taxed, and the politics of levying taxes. The U.S. government has relatively few problems mechanically collecting taxes. It’s already collecting taxes at high rates and raising them is likely to face political resistance. Yet the chances are that it can and will raise taxes. It can squeeze Americans more. Therefore, it will be able to borrow more. But it may face rising costs of borrowing as its capacity to tax runs up against limits, and it surely cannot borrow the huge amounts required to keep all its promises. Borrowing may rise, but it won’t get the Feds off the hook.

The government can do something a family cannot. It can counterfeit. It can print up green pieces of paper and spend them. It does this in a roundabout way by issuing debt. The lenders try to protect themselves against being paid back with depreciated pieces of paper by charging higher interest rates. Many others of us lack such protection. We suffer the effects of an unanticipated inflation. The complex inflation process acts like a tax, an inflation tax. Like any other tax and like government borrowing, it results in downsizing of the incomes of Americans. While this raises some money, it doesn’t raise all that much. This is a secondary source of funds. Inflation will continue, but it probably won’t be used as the main means to fund promises. That’s my guess, and others disagree. I believe that if too much inflation occurs, it defeats the Feds’ purposes because then interest rates on their debts rise steeply. This increases their cash outflows, which works opposite to what they want. This effect motivates them not to let inflation become too severe.

The next possible way to fund promises is by selling off assets. Few people talk about this, but this is where big money might be. The Federal Government has assets that it can sell. It owns a tremendous amount of land. But realistically it would have to sell off the land slowly over long periods of time and this would probably not solve its problem. Undeveloped land in remote locations doesn’t always bring in much money. Where there is really big money is in our assets, yours and mine. The Feds will work overtime trying to figure out ways to lay their hands on our asset holdings.

Immigration might be a way for the Federal Government to alleviate its cash flow discrepancy for a while. If enough new, young, and productive people settle in the U.S., they will generate taxes that could pay for some of the promises. However, if one does the math, this source of funds cannot pay for more than a small fraction of the promises. Later on, if the promises were maintained at current levels, this Ponzi scheme would collapse.

The Federal Government and the country will most likely muddle through with a combination of higher taxes, higher borrowing, cutbacks in promises, and greater inflation. If so, we will see income, promises, capital accumulation, and the value of the dollar all downsized.

There are better ways

There are better ways to downsize, ones that result in higher incomes for Americans. Higher incomes will result when rates of capital accumulation rise. This will happen when taxes and tax rates are lowered. But lowering taxes while keeping government spending and future promises at the same or rising levels is futile. That just means that borrowing has to be raised, which entails future taxes. The better path has to involve first and foremost lowering government spending and promises. These then enable tax cuts to occur without there being offsetting borrowing that nullifies the tax cuts.

To get rid of the ill effects of inflation, which are many and varied and also discourage capital accumulation and accumulation in appropriate forms, the monetary system of the U.S. needs to be completely and radically altered by eliminating the Federal Reserve System, fractional reserve banking, and the Federal Government’s role in money. The beneficial way to downsize is the downsizing of the government’s control over money, its money monopoly.

To unlock the potential for economic growth, the economy needs to be thoroughly and completely deregulated. The beneficial downsizing here is the elimination of the vast numbers of laws and regulations that affect almost every market under the sun, everything from trade restrictions to words printed on toys.

America will have to retrench in a few short years. Its only choice is how to retrench. If it downsizes government and government spending, including existing government promises, then incomes can rise. Every bit by which it downsizes government programs and promises contributes to income increases. They won’t have to be downsized if cutbacks in government occur. They will increase. In the limit, downsizing government to nothing, that is, removing its monopolies over a wide range of activities, can not only prevent the retrenchment in American incomes that lies directly ahead but lead to a revival of income growth at rates not seen in a hundred years.

If, on the other hand, America decides to keep its excessive promises, then it will be forced to fund them through higher taxes, higher borrowing and eventual taxes, and higher inflation. Incomes will stagnate and decline. Capital accumulation will suffer. Income growth will suffer. If America increases its excessive promises, such as by creating prescription drug benefits and by creating never-ending wars, then the retrenchments in incomes and income growth will be exacerbated even more.

Conclusion

Which path are we currently on? We are on the path of lower incomes and income growth. Congress and the Executive branches are irresponsible. Their irresponsibility reflects the greed and ignorance of American voters at large as well as a malfunctioning political system whose incentives are geared toward more and more spending and more and more promises.

The American State is on a path toward its demise. It should not be replaced by another such State. In my opinion, it shouldn’t be replaced by any State at all. And the worst thing that could happen would be for the country to turn to ever more centralization and dictatorship to solve the problems that lie ahead. It can happen here. It is far better to downsize the State than upsize it.

There now exists a growing and cogent body of thought about what went wrong with this State and why it went wrong. There exists a body of knowledge concerning the ideas of market anarchism and free markets. It suggests that it is impossible to create and keep a limited State and foolhardy to try. We have guidance on how to do better, which is end the State’s monopolies and thus end the State. Given the path we are on, we need to alter direction radically to get on a beneficial path. Continuing on as we are now, with business as usual, we will eventually have a chance to do better when the State collapses. It will take a great deal of many things such as luck, knowledge, initiative, will, and goodwill, to pull off a bloodless Second American Revolution that does not repeat the errors of the first. Let us pray that this can be done.

Some arguments are easy to understand, and others are easy to misunderstand. The kind of argument that is most difficult to understand properly is what goes by the name of a ""transcendental argument,"" a kind of logic check beneath the surface of everyday lines of reasoning. This kind of deduction is hard to assimilate because we often acquire knowledge through accretion, through collecting a pastiche of ad hockeries that serve as our knowledge bank. This knowledge-pastiche is hardly checked by us, except ""at the margin"" when either a falsity or a contradiction surfaces. A transcendental argument, on the other hand, impels us to take a systematic look at our thought processes, something that seems either odd or not very useful to do.

Objectivism’s ""fallacy of the stolen concept,"" defined as affirming a proposition while denying its logical antecedent, is one of these. Ostensibly an elaboration of contradicting a valid inference, it is confined to moving between levels of abstraction. An example of this fallacy would be ""All men are mortal, but Joe Fantastic will never die!"" Because this statement contains a subtle logic-oxymoron, we would normally metaphorize it, as we do with a regular oxymoron such as ""big small."" Something or someone called a ""big small,"" seriously, will prompt us to structure it as meaning, say, ""for a u2018small,’ it/he/she is pretty big,"" unless we reject the term out of hand as nonsensical. Thanks to our ability to think in two levels of abstraction, we can parse an oxymoron through identifying one term as a genus and the other as a differentium. For ""big small,"" I assumed that ""small"" was the genus and ""big"" was the differentium. Another kind of thinker, perhaps hailing from a different culture, might reverse that order, which would lead to the term being metaphorized as ""for a biggie, he/she/it isn’t much."" In the case of the statement about Joe Fantastic, the typical metaphorization, in our culture, is to assume that it means, ""Joe Fantastic will always be remembered by the living as if he were still alive.""

(As an aside, the standard Objectivist example of a proposition containing a stolen-concept fallacy, Proudhon’s ""all property is theft,"" is sensibly metaphorized as meaning ""all landed property in Europe, being acquired by conquest, thus has its origin in theft."" The justification for this interpretation is that Proudhon implicitly meant ""landed property"" when he wrote ""property."")

Another kind of transcendental argument is at the center of Hans-Herman Hoppe’s ultimate justification of the private property ethic (PDF file.) He concludes, after proving that argumentation logically presupposes self-ownership, that any denial of property rights is impugned by a ""performative contradiction,"" in which one’s actions contradict one’s case. This kernel of his epistemologic theory of metaethics is easy to misunderstand, because a performative contradiction isn’t easy to find a referent for, outside of pure thought.

There are examples of performative contradictions in the more quotidian world, though. The most obvious one is ""do as I say, not as I do."" Performative contradictions of this sort, though, are easy to justify, or to sensibly metaphorize, as ""you may as well learn from my mistakes instead of making your own,"" or ""I’ve, unfortunately, picked up bad habits throughout my life that I can’t shake off, but what I say to you is the result of learning from them. You might as well learn the easy way from me."" Note, though, that performative contradictions and authority tend to be associated with each other.

An even less intellectualized example of a performative contradiction can be found in bodybuilding. Bodybuilders are well acquainted with Nietzsche’s maxim ""what does not kill me, makes me stronger;"" it’s often translated to mean, ""no pain, no gain."" This statement identifies a cost-benefit relationship: in order to increase muscle mass, you have to tear your muscles up a little through exerting them, which often means suffering some pain while doing so. The pain is the cost of the gain in muscle mass. When interpreted this way, ""no pain, no gain"" means ""if you don’t pay the pain-cost, you get no bulking-benefit.""

Sometimes, though, that statement is interpreted to mean ""if you feel pain, you’re gaining. Thus, you should learn to see pain as a gain."" What makes the conclusion contain the seeds of a performative contradiction is the obvious function of pain: a warning signal of damage to the organism. Thus, a bodybuilder who claims that ""pain is good"" is ensnared in a performative contradiction, as will become evident when the pain that he (or she) experiences while working out becomes too much for him (or her) to stand.

This performative contradiction is, of course, metaphorized too. In modern culture, it tends to be interpreted as symptomatic of masochism. Cultures that are more oriented to physicality will metaphorize it differently, as meaning ""you have to increase your level of pain-tolerance."" Note, though, that performative contradictions involving pain do impress, sometimes mightily, as evidenced by Jim Morrison, in the movie The Doors, belting out the line ""my old friend pain"" when mad at his wife. In fact, living in a performative contradiction does convey a lot of prestige if doing so requires a lot of effort or willpower.

Thus, it should be of little surprise that the State and performative contradictions often nestle together. Government officials do not like being criticized, because criticism diminishes their authority. An impressive performative contradiction does tend to staunch logical thought, because metaphorization replaces reasoning, thus making critical thought more difficult and more ad hockish. The latter degradation makes it even harder to reason critically, and subtly circumscribes the range of critical thought.

It is possible to reach certain truths while laboring under a set of contradictory premises. An example of such would be the belief that all four arithmetical operations are commutative, with respect to both input numbers but not with respect to the output number. Since the output number for an addition and multiplication operation is, in fact, one of the input numbers for the corresponding subtraction or division operation, this belief contradicts itself.

Someone who believes it, though, and has the normal human habit of checking premises ""at the margin,"" could get through life without ever realizing its contradictoriness — if that person never subtracts or divides, but only adds and multiplies. This example illustrates that it is possible to use a set of contradictory premises for gaining and using limited knowledge, without being aware of the limits therein. Thus, contradictory premises do not extinguish thought, but they do subtly limit thought, in ways unbeknownst to the holders of such premises. Since thought and mental effort are economized, these limits are often taken in stride as yet another example of ""limited CPU power.""

Accepted performative contradictions also self-limit thought. A person making an argument for universal enslavement can spin out a case through the avoidance of hypocrisy. (""Yes, I’d be a slave too."") It wouldn’t be long, though, before the performative contradiction would surface, thus necessitating recourse to some dogma, or to fallacies such as positing the determinist doctrine.

Interestingly enough, a wider thought-latitude exists in arguments for partial slavery, through positing categorical differences between human beings. ""Some people are rulers, others are of the ruled, a third category of people is the misfits or the deviants, and this triple classification will always be true for any group of people."" This template is the general framework for all justifications of statism. The conclusion of Professor Hoppe, though, enables any evaluator of them to see hidden flaws, non sequiturs and buried limits, ones unbeknownst to their propounders, in any of them.

The Thirteenth

Amendment of the Constitution, adopted at the end of the civil War

in 1865, abolished slavery, but this same amendment expressly permits

prison slavery and involuntary servitude.

AMENDMENT

XIII — SECTION 1

Neither slavery

nor involuntary servitude, except as punishment for crime whereof

the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the

United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.

The United

States has less than 5 percent of the world's population and almost

25 percent of the world's prisoners. Are Americans more criminal

than other folks? Or are there incentives that give the US the dubious

honor of leading the world in prison population.

Prison labor

has its roots in slavery. After the 18611865 Civil War a system

of “hiring out prisoners” was introduced in order to continue the

slavery tradition. Freed slaves were charged with not carrying out

their sharecropping commitments (cultivating someone else's land

in exchange for part of the harvest) or petty thievery — which were

almost never proven — and were then “hired out” for cotton picking,

working in mines and building railroads.

The tradition

continues. The nation needs a way to fill the prisons which provide

a source of cheap labor. Surely the criminal justice system can

be of help here, and indeed they are. Gerry Spence, the famed criminal

lawyer, in his book From

Freedom To Slavery, tells us: “I found that the minions

of the law — the special agents of the FBI — to be men who proved

themselves not only fully capable, but also utterly willing to manufacture

evidence, to conceal crucial evidence and even to change the rules

that governed life and death if, in the prosecution of the accused,

it seemed expedient to do so.”

Well surely

the court judges are concerned with justice? Spence: “We are told

that our judges, charged with constitutional obligations, insure

equal justice for all. That, too, is a myth. The function of the

law is not to provide justice or to preserve freedom. The function

of the law is to keep those who hold power, in power.”

Now the law

enforcement authorities don’t do this all by themselves. For one

thing, they have onerous laws to help them. It is instructive to

look at the state of California in this regard.

The California

Prison system is the third largest penal system in the country,

costing $$5.7 billion dollars a year and housing over 170,000 inmates.

Since 1980 the number of California prisons has tripled and the

number of inmates has jumped significantly. In the past few years

controversies involving prison expansion, sky-rocketing costs, and

claims of mismanagement and inmate abuse have put the California

prison system under heightened public scrutiny.

What caused

prisons to be a growth industry in California? Did Californians

suddenly become lawless? We need look no further than the CCPOA,

the California Correctional Peace Officers Association. ""The

Power this prison guards' union wields inside our prisons, legislative

chambers and governor’s office disturbs me. It should disturb every

citizen."" ~ Judith Tannenbaum, formerly an English teacher

at San Quentin State Prison

The CCPOA is

the biggest contributor to political campaigns in California. The

CCPOA gives twice as much in political contributions as the California

Teachers Association, yet it is one-tenth its size. In 1998, the

CCPOA gave over $$2 million to Governor Gray Davis, $$763,000 to the

media, and over $$100,000 to Proposition 184, the 3 Strikes law.

The 3 Strikes law mandated that convicted felons with one prior

felony got twice the normal sentence for their 2nd strike, and convicted

felons with two or more prior felonies would get at least 3 times

the normal sentence or 25 years (whichever is more) for their 3rd

strike. The CCCPOA has a vested interest in locking up more and

more Californians for longer sentences.

The California

prison guards union has grown from a fledgling group of fewer than

2500 members in 1978 to a powerhouse of 31,000 members who contribute

$$21.9 million dollars a year. The union employs a 91 person staff

including 20 full-time attorneys and uses the services of five lobbyists

and a team of public relations consultants, housed in the 62,000

square foot CCPOA headquarters. The state hiring office for prison

guards brags that the job has been called the greatest entry-level

job in California — and for good reason. “Along with the great salary,”

one of their ads notes, ""our peace officers earn a retirement

package you just can't find in private industry.""

California

prisons are managed by an agency with 60,000 employees, including

the 30,000 in the prison guards’ union. California’s fourth prison

chief in a row, Jim Tilton, is leaving earlier than planned from

a meat-grinder of a job reputed to be among the toughest in state

government. So what makes the incoming Matt Cate think he can depart

on his own terms? “This mission is where my heart is,” said Cate,

named by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to the $$225,000-a-year job running

the state’s massively challenged prison agency. “Public safety has

been my career because I care about it.”

Currently California

is in a fiscal crisis, so Governor Schwarzenegger is proposing the

early release of some 22,000 inmates and eliminating about 4,500

prison guard positions to help shave $$400 million from the budget

of the state corrections department. The guards’ union is unhappy

with that scenario, and has allied with victims’ associations to

fight it. Meanwhile overcrowding in state prisons results in violence.

A stabbing attack on four guards at one overcrowded state prison

and a racially sparked brawl at another mark the type of violence

that guards, inmates’ attorneys and Schwarzenegger have been worried

about for years.

What to do

with all these prisoners? A US prison population of over 2 million

people — mostly Black and Hispanic — are working for various industries

for a pittance. For the tycoons who have invested in the prison

industry, it has been like finding a pot of gold. They don't have

to worry about strikes or paying unemployment insurance, vacations

or comp time. All of their workers are full-time, and never arrive

late or are absent because of family problems; moreover, if they

don't like the pay of 25 cents an hour and refuse to work, they

are locked up in isolation cells.

Private companies,

now numbering 135, began using prison labor in the 1970s. Microsoft,

McDonalds, TWA, IBM, Victoria's Secret, AT&T and Toys R Us are

just some of the companies that use prisoners to cheaply produce

products or provide services. While the rate of pay may vary from

state to state, the constant is that the great majority of the money

that the companies pay goes to the state in which the prisoners

are incarcerated.

For instance,

in California prisoners receive the ""minimum wage"" on

paper, but the state takes 80 percent for state restitution, anti-drug

campaigns, victim's rights organizations and a prisoner ""trust

fund.""

The state of

Colorado employs prison labor for everything from agriculture, which

includes running a fishery, dairy farm and harvesting grapes, to

making furniture and firefighting. Colorado legislators recently

passed some of the most restrictive immigration laws in the country

following a massive mobilization for immigrant rights. The new laws

scared away workers, causing many crops to spoil in the fields for

lack of farm workers. The Colorado farm owners' answer to this crisis

is to find labor even more exploitable than immigrant workers —

prison labor ""chain gangs."" And the need for more prisoners

is thereby increased even more.

The prison

industry complex is one of the fastest-growing industries in the

United States and its investors are on Wall Street. This multimillion-dollar

industry has its own trade exhibitions, conventions, websites, and

mail-order/Internet catalogs. It also has direct advertising campaigns,

architecture companies, construction companies, investment houses

on Wall Street, plumbing supply companies, food supply companies,

armed security, and padded cells in designer colors.

The federal

prison industry produces 100% of all military helmets, ammunition

belts, bullet-proof vests, ID tags, shirts, pants, tents, bags,

and canteens. Along with war supplies, prison workers supply 98%

of the entire market for equipment assembly services; 93% of paints

and paintbrushes; 92% of stove assembly; 46% of body armor; 36%

of home appliances; 30% of headphones/microphones/speakers; and

21% of office furniture. Airplane parts, medical supplies, and much

more: prisoners are even raising seeing-eye dogs for blind people.

It might be

a good idea to get away from these public union-driven prisons.

How about private prisons? The number of prisoners in private prisons

grew more than 3,000 percent between 1987 and 2004, soaring from

3,122 to 98,700.

Two companies

dominate the for-profit incarceration industry — Corrections Corporation

of America (CCA) and the GEO Group, formerly known as Wackenhut

Corrections. These two companies control 75 percent of the for-profit

incarceration market. The highest-paying private prison is CCA in

Tennessee, where prisoners receive 50 cents per hour for what they

call “highly skilled positions.”

The problem

with prison privatization is that Corporate-owned prisons need a

steady flow of inmates to maintain profits. To protect their profit

margins, prison companies exert political influence by contributing

thousands of dollars to state political campaigns. Lobbyists for

private prisons support tough-on-crime legislation that ensures

the continued need for prison space, including mandatory minimum

sentences, life terms for ""three strikes,"" and sentencing

juveniles as adults.

We’re back

where we started, with the private corporations doing what the California

union is doing — promoting the supply of more inmates in more prisons

with longer sentences.

So there we

have it. America, with one-quarter the population of China, has

500,000 more prisoners than China and many of them are hard at work.

US citizens are placed in long-term involuntary servitude with the

help of law enforcement and onerous laws pushed by a prison workers

union and private prison corporations, and it’s all constitutional.

373130,"If liberty is the natural orientation of mankind, then we can trust that our children and grandchildren will turn to that light, seek the warmth of freedom, and always resent their chains.

I hope our children will innately remember liberty, and somehow understand that it is indeed their birthright.

There are three things we might be able to do now to help the upcoming generations. The republic has already fallen, as thousands of pages of laws have replaced fundamental rule of law, and every citizen today is no more than a felon in waiting. A new American culture of dependency on the state has replaced healthier cultures of personal independence and market productivity.

The past eras, when both rich and poor boldly rejected European and third world statism and took a one-way trip to America, are long gone. They will not return. Today, no more geographic new worlds exist for those who value freedom more than security, or risk-taking and creativity over fascistic centralized control. The task at hand is to recreate republics outside of top-heavy militarized socialism, underneath the ahistorical and moronic state media, and above state educational systems.

We and our children have one overarching mission today. We must ride out the failure and ragged collapse of national and global socialism with our lives and souls intact, and with the skills and vision to rebuild a better system of trade and governance, one that is liberty-oriented, decentralized, and inexpensive.

We have some of the tools we need already — we are human and love freedom. In some ways we are addicted to liberty — when we have a little, we envision more, we accomplish and produce more, and we want more freedom to do so. Freedom is dangerous to the state. With neither force or fear, freedom motivates and rewards every human action in a single moment. Freedom produces value, and it creates its own demand.

First and foremost, we ought to create in our children and grandchildren a taste for freedom.

For the past thirty years, the emphasis in public schools and in society has been to foster the development of ""self-esteem"" in young people. This has been and continues to be done by avoiding hard knocks and adventure, discouraging strongly held opinions, replacing logical judgment with authoritarian mandates, and promoting groupthink. The self-esteem movement is part and parcel of a broader strategy of feminization in public education. Feminization of public schooling de-emphasizes the role of individualism and liberty in creating and fostering peaceful productive communities, while creating habitual followers. This was not done by hiring women in the school system, but rather by systemic and pharmaceutical promotion of ""feminine"" qualities of submission, obedience, cooperation, compromise, and avoidance of passion that are considered culturally acceptable feminine qualities. Students (many of our own sons and grandsons, as well as daughters and granddaughters) failing to sufficiently demonstrate these qualities are punished, held back, medicated and even incarcerated.

The feminization of the public school and university system creates exactly what the state needs — a marriage of a feminized population with the masculine state. But thirty years of public school feminization was predated by what the welfare and entitlement system has done to American families. Senator Patrick Moynihan complained nearly 50 years ago, in 1965, that the welfare system was already having the measureable effect of replaced human husbands with the husbandry of the state. The state would be pronounced breadwinner, rulemaker, and guarantor of safety and survival, till death.

To state as ""father"" and state as ""husband,"" add in state as ""mother."" This has been subtly achieved through the friendly and cooperative yoking of media and the state that began before World War II. Americans today have consumed nearly 70 years of streaming state propaganda that encourages us to believe and accept that unrepublican and unconstitutional government in Washington, D.C. is in fact both republican and constitutional. With rare exceptions, we have been told that the warfare-welfare state is not an empire, but instead a shining city on a hill that the rest of the world envies and admires.

When I reflect on what socialism in American has wrought — I worry less about the next four years of Obama and more about the last 75 years of American statism's unarguable success in shaping the bulk of the population into passive, weak, unimaginative slaves and serfs.

Yet — for this unending diet of socialistic illusion a percentage of Americans have remained awake, and many more are awakening today to the fundamental realities that socialism isn't free, and that our government lies, cheats, and steals as a matter of policy.

The abundant and rapidly growing home school movement has been one response to the counter-logical and anti-liberty message of the state to our children. Today, over 5.5 million young people are in private schools, and another 1.5 million are homeschooled. Beyond that is adult self-education being pursued by tens of millions as a result of the Internet. Ironically, this self education is aided by the state fostered underemployment that has created a troika of frustration, curiosity, and time to pursue interesting ideas from people all over the world and from past generations. I would suggest that we have more Rothbardians today than when the great man was alive, and we probably have more Randians today than when Ayn held court. I wonder if we also don't have fewer true Marxists than when Marx and Lenin were alive — because the Internet and modern events have put forth the failed record of Marxism for all to see. Certainly, countries that suffered lost decades and generations under Communism and subsequently transitioned to something slightly more market based and libertarian are not filled with Marxists any more, if they ever were.

This is cause alone for hope — statist systems collapse but people don't. Our children — and ourselves — should aspire to be not just survivors but rainmakers and change agents. This means we must, as soon as practical, divorce the state as husband, reject the state as mother, and abandon the state as father. We do all of this much as we would divorce a real husband, reject a real mother, or abandon a real father. Prepare, consider strengths and options, and then leave the state family to go out into the world and test ourselves, produce for ourselves, and take on for ourselves those wonderful qualities of father, mother, and husband. This means we exercise courage, work hard, learn rapidly, and become more alert and aware of both past and present, and more willing to boldly look over the horizon to an unpredictable future.

This is what the state currently attempts to do for us. It is ""courageous"" so we don't have to be. It works, as Obama has said, and it builds our businesses. It learns while dumbing us down, and it looks to the future and plans our role in that future. Today, as the political mouthpieces have been saying, the state is taking us over a cliff, at full speed ahead.

We must give ourselves and our children an awareness and understanding of real freedom, and real independence. We must divorce the state, as individuals and as extended families. To survive, we and our children must be prepared to jump off the speeding train, leap out of the back seat of that car being driven over the cliff by Red Thelma and Blue Louise.

Beyond fostering a sense of freedom's possibilities and demands, we must prepare physically and economically for the collapse of the state-led family — and that means, much as the collapse of any family, uncertainty, doubt, economic hardship, new kinds of jobs and even relocating. We would do well to revisit George Carlin's famous ""stuff"" skit. The stuff we have ought to be useful for the next phase — meaning an era of independence, creativity and survival, self-education, production and provision of what we and others people need, and NOT what the state needs.

The state needs your payroll income, it needs you driving to and from state-approved activities, and it needs centralized control. Divorced from the state, and post-state, we ought to examine what it is that people and communities really need. I would submit that centralized control, payroll income, and state approved activities are going to be low on the list of what we will be needing — so think on these things and start practicing now. Help our children differentiate between community and market self-perpetuating order and the heavy-handed controls of the state that poses as ""order.""

If we help our children and those around us to understand freedom, seek it, if we take steps to divorce the state's many assumed roles in our lives, and if we prepare physically and educationally for living and producing above, below and beyond state awareness and control, we have done much. Unplugging from the state can be done, slowly and bit by bit, while we have the chance and the choice. Unplugging may also give us more time to think, to learn, to study to practice new skills and most importantly, to strengthen our relationships with people. Our networks and extended families, and our like-minded communities will be critical in surviving and thriving the metastasizing cancer of present-day American fascism. They will be imperative if we intend to thrive in the coming post-socialism era.

We crave and need liberty, and liberty is our God-given birthright. We must divorce the state, unplug from socialism, and prepare for the collapse that always occurs when debt and poverty collapse a government semblance of order. Humans are strongest and healthiest with a combination of active intellectual growth and hard physical work. My advice for my children is to embrace both with equal enthusiasm.

In the view of our Laputan foreign-policy establishment, what is happening in Syria and elsewhere is a conflict between democracy and dictatorship. Valiant youths who fight for freedom are destined to triumph, bringing happiness and prosperity to their formerly oppressed lands. This is the Whig version of history  the progressive narrative. It bears little resemblance to reality.

A Syrian Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi came closer to truth. He was quoted in the New York Times as saying that Syria faces gang warfare.

Gangs are one of the most basic, and most potent, building blocks of stateless Fourth Generation war. We commonly think of gangs in connection with crime. But through most of history, the line between crime and war was blurred, often to the point of vanishing. (See Barbara Tuchmans A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous Fourteenth Century.)

It was the state that drew the line clearly, but today in much of the Middle East and elsewhere states and the state system are collapsing. What is succeeding the state looks much like the 14th century Europe Tuchman describes: people and regions are at the mercy of roving bands of armed men who hire themselves out as soldiers when they can and otherwise take what they want from anyone too weak to resist them. Their only loyalty is to each other  to their gang.

One of the characteristics shared by most disintegrating states is a vast surplus of young men who have no access to jobs, money, or women. Gangs are a magnet for them. We see this in American contexts as well: in public schools, in ethnic neighborhoods, and in our prisons, most of which are controlled not by wardens but by racially defined gangs.

Young men are also drawn to fighting, which, conveniently, is something gangs do. Much of what we see in states struggling for their lives such as Syria is supply-side war. Fighting spreads not because of some cause like democracy but because idle young men see a fight and join in. Why not? They have nothing to do, nothing to lose, and thanks to their new gang and AK-47, lots to take: money, women, and fame. The New York Times reported from Aleppo:

Residents said there were not just clashes between the government and insurgents, but also rival militias from the countryside fighting for control of individual streets. In a central old quarter, one man said a friend had warned him not to visit because young gunmen had established a checkpoint to rob car passengers.

506716,"The American Empire is scheduled to depart from Iraq in June. The unofficial word is out in Washington: Karl Rove has told President Bush that the body count, however much reduced by strange definitions of what constitutes a battlefield death, is going to cost him the election if it continues through the summer. Dutifully, the Commander-in-Chief has announced a June deadline for the transfer of Iraq’s sovereignty to “the Iraqis,” meaning whichever remnants of the coalition of the suppressed will still officially deal with him on his terms.

If you want a mental image of what is taking place in the White House today, picture Dorothy and her three companions walking through the forest of Oz. They are chanting, over and over, “Shi’ites and Sunnis and Kurds.”

The United States government started a pre-emptory war last year. Patriotic couch potatoes marveled at televised shock and awe: flash, boom, smoke. “Wow! Neat! Cool!” President Bush, Sr., said in 1991, “This shall not stand.” That is what his son said about the Baghdad skyline. But Americans are now being asked to pick up the pieces, or at least to pay Halliburton to pick up the pieces. Karl Rove has heard the rumblings. The departure date is now set.

Of course, all of the troops will not depart. Reserves are being called up to serve as car-bomb fodder. But, officially, the United States will become an invited observer, probably sharing authority with the United Nations. (This assumes — safely — that no elections will be held prior to June 30; otherwise, the United States will be asked to leave on July 1.). That will please liberals, who will chant, “Bush should have done it this way from the beginning.” Meanwhile, conservatives will conveniently overlook the fact that (1) the U.S. military is in retreat mode and (2) the Administration had to beg the United Nations Organization to come to Iraq and bail out Mr. Bush politically. Rush Limbaugh will not remind his listeners of this embarrassing fact. He will not sing the praises of “those courageous and dedicated representatives of the United Nations, the world’s legitimizer of last resort.” He will, instead, do his Winston Smith imitation, for which he is deservedly famous.

Americans thoroughly enjoy seeing American troops bang heads around the world, but only on these assumptions: (1) the victims can’t or won’t fight back; (2) the military’s adventures do not visibly tap into Americans’ pocketbooks; (3) our troops can pull out at any time without visibly putting their tails between their legs. When there are helicopter retreats from Saigon, American voters react in a hostile fashion. Americans like war, but they like it cheap.

The war in Iraq has been costly in every sense, yet Americans still are paying higher prices at the gasoline pump. The price of oil has risen. The flow of oil out of Iraq today barely trickles. The pipelines cannot be defended by our troops. They are being blown up, although the media rarely report this. The Iraq adventure has now become a vast foreign aid program, and Americans do not like foreign aid programs. The do not like to share the wealth. They want to get their hands on the wealth confiscated politically from their neighbors. They resent foreign interlopers who tap into the flow of stolen goods.

When the regular troops pull out, news from Iraq will peter out, just as Iraqi oil has. There will be stories of this or that car bombing, this or that assassination, this or that break-off tribe. But Iraq will become Afghanistan in the perception of most Americans: out of sight, out of mind. If you want it packaged in a convenient slogan, however incorrect politically, I suggest this one: “When wogs are killing only wogs, the West loses interest.”

This will mark the reversal of the American empire. It has taken a long time.

“WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION”

George W. Bush invoked weapons of mass destruction, just as Lyndon Johnson invoked the Gulf of Tonkin incident. It was never quite clear exactly what had happened in the Gulf of Tonkin, but it is clear that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Johnson was never successfully exposed publicly as a liar regarding the Gulf of Tonkin. Bush has been exposed, and will continue to be exposed, as either completely misled or a liar, either a nincompoop or a deceiver. He is never going to get back his image as a reliable leader in a time of war, which is the only positive image he ever enjoyed, brief as it was. He will be on the defensive from now on. The phrase, “weapons of mass destruction,” will be pinned on his backside the same way “trust me” was pinned on Carter, “read my lips: no new taxes” was pinned on Bush’s father, and “I feel your pain” was pinned on Clinton, barely leaving enough room for “I did not have sex with that woman.”

It will become extremely difficult from now on for any American President to invoke a looming military threat in order to justify military intervention by the United States. Clearly, President Bush will never be able to do this again, but I think it goes beyond him. His enduring legacy will be the conversion of “weapons of mass destruction” into the equivalent of Neville Chamberlain’s “peace in our time.” The phrase will become a laughingstock. Every President from now on who attempts to justify anything comparable to the Iraq war will be greeted with Congressional hoots of “weapons of mass destruction.” Any Congressman with an eye to being re-elected (but I repeat myself) will remember seeing John Kerry’s verbal tap-dancing around his support of launching a war against Iraq. No Congressman wants to be sucked into a retroactive quagmire.

Iraq is a sandy quagmire, just as the war’s critics predicted it would be. It is Vietnam without a comparable body count. It is a continuing disaster, and as soon as the troops leave, Rush Limbaugh will cease trying to defend the disaster. When the troops depart, the Republican faithful will become afflicted with what I call Rushheimer’s disease: selective amnesia. Saddam Hussein will get a trial, but media coverage will match the coverage given to Slobodan Milosevic’s trial.

The war was a bipartisan effort, but because of the President’s rhetoric, he will deservedly get blamed. The Democrats will not push too hard, however, because voters might make the connection between the President’s unsubstantiated claims and Congress’s willingness to roll over and play dead, or whatever it was playing when it rolled over. (“Will you still respect me in the morning?” “Sure I will, baby.”) The next time a President calls for an invasion, Congress will be far less supine.

LOSING THE WAR

Our troops won a minor battle in March, 2003. That battle was called a war, but it was only one battle in a very long war. This war has been going on for about 14 centuries. The war’s main theater today is the Middle East. When it becomes apparent to America’s enemies, which are also the State of Israel’s enemies, that the United States did not win its phase of the ancient war, they will be emboldened. Winning the battle in the Middle East requires permanent military occupation by the victors. American voters will not pay the price required. When it comes to wars, American voters are great believers in hit and run. For them, a war is a one-night stand. They prefer to get on with business. Americans want a commercial empire, not a military empire. They view a military empire as justified only because it promotes business. Iraq is not promoting business.

Americans have no intention of becoming surrogate Israelis. The State of Israel is now permanently on the defensive. When Israeli troops fled from Lebanon — “fled” is the correct word to describe their literally overnight departure — it was clear who is winning the war.

This war is deeply religious. This makes it a demographic war. Israelis are losing this war in the bedroom. It is only a matter of time, which is why they are building the wall: a very large prophylactic to deal with the effects of smaller prophylactics. But the comparative birth rates inside the wall’s confines tell the story. The Arabs are winning. They know it. Only if the government imposes a new diaspora and forces all Arabs outside the wall can the Israelis even pretend to be winning. This would be a policy of democracy by removal — what the Afrikaners were unwilling to attempt. In gentile countries, this process is called ethnic cleansing. It is very popular in areas where Muslims and Christians seek territorial hegemony.

In Europe the same war is in progress. Muslims are winning it in the same place: the bedroom. If the trend continues — and there is little evidence that it won’t — the result is inevitable. Christian Europe, which is in fact secular Europe, is going to be replaced. Tours and Lepanto will prove to have been minor skirmishes in a very long war. I can think of only one event that might reverse this process. No one ever mentions it in polite company. It is officially unthinkable. Yet it is being thought in high places. It could take place within 30 minutes from now. It would change everything geopolitically. The Israelis could launch a pre-emptory nuclear strike against Mecca and Medina. The primary symbols of Islam would be reduced to radioactive dust. If the Israelis used a cobalt-tipped bomb, Muslims could not visit Mecca for millennia. Yet Muslims are told to do so at least once in a lifetime.

This tactic is Israel’s trump card strategically. Everyone in power in the Middle East knows it, but no one ever mentions it publicly. Muslims venerate Mecca and Medina and their monuments. When veneration becomes superstition, monuments become primary military targets for the enemy. If the Jews blast Mecca’s rock into radioactive dust, the fallout will be more than radioactive dust. It could be the end of Islam.

Do I think this attack will ever happen? Yes. The Israelis know they are in a fight to the death. They know they will never be accepted by Arabs as lawful residents in the region. Over time, they will be overcome demographically. They know it. Their enemies know it. So, when push comes to shove, Mecca and Medina will disappear.

The United States government is not about to play this trump card. So, the United States is going to lose the war in the Middle East. If you hold back in the Middle East, you are perceived as a loser. The United States has no ace in the hole. Voters here are impatient.

President Bush used to talk tough. Rumsfeld talked about a war lasting for decades. But the Bush Administration will not last for decades. It may not last another twelve months. This is why all the tough talk has ended. The war that matters here is politics, and Iraq has become a political liability. We see and hear little from Rumsfeld these days. Rove appears to have put a gag on him.

The neo-cons are finished. They said the Iraq war would be a cakewalk. It wasn’t. They said we had to establish a presence in the Middle East. We couldn’t. The Republican Party, once Bush leaves office, will not listen to them again. They will publish their subsidized magazines and pretend that the public is listening, but the public has had enough. The neo-cons are visibly losers. They got their shot at power, and they squandered it in the streets of Baghdad. Straussians do not need to read between the lines in order to discern this traditional message: “Americans do not listen to losers.”

Bobos in paradise are uninterested in the Middle East. Trust me.

CONCLUSION

The contraction of the American empire will begin in June. It has already lost considerable legitimacy in the eyes of the voters, not because of some great alteration of their principles, but because we are being car-bombed out of the place. The oil is not flowing. Sand isn’t worth the price.

This will be an historic event. Historians will be able to establish a date on which to hang their narratives. Historians will do anything to find such a dated event. December 7, 1941 marks the beginning of the empire in the textbooks, although the Spanish-American War was the more obvious birthplace, assuming that the Louisiana Purchase wasn’t — a major assumption. But Pearl Harbor gets all the attention because of the unarguable transformation of American foreign policy that it produced. Sporadic intervention prior to Pearl Harbor became permanent intervention after.

The troops’ departure from Iraq will mark the day that Johnny comes marching home. There will be no parades, any more than there were when Israeli troops pulled out of Lebanon.

The implosion of the American empire is about to begin — not just the military one but also the commercial one. An empire that can no longer afford to keep its troops on active duty in occupied areas is not a good credit risk.

Mark the date on your calendar: June 30, 2004.

218659,"I spent last week in Pittsfield, Maine, at a symposium on modern war called by Colonel Mike Wyly, USMC retired. Col. Wyly was one of the heroes of the maneuver warfare movement in the Marine Corps in the 1970s and 80s, and when he suggests it’s time for a new effort, people listen. My hope was that we might make some progress on Fourth Generation war theory, and while I am not sure we accomplished that, we did gain some ground on one important question: what might a state armed service designed for 4GW look like?

To address that question, we first had to answer another one: what would such a force’s mission be? Not being neo-Trotskyites, we derived our answer within the framework of a defensive grand strategy. The new service’s (and it should be a new armed service) primary mission would be to prevent outbreaks of Fourth Generation war on American soil. The focus must be on prevention, not ""first response,"" because if we are forced into a response mode the enemy has already won. And, the new service must be oriented not only to preventing imported 4GW, like that we saw on 9/11, but also the home-grown variety such as London just experienced.

But — and here was the kicker — the new service has to keep us safe without pushing America further toward Big Brother, the all-powerful, centralized, national security state represented by the Department of Homeland Security, the ""Patriot Act"" and much else coming out of Washington.

So what should this new 4GW armed service be? The answer of our working group at the symposium was, ""a militia.""

The militia was the basis of America’s defense through most of our history as a republic. More, there are two contemporary models. One is volunteer fire departments, which small town and rural America depend on and which almost always perform well. The other is community policing, where cops walk the same beat in the same neighborhood for a long time, long enough to understand the neighborhood and prevent crimes instead of just responding to them. Neither volunteer fire departments nor community police serve as control mechanisms for the federal government. They respond to their local communities, not to Washington.

The new militia’s most important function would be neighborhood watch. The only way to prevent 4GW attacks is to find out about them before they happen, and that means the militia, like community police, must know what is happening in their neighborhoods. But again, we don’t want to feed Big Brother. Almost all of what the militia knows should remain on the local level.

How can we make this happen? Our working group decided the militia should normally report to the county sheriff, a local, elected official who has a lot of independence. Sheriffs’ powers, defined over centuries in common law, allow them to tell the feds to stick it. Nor are they under the thumb of local or state politicians. If they violate citizens’ rights, they can be unelected real fast. The militia, we also decided, would not have powers of arrest unless deputized. A separation of powers between the militia and law enforcement would also help maintain citizens’ rights.

Another danger we wanted to avoid was allowing the First Generation culture of order, still characteristic of America’s Second Generation armed forces, to carry over to the new service. Like Third Generation militaries, the militia must be outward focused, prize initiative over obedience and depend on self-discipline, not imposed discipline. We therefore determined that there should be very little in the way of formal ranks or commands and no saluting, drill, uniforms (at least none required) etc. The largest unit would be the company, with an elected captain. The captain’s duties would be mostly administrative, and sub-units could elect adjutants to handle their paperwork if they wanted to. The militiamen would be free to choose leaders on a task basis, picking whoever they thought was best qualified depending on what they had to do. Yes, this means trusting ordinary citizens to show some common sense. Republics do that; if they can’t or won’t, they are no longer republics.

Another characteristic of our anti-4GW militia is that unless mobilized, the militiamen would not be paid. Instead of pay, they would collect points toward retirement benefits and — we thought this could kill two birds with one stone — they would receive health insurance for themselves and their families. Instead of health coverage just becoming another ""entitlement,"" citizens who did something for their country would find their country doing something for them. We thought long-term benefits like pensions and health insurance would also help recruit the kind of people the militia needs, solid citizens capable of delayed gratification.

Next week’s column will continue this report on the results of Colonel Wyly’s symposium, including the militia. And no, the fact that we met in Maine did not lead us to consider using moose as crew-served weapons carriers.

460447,"Recently by Ron Paul: Economy Squeezed as Debt Accelerates

Listen to Ron Paul

It is ironic but perhaps sadly appropriate that Attorney General Eric Holder would choose a law school, Northwestern University, to deliver a speech earlier this month in which he demolished what was left of the rule of law in America.

In what history likely will record as a turning point, Attorney General Holder bluntly explained that this administration believes it has the authority to use lethal force against Americans if the President determines them to be a threat to the nation. He tells us that this is not a violation of the due process requirements of our Constitution because the President himself embodies ""due process"" as he unilaterally determines who is to be targeted. As Holder said, ""a careful and thorough executive branch review of the facts in a case amounts to ‘due process.’"" That means that the administration believes it is the President himself who is to be the judge, jury, and executioner.

As George Washington University Law Professor Jonathan Turley wrote of the Holder speech:

""All the Administration has said is that they closely and faithfully follow their own guidelines  even if their decisions are not subject to judicial review. The fact that they say those guidelines are based on notions of due process is meaningless. They are not a constitutional process of review.""

It is particularly bizarre to hear the logic of the administration claiming the right to target its citizens according to some secret selection process, when we justified our attacks against Iraq and Libya because their leaders supposedly were targeting their own citizens! We also now plan a covert war against Syria for the same reason.

I should make it perfectly clear that I believe any individual who is engaging in violence against this country or its citizens should be brought to justice. But as Attorney General Holder himself points out in the same speech, our civilian courts have a very good track record of trying and convicting individuals involved with terrorism against the United States. Our civilian court system, with the guarantee of real due process, judicial review, and a fair trial, is our strength, not a weakness. It is not an impediment to be sidestepped in the push for convictions or assassinations, but rather a process that guarantees that fundamental right to be considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.

I am encouraged, however that there appears to be the beginning of a backlash against the administration’s authoritarian claims. Just recently I did an interview with conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham who expressed grave concern over using these sorts of tactics against Americans using the supposed war on terror as justification. Sadly, many conservative leaders were silent when Republican President George W. Bush laid the groundwork for this administration’s lawlessness with the PATRIOT Act, warrantless wiretapping, indefinite detention without trial, and other violations. Similarly, as Professor Turley points out, ""Democrats previously demanded the ‘torture memos’ of the Bush administration that revealed poor legal analysis by Judge Jay Bybee and Professor John Yoo to justify torture. Now, however, Democrats are largely silent in the face of a president claiming the right to unilaterally kill citizens."" The misuse of and disregard for our Constitution for partisan political gain is likely one reason the American public holds Congress in such low esteem. Now the stakes are much higher. Congress and the people should finally wake up!

170267,"Universities haven’t changed much since the Middle Ages. There is the campus with its lecture halls, dormitories, libraries, and laboratories surrounded by leafy quadrangles. Well, they’ve added giant sports complexes, gyms and swimming pools, and gourmet restaurants, but the basic layout is the same. And the production process hasn’t changed since around 1200. Professors give lectures, students read books and take notes, there are examinations and grades, along with the occasional tutoring session, and a great deal of hanky panky. The professors wear tweed jackets instead of gowns, and the students wear – well, just about anything, including pajamas – but otherwise the university remains one of society’s most conservative institutions.

This has all been challenged, quite radically, in the last decade, as students, parents, taxpayers, and donors have begun to grasp the potential of the internet for revolutionizing the education industry. Distance-learning has been around for a long time (what used to be called “correspondence courses”), but the internet has made it possible for people to educate themselves, independently or in groups large and small, on an unprecedented scale. Startup companies, sometimes unaccredited, are entering the education space as never before. Alternative providers and platforms such as Khan Academy, TED, and the Mises Academy are offering modular, flexible, and specialized alternatives to the medieval model that continues to dominate the establishment universities. And everyone is talking about MOOCs, “Massively Online Open Courses,” offered by standalone firms or in partnerships with established universities.

The early — and predictable — reaction of the traditional universities was to denounce the entrants as cheap, inferior, fly-by-night operations. “They don’t offer real degrees!” “They don’t provide a high-quality education like we do!” Actually, some of the startups offer extremely high-quality products. Others don’t, but so what? Why should “higher education” correspond exactly to a four-year degree from Yale? Why can’t it be better, or worse? A Hyundai isn’t a Mercedes, but that doesn’t mean everybody has to drive a luxury car. And in many cases a shorter, more specialized – not to mention cheaper – curriculum is vastly superior to the bloated, politically correct, and increasingly irrelevant program offered by many of the prestige institutions.

Lately some traditional universities have been trying a new strategy, namely trying to incorporate the best features of the new platforms into the established models, a sort of Borg-like, assimilation strategy. An article Slate describes this trend, focusing on a “flipped” model in which students watch lectures at home, online, and do problems and exercises in class, with the help of instructors and classmates. I personally like the flipped model a lot and often use these techniques in the classroom. Some concepts are better taught using the lecture format, but why should I perform it live, and why should the students get it from me, if there is somebody else out there on the internet who can do it better? I’d rather spend my time working with the students alone or in small groups, after they’ve mastered the fundamentals. But therein lies the rub. The expensive, cumbersome, and rigid university structure is not particularly well suited for the flipped model. Most highly paid, tenure-track faculty aren’t trained to be in-class coaches and problem solvers. They may not be good at it – after all, they were trained to give lectures. Often there is little connection between their research and this kind of classroom activity, at least for undergraduate education. The coaching sessions can themselves be organized by lower-cost entrants, like the MOOC providers or community colleges or other local groups. You don’t need a huge university campus with a library, dorms, and football stadium to organize problem-solving sessions, and you don’t need overpaid professors to do it. There are exceptions – like graduate business schools that specialize in case-based instruction from highly-qualified discussion leaders (typically “clinical” professors who are former executives) – but in general, most scholars with PhDs are superfluous in this model.

If we had a free market for education, we would probably have far fewer schools, institutes, and programs, and we’d have a lot more diversity of structure and content. Sure, there would be some elite academies filled with top scholars who do research and train the next generation of top scholars. But we wouldn’t have thousands of universities copying that same basic structure at high cost and with little benefit.",lewrockwell.com,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

WASHINGTON, Oct. 30, 2005  Over two years after the end of Gulf War II, President Bush on Wednesday blamed rising violence in Iraq on the ""tremendous"" U.S. progress being made there, saying coalition successes are making insurgents more desperate.

Bush spoke only hours after the entire 1083rd Armored Company had been captured by Iraqi malcontents, on a day when bombings in Baghdad killed hundreds of people.

""The more progress we make on the ground, the more free the Iraqis become, the more electricity that’s available, the more jobs are available, the more kids that are going to school, the more things are gonna blow up,"" Bush told reporters. ""That’s just the way life is sometimes.""

Defense officials said loyalists of fallen Iraq leader Saddam Hussein likely were responsible for taking the 1083rd hostage, and for the bombings Monday at twenty-three police stations, the offices of ten aid organizations, and at the headquarters of the Iraqi government. ""It’s incredible that the two Saddam loyalists we haven’t yet captured could wreak so much havoc, but there you have it,"" commented one official.

Defense officials conceded that there was some possibility that the recent wave of violence was coordinated. For example, they admitted, it was hard to imagine that the fact that the pattern of bombings spelled out ""Go home, Yanks"" was entirely coincidental.

Bush said those who are continuing to engage in violence ""can’t stand the thought of a free society. They hate freedom. They hate cute little babies. They hate kittens. They love terror. They love cockroaches and fingernails squeaking on chalkboards.""

But Bush said he remains ""even more determined to work with the few remaining Iraqi people"" to restore peace and general niceness to the war-torn nation.

Said Paul Bremer, recently appointed as Grand Vizier of Iraq: ""We’ll have rough days, days where these terrorists may capture several hundred American troops and assassinate the entire Iraqi puppet regime… but the overall thrust is in the right direction and the good days outnumber the bad days. For example, on no other day this week did we lose an entire company of troops!""

As they have said following previous attacks over the last two-and-one-half years, U.S. officials vowed that the newest wave of violence will not deter them. Major General Ray Ordinario said, ""Nothing will prevent us from blindly following this hopeless… I mean, from systematically rooting out remnants of the former regime and training Iraqis to take over responsibility for security.""

Ordinario said that since September 10, his forces have conducted offensive raids and other missions that netted the capture of 6,231 mid-level former regime members, 143 explosives makers and 19 ""extremely bad"" karaoke singers. Ordinario said they also have seized $$1.5 million and plan on having ""one really big party back in the States"" with the money.

73532,"From ""Insatiable Government,"" June 25, 1932  Observe a strange bedfellowship. When the railroads throw themselves on the hands of the government and demand public credit to save them from bankruptcy, the radical forces do not protest, or, if they do, it is in an academic sense only; and the reason for this is that they believe in the public ownership of railroads, and see, perhaps more clearly than others, that such use of public credit tends to bring the experiment of state ownership to pass. For the same reason they protest lightly or not at all against the use of public credit to save the private banking structure, for that will tend to bring about state control of credit. They are for anything that tends to get the government into business.

From ""Concerning Inflation,"" November 4, 1933  Capital is in flight from the country. Every man with money, be it much or little, is thinking less about how he shall adventure it in a spirit of enterprise than how he shall make it safe  thinking less of interest and profit from his capital than how to defend his principal. This is true because the integrity of money is in doubt.

From ""Washington Miscellany,"" December 9, 1933  Frequencies are to broadcasting what tracks are to a railway and what wires are to telephone and telegraph. But broadcasting companies have no property right in frequencies. How can a wave length be owned? The Government allots to each broadcasting company a range of frequencies. This, of course, is necessary. That is, some authority would have to control and allot them or else there would be anarchy on the air. But the allotments are not permanent; they have to be renewed periodically, as if a railway had to go to the Government twice a year and get renewed permission to continue running trains on its tracks, or the telephone companies for permission to continue sending messages over their wires, with no possibility of there being other tracks or other wires.

It follows that broadcasting companies incline to keep the good will of the Government. On the other side, the Government takes leave to go on the air when and if it likes. It notifies the broadcasting companies that it wants certain time. The Government may say, ""We want the hour from seven to eight,"" and the companies move their things around accordingly. Thus the radio becomes, in some degree, an instrument of Government, and the Government makes effective use of it, more and more.

From ""The Balance Sheet of Capitalism,"" May 19, 1934  The whole of the emotional case against capitalism turns on the unequal distribution of wealth. But is it peculiar to the nature of capitalism to concentrate wealth in a few hands? Here the first aspect truth is a little hard. It begins with the human disparities; and for these, God is responsible, not capitalism. Much more, perhaps, than we wish to believe, economic inequalities answer to human inequalities.

Again and again, wealth has been socially divided and then, in a little while, it has been again as it was before, that a few were rich and many were not. Lycurgus, who did it for the Spartans, heaping all their wealth in one pile and then, dividing it equally, thought of measures to make this pleasing equality permanent. He banished gold and silver money and put in place of it iron money so heavy and so nearly worthless that to hoard or save it would be absurd. All the same, it was not long until again there were debtors and creditors and a concentration of wealth in the hands of a few.

Such a very old fact has a kind of simplicity. Somewhat more than nine-tenths of us consume all that we receive, and would consume it all, no matter how much it would be. The wish to accumulate wealth is universal; the will to do it belongs only to a few, and the proportion of those few in any kind of society has probably been constant for thousands of years.

From ""The Forgotten Road,"" September 29, 1934  Suppose every railroad that was unable to pay its debts had been permitted to go into receivership and thence to the auction block. What of it? The loss in that case would fall where it belonged  upon the stockholder. The stockholder is one who wants more than interest on his capital; he wants the profit. To be entitled to the profit, he must assume also the risk of loss. He knows that in the first place; he prefers the position of proprietorship and takes it voluntarily. He is the owner; the bondholders are his creditors. If the railroad is unable to pay its creditors and goes to the auction block, either the bondholders buy it in and wipe out the stock, or the stockholders, if they are unwilling to lose the property, may save themselves by putting in new capital. By that healthy process we had again and again, after every crisis, junked what was dead in our capital structure, and it was one secret of our economic strength that we did it in a ruthless manner, no matter how much it hurt. Between 1892 and 1896, 200 railroad companies, representing one-quarter of the country's total railway capital, went into receivership and were reorganized. In the next ten years the entire railroad system was rebuilt with new capital.

From ""When Wishes Think,"" February 23, 1935  When the New Deal arrived, prices had greatly fallen, and a great mass of repetitious, inflated and imaginary capital, founded on the rainbow, had been or was about to be wiped out, as it should have been. No tangible thing had been destroyed; it was only that everything had been revalued. That was deflation.

The idea first to be embraced by the New Deal was one for which a word had been invented. The word was ""reflation."" Not reinflation, which would mean to inflate again, but reflation, which means not the bite of the same dog but the dog of the same bite. The undertaking, very explicitly set forth, was to slay the dragon by raising prices to the predepression level  the average price of goods and commodities and labor to that level, and the price of agricultural commodities to a still higher level, on grounds of social justice; and whereas it had been the thought of business to defeat the dragon by defending prices on the pre-depression level, in which it failed, it was then for the New Deal to slay him by putting prices back to that level. Restoring prices would mean also to restore capital values of all kinds, even a great mass of that fictitious, inflated and imaginary capital, founded on the rainbow, that was about to be wiped out. That fact was let pass as a minor inconsistency. The New Dealers themselves never stressed it, and, besides, this was the sweetness that reconciled business and finance to much else that was sour to their taste.

From ""When Wishes Think,"" February 23, 1935  The old sequence in every depression was first a fall of prices, then a collapse of profits, then a reduction of money wages, and presently a terrific increase in production. A reduction in money wages is not the same thing as a fall in the buying power of wages. The buying power of wages is relative, determined by the cost of things.

The standard of living has had some minor setbacks, but never in this country was it ever sacrificed, never did anyone propose that it should be. On the contrary, during seventy-five years, from 1840 to 1914  notwithstanding three great depressions, the buying power of American wages increased threefold. There is no reason to suppose it would not be repeated in a free competitive system. Indeed, it cannot help repeating itself under that system, so long as production increases. If production is increased  simply that and nothing else  the buying power of wages is bound to rise. Either prices will be reduced or money wages will rise. This must happen by a law of necessity. There is no other way to dispose of the product.

The opposite is that you cannot buy any means increase the buying power of people without first increasing the quantity of things to be bought.

From ""When Wishes Think,"" February 23, 1935  War debts and depression debts possess the same character. All the things needful to conduct a war exist at the time. So why the fiction of borrowing them from the future? Why create a debt to represent them? In the same way, all the things needful to feed and clothe and house the unemployed exist in the present. Why a fiction of borrowing them from the future? Why create a debt to represent them? The reason in both cases is the wish to postpone and avoid payment. Let others pay. Let tomorrow pay. Let the next generation pay.

A war that was charged wholly to its own time, one paid for in full by taxation, would be a very unpopular war. But it would be a solvent war. So also with depression. Every depression hitherto has been paid for at the time. Such a thing as issuing bonds for relief was almost unknown. And that is why the recovery, when it came, was always so amazing. It had no load of debt to drag along; instead of it a new, unmortgaged future. Now for the first time we are trying to charge a depression to the future, though never before had we been so rich in all the means to pay for it ourselves.

From ""Economic Fascinations,"" March 9, 1935  A ship is one of the many implemental forms of wealth, and what is true of one form is true of every other form in the sense that follows… Under the free economic system, any private person possessing the capital is free to command the materials and labor to produce a ship… In the exercise of this right the private person must assume some risk. Suppose the ship does not pay, owing to the competition of many private persons doing the same thing. The owner, therefore, is unable to make a profit on his capital. What then? Well, in that case he may break the ship up or tie it up at his own risk; he may write away as much of its value as represents the disappointed expectation of profit and go on with it; he may turn it over to his creditors who, if they cannot make it pay, may put it on the auction block and sell it to someone who, if he buys it cheaply enough, is certain to make it pay. But in no case, under the free system, is it permitted that one who has created an unprofitable ship shall both deprive economic society of the benefit of cheaper transportation and save himself from loss by making the shipper pay him not to operate the ship. But that is the new way of thinking.

From ""The Wealth Question,"" August 31, 1935  Wheat farmers, corn farmers, hog farmers and others, signing up with the AAA and beginning to receive United States Treasury checks for what they did not produce, were generally pleased until they began slowly to reflect on what they had done. They had signed away the right to do as they pleased with their own land…

But if a farmer is not a lord on his own land, what is he? Would he give up being lord of his own land for a difference of forty or fifty cents in the price of wheat? Whether he would or not, he has done it.

From ""New Government,"" February 1, 1936  Before the New Deal, had Washington been feeling the depression?

Extremely. When the Republican Administration departed, in March, 1933, Washington, like nearly every other city, had the appearance of being overbuilt. The principal hotels and most of the new apartment houses were either in bankruptcy or staring at it. Private houses could be had for the taxes and upkeep. Many mansions were boarded up. Shops were closing, leaving whitened plate-glass windows behind them. Your taxi fare was less than the tip in New York and the driver was so grateful that you were ashamed. Elsewhere people might still be hopeful, not knowing the worst; but here, with all the sources drying up, it was not going to rain for four more years. Was not the incoming Administration pledged to lay the ax against government and cut it down one-quarter?

Then it rained. Miraculous rain from an invisible cloud in a new world. First the hotels filled up and overflowed. Next all the apartments and private houses were taken and they were not enough. Rents began to rise. The closed shops reopened. New ones appeared. Walking on errands of government ceased, because everyone was so earnestly making haste in the new world. The leisurely, old-fashioned left turn, wide around on the red light, had to be abandoned and one-way streets had to be ordained, owing to the increase in motor traffic. Taxicabs multiplied prodigiously. Gaiety took back its place in the life  eating, drinking, dancing, with all the most expensive places crowded; and touching all of this a kind of guilty embarrassment, as of people taking pleasure in unreconciled circumstances.

From ""National Hill Notes,"" February 29, 1936  Nobody ever exactly understood what the monetary policy was. It involved debasing the currency, repudiating the redemption clause engraved on all Government bonds, and led to the weird spectacle of the United States Treasury trying to raise the price of gold by buying it all over the world with paper dollars  not because it wanted the gold, or needed any more of it, but only for the purpose of making the price of gold go up. Foreigners sold us gold for paper dollars, and then used the paper dollars to buy American securities, so that in fact we were swapping titles of ownership in our industries and railroads for gold that we didn't need and didn't know what to do with. We have now more than half of all the monetary gold in the world, and yet we have no gold money. The Treasury is hoarding the gold. It could not spend it if it would, for the curious reason that by the law of this monetary policy it is a crime for an individual to possess a piece of gold.

From ""National Hill Notes,"" February 29, 1936  Acts in themselves do not constitute a course of action. From a progression of acts it may be possible to deduce a fundamental policy, only provided the acts are consistent with one another, or consistent as a whole with a controlling principle. But the acts of the New Deal bewilder that process. In the entire book of the New Deal's self-revelation and self-exegesis there is a certain paragraph that would reconcile all of its acts, not one with another but with one principle of contradiction. It is the passage in the last annual message in which suddenly the President speaks of the new instruments of governmental power that have been created, and then says of this new power that it is such that as in other hands ""would provide shackles for the liberties of the people."" But it is in his hands. Well, conquest of power for purposes of all-doing  that in itself could be a controlling policy, and such a policy, impossible to acknowledge, would involve many inconsistencies of immediate policy, because the peaceable course to the seizure of great political power is a zigzag path.

From ""Security,"" September 19, 1936  And how will [Social Security] funds of such magnitude be invested? They will be invested entirely in Government bonds. What is a Government bond? It is the promise of the Government to pay at some future time; it is, simply, the Government's promissory note. There is here one little difficulty to be cleared up. The inventors have not mentioned it. The difficulty is this: How can the Government earn money by investing money in its own promissory notes?

From American Affairs:

From ""Review and Comment,"" January 1946  By an act of seizure to end a strike the government is now in possession of the soft coal mines. Having nothing to lose but the taxpayers' money, the government is an easy and generous boss. To induce the miners to return to work it made a better bargain with them than the private boss was willing to make. And so, as it always is at first, the miners are better off.

Have they lost anything? Is this benefit of government without price? Suppose now they should want to strike. If they refused to mine the coal on the government's terms the would be striking against the government.

Note how the language changes. Formerly if the miners refused to mine coal one could say, when it became very serious, that they were striking against society, but that was an abstraction. Most people thought of it simply as an economic struggle in which the consumer was getting hurt, and public opinion turning strongly one way or the other would presently end it, because neither side could afford to go too far. But now when that same kind of struggle reaches a certain point the President announces that it begins to assume the character of a strike against the government, and that is a very different thing. Thus little by little we become accustomed first to the words and semantic tones and then to the experimental acts of authoritarian government, commanding obedience.

From ""Status for the Poor,"" April 1947  [It was a] proud American maxim that every schoolboy wrote in his copybook: To be poor is no disgrace. In the whole civilized world that was only true here, and it was true here because no stigma, no hint of caste, no sense of status attached itself to the condition of being poor…

But as the form of the Welfare State begins to rise…there are high-bracket people and low-bracket people and it is the law that makes a distinction between them. You may say still that the distinction is economic, not social, and this is for a while a supportable fiction. But it holds only until you come to public housing. There the line is struck, and now definitely a social status attaches to the condition of being poor…

The first argument for public housing is that it is the only way to reach that one-fifth of American families whose housing is substandard. The secondary argument is that although private enterprise has been freer here than anywhere else in the world, it has not solved this problem.

That way of speaking of private enterprise as if it were a power in itself, as if it were a total entity with parts and functions and responsibilities, belongs to the nonsense of modern demonology. There is no such demon. Private enterprise is not a thing. It is a body of natural spontaneous economic phenomena rising out of the activities of people who produce and exchange wealth with one another with no interference by government. It is not the function of private enterprise to house the people. It is the business of people to house themselves.

From ""Comment,"" January 1950  In the act of granting the railroads another increase in passenger rates the Interstate Commerce Commission suggested that if the railroads' passenger revenue continued to fall, Congress might have to consider a federal subsidy to make up the loss. At one of the hearings on Bigness before the Celler Committee this question was raised: What if a corporation got so big that the government, having accepted the responsibility of full employment, could not afford to let it fail? Thus one may note the birth of the idea that the Federal Government may be obliged to pay old age pensions for capital.

That idea was bound to follow from the delusion that by the free application of federal subsidies to any seat of pain we may secure the great blessing of a painless economy. This of course is quackery. There is no such thing as a painless economy; and if you overcome the sensation of pain by anesthetics, how shall the economy know when it is sick or why? The use of pain in a healthy body is to give notice of wrong living. The only way to cure it really is by right living. Many people have forgotten, if they ever knew, what happened in a free profit and loss system to capital when it ceased to earn a profit. If it could think of no way to get its profit back by improving its tools and methods, then simply it was lost  wiped out. But that is all that did happen. The great economic mechanism was not hurt at all. Indeed it was generally improved and worked much better when relieved of the weight of old and obsolete capital.

Before there was any Interstate Commerce Commission to say that railroad rates should be such as to guarantee a reasonable return on the capital, railroad bankruptcy was very common. Once two thirds of all the railroad mileage in the country was in receivership. The courts operated the railroads as trustees for the creditors. The trains went on running just the same; wages went on being paid to employees as before. Receivership certificates with prior lien on the assets were sold to buy new equipment and new rails. After a while the owners, who were the stockholders, sat down with the creditors, who were the bondholders, and together they worked out a reorganization plan. The capital structure was scaled down. The heavy loss fell on the stockholders, which was only fair, because for the sake of the profit they had voluntarily taken the owner's risk. Then a new company was formed, new stock was sold, the bankrupt railroad went on the block and was sold to the new company, and that was the end of receivership.

So American railroads were rebuilt many times, with new capital taking the place of old, and the cost of transportation fell until it was the lowest in the world. There was pain in it, of course, but it was pain that cured itself; and there came to be a hard saying of great wisdom  that the measure of the country's prosperity was the amount of bankruptcy it was willing to stand.

Oh god. There is no hope.

The other day I glanced at the web site of the Lake Chapala Society, a social club of sorts for expats around Mexico’s Lake Chapala, an hour south of Guadalajara (where I live). Clicking on Safety, I found a long list of reasons why you should never, ever use a firearm to protect your home and family. No. See, you might miss, or be scared, or the intruders might take it away and shoot you, and they might be all mad and hurt you when all they wanted was your television. No, the best thing is to let them do what they want, and then maybe they won’t do anything bad to you.

This supposedly was written by a retired cop but, if so, he (or quite possible she, judging by the tone) doesn’t sound like any cop I have known, which is whole lots. Anyway, his, her, or its advice, is Leave the guns to people who are trained and prepared to use them. Which he says he is.

Nuts. To begin with, cops usually know little about guns. They get a bit of training in the police academy, and then once or twice a year go to the range to fire a couple of magazines. Being actually good with a pistol requires putting tens of thousands of rounds downrange. Street shooting, which is what cops do in the unlikely event that they do any shooting at all, requires training of the sort offered by IPSC or, years back, Jeff Cooper and Chuck Taylor.

A few cops will learn on their own. When I went to shoot at the NRA range on Waples Mill Road in northern Virginia, I saw an occasional dedicated cop. But police departments don’t engage in real training because it costs a lot, takes a lot of time, and just isn’t worth it. The average cop never fires his weapon in line of duty. It serves chiefly as a badge of authority.

Smith (I’ll call him or her) implies further that no one who isn’t a cop knows how to use a pistol. He needs to get out more. In the small-town South of my boyhood, everybody had guns. We used them for hunting, for shooting varmints, and for plinking. My father gave me my first rifle when I was eleven in Athens, Alabama. In high school in Virginia, the first day of deer season was a school holiday because the teachers knew the boys would all be in the woods. When I was fifteen, friends and I often went to the dump in Colonial Beach at night to snap-shoot rats.

I later went to a federal fire-arms school at Parris Island in South Carolina. You may have heard of it. So did hundreds of thousands of other kids. The emphasis was on deadly force. At Camp Lejeune we did fire-and-maneuver with live ammo. (Also flamethrowers and 3.5"" rocket launchers, though I do not recommend these for home defense.) If Smith were to check the number of men who have gone through the Army or Marines, he would find that very large numbers of people have had training in the use of firearms.

But what I dislike most about Smith’s advice is his advocacy of helpless passivity. It embodies a profound change in American attitudes, which once favored self-reliance. Now it’s reliance on the group. Don’t take primary responsibility for your defense. No, that would be violent, or scary, or macho, and all. No, let the criminals do whatever they want with you, rely on their merciful natures, and call 911 if you survive.

This is exactly what Smith advocates. If I were a criminal, I would love this guy.

His advice is bad. He says, correctly enough, that most intruders want chiefly to steal things. Think a little. At two a.m., you hear a noise and turn on the lights. You find two guys with knives. You can now identify them. They have knives. Focus on this point. Knives, and you can identify them. Do you see where this leads?

If they leave you alive, you will call the cops immediately after they leave. They know this. If they tie you up, well, you are tied up in the presence of two career criminals with knives. This may work for Smith, but I’ll pass. It just isn’t optimal. If they leave you conscious and tied, you will begin shrieking for the neighbors as soon as they leave. The neighbors will call the cops — and you can identify the intruders.

In the real world, criminals are not always interested only in your television. They will accept such side benefits as offer. This engenders fascinating situations. They discover your daughter of sixteen in her bedroom. Hey, little girl, you’re real cute. Let’s get a better look. Take those pajamas off. You get to watch. They may or may not choose to leave witnesses.

If you think these things don’t happen, regularly, you have never been a policeman in a big city. A friend of mine, a Chicago cop, tells of arriving at the scene of a break-in. The intruders had beaten the man unconscious and, among other things they did to her, bitten the woman’s nipples off. Literally.

I remember going one night to a hospital with a DC cop to interview a rape victim of fifteen. She was screaming, sobbing, choking, the doctors trying to sedate her. Messed up for life. Smith is right: Don’t have a firearm in the house. It might make them mad. They just want your TV, see.

In Virginia to get a concealed-carry permit, you attend a mandatory class on how to use a pistol. One of the instructors when I did it was a (very competent) female agent of the FBI. She talked to the class, some of whom were women, about rape. She made the obvious point that very few women have the slightest chance of fending off a two-hundred pound deviate perhaps armed with a knife. A small concealed-hammer revolver, fired maybe through a coat pocket, can easily be handled by a woman of ninety pounds. Studies show that a rapist who has been shot several times loses ardor. We’re talking way beyond Viagra.

What is true of intruders is that they don’t want a firefight. When you rack a round into the chamber of a semi-auto, the sound is unmistakable and means only one thing: Someone is preparing to fire. You have to want a television very badly to go against someone who audibly is planning to kill you and audibly has the means.

You can do as Smith wants — let them do it, whatever it is, and then call a qualified professional. Or you can shoot the sons of bitches. Your choice. I don’t care.

743941,"Forget diversification. Jim Rogers has identified the world’s next great investment opportunity, and in a recent interview the famed guru said he is willing to put all his considerable fortune there.

So where is the planet’s best place to commit cash? According to Rogers, it’s the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Yes, that’s the formal name of what the world knows more simply as North Korea.

Rogers has also been talking about farming as a terrific investment in recent days. As he said at the end of last month to Simon Jack on BBC Radio 4’s “Today” show, “If you want to make a lot of money in the future—which many people do—you should learn to drive a tractor.”

Combining both statements, you would think Rogers believes that the very best opportunity in the world’s No. 1 hotspot is agriculture. There are two problems if you try to put your money into a North Korean farm, however. First, the DPRK, as North Koreans call their horrific state, is so primitive that most farming is done without mechanical devices. If you want to till the land there, you will need an ox. Second, you are not permitted to invest in North Korean farms.

In fact, it’s hard to invest in North Korea at all. The Pyongyang regime is wary of giving foreigners too much influence, so it severely limits what outsiders—especially non-Chinese—may buy or otherwise invest in.

Nonetheless, Rogers, who apparently believes in first-mover advantage, is worried that the Chinese and Russians will get too much of a head start. His idea is to get in on the ground floor, before unification of North and South Korea. “What you’ll have is a country of 70 odd million people with cheap, educated, disciplined labor in the North, vast natural resources . . . with a big capital pool and management capability in the South,” he says. “It will be a powerhouse.”

Rogers is in fact looking at two North Korean sectors, resources and commodities, but Chinese companies have already sewed up mining with either investments in mines or long-term purchase contracts, gobbling up almost all the North’s anthracite—they ended up with $$1.37 billion of such coal last year—and taking $$294.1 million of the North’s iron ore. They are also a sure bet to be the ones to exploit the North’s rare earth minerals as well. Unfortunately for Jim, there is almost no way in for Americans at this point.

216403,"At

a time of war, scandal, and national disunity, people across the

American family are increasingly wondering how we got here. 45 years

ago this week, departing President Dwight Eisenhower gave us our

answer.

It

was in his 1961 farewell address to the American people that Eisenhower

coined the phrase ""military-industrial

complex,"" an unholy alliance between the Pentagon and its contractors

that he saw gaining ""unwarranted influence"" over public

policy. Today, in more

ways than we know, these words haunt us.

Ironically,

fifteen years earlier, the heroic general of World War II had been

an advocate of military-industrial cooperation. ""The armed

forces could not have won the war alone,"" he wrote to Secretary

Stimson in 1946, ""Scientists and business men contributed techniques

and weapons which enabled us to outwit and overwhelm the enemy.""

As the 5-star General became President, he would learn firsthand

that the power of this alliance was growing out of control, tightening

its grip on even his own decision-making as President. ""God

help this country,"" a weary Eisenhower was overheard to say

in the Oval Office, ""when someone sits at this desk who doesn't

know as much about the military as I do.""

Over

the years, the term ""military-industrial complex"" has

been praised by some as prophecy and dismissed by others as the

work of a zealous speechwriter. Eisenhower's meticulous scribblings

over many drafts disprove the latter. Today, the power and influence

of the military-industrial complex seem self-evident. Yet beyond

this phrase, Eisenhower's remarkable farewell address is all but

forgotten in a world he foresaw down to the last shell-casing.

At

a time when a growing number of Americans are wondering how September

11 led to Shock and Awe and a war whose estimated cost may now exceed

$$2 trillion, Eisenhower cautions thus: ""Crises

there will continue to be. In meeting them, whether foreign or domestic,

great or small, there is a recurring temptation to feel that some

spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution

to all current difficulties.""

As

the path to Iraq saw the U.S. with arrogant impatience undermine

the credibility of U.N. member states that opposed an expedited

inspections timetable, Eisenhower reminds us of the importance,

however flawed, of instruments of international cooperation: ""Down

the long lane of the history yet to be written America knows that

this world of ours, ever growing smaller, must avoid becoming a

community of dreadful fear and hate, and be, instead, a proud confederation

of mutual trust and respect. Such a confederation must be one of

equals. The weakest must come to the conference table with the same

confidence as do we, protected as we are by our moral, economic,

and military strength. That table, though scarred by many past frustrations,

cannot be abandoned for the certain agony of the battlefield.""

As

proponents of the war on terror call for ever-increasing levels

of defense spending, we are reminded that Eisenhower, facing the

real prospect of intercontinental nuclear attack by the Soviet Union,

remained committed nonetheless to the view that ""disarmament,

with mutual honor and confidence, is a continuing imperative.""

At

a time when the rush to war seems now to have been engineered at

least in part by unelected operatives working in the shadows of

power at Think Tanks and other interest groups, Eisenhower warns

of ""the

potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power""

arising from the ""unwarranted influence""

of such forces.

Recently,

as scandals envelop Washington from Boeing to DeLay to Frist to

Abramoff, Eisenhower reminds us that ""the

power of money is ever-present and is gravely to be regarded.""

And

now, as the Executive Branch asserts privilege to abridge the civil

liberties of Americans in the name of prosecuting the war on terror,

Eisenhower challenges us to remain vigilant: ""We

should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable

citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and

military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals,

so that security and liberty may prosper together.""

While

all these concerns haunt our present condition, one phrase stands

out from the rest: ""the need to maintain balance in and

among national programs."" As we build bridges and print

textbooks for the children of Iraq while our own children are uneducated

and drowning in the streets of New Orleans, it becomes clear that

Eisenhower has a notion of balance that embarrasses our own.

Perhaps

it was his experience on the battlefield. Or even the values his

pacifist mother instilled in him. Or maybe it was just plain-old

Kansas common sense. Whichever, Eisenhower understood that a nation's

defense is about more than just bombs. He understood that a country

that allocates a disproportionate share of its wealth toward defense

and away from other aspects of its national life is a country driven

by an incomplete vision of national defense. In the final analysis,

he understood that an uneducated country is an undefended country,

that a country without adequate health care is an undefended country,

that a country in debt is an undefended country, that a country

without friends and allies is an undefended country, and above all,

that a country whose people have lost faith in their leaders, is

an undefended country.

""This

is not a way of life at all, in any true sense,""

Eisenhower declared at an earlier time in his career. ""Under

the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross

of iron.""

171102,"Classical liberalism — or simply liberalism, as it was called until around the turn of the century — is the signature political philosophy of Western civilization. Hints and suggestions of the liberal idea can be found in other great cultures. But it was the distinctive society produced in Europe — and in the outposts of Europe, and above all America — that served as the seedbed of liberalism. In turn, that society was decisively shaped by the liberal movement.

Decentralization and the division of power have been the hallmarks of the history of Europe. After the fall of Rome, no empire was ever able to dominate the continent. Instead, Europe became a complex mosaic of competing nations, principalities, and city-states. The various rulers found themselves in competition with each other. If one of them indulged in predatory taxation or arbitrary confiscations of property, he might well lose his most productive citizens, who could “exit,” together with their capital. The kings also found powerful rivals in ambitious barons and in religious authorities that were backed by an international Church. Parliaments emerged that limited the taxing power of kings, and free cities arose with special charters that put the merchant elite in charge.

By the Middle Ages, many parts of Europe, especially in the west, had developed a culture friendly to property rights and trade. On the philosophical level, the doctrine of natural law — deriving from the Stoic philosophers of Greece and Rome — taught that the natural order was independent of human design and that rulers were subordinate to the eternal laws of justice. Natural-law doctrine was upheld by the Church and promulgated in the great universities, from Oxford and Salamanca to Prague and Krakow.

As the modern age began, rulers started to shake free of age-old customary constraints on their power. Royal absolutism became the main tendency of the time. The kings of Europe raised a novel claim: they declared that they were appointed by God to be the fountainhead of all life and activity in society. Accordingly, they sought to direct religion, culture, politics, and, especially, the economic life of the people. To support their burgeoning bureaucracies and constant wars, the rulers required ever-increasing quantities of taxes, which they tried to squeeze out of their subjects in ways that were contrary to precedent and custom.

The first people to revolt against this system were the Dutch. After a struggle that lasted for decades, they won their independence from Spain and proceeded to set up a unique polity. The United Provinces, as the radically decentralized state was called, had no king and little power at the federal level. Making money was the passion of these busy manufacturers and traders; they had no time for hunting heretics or suppressing new ideas. Thus de facto religious toleration and a wide-ranging freedom of the press came to prevail. Devoted to industry and trade, the Dutch established a legal system based solidly on the rule of law and the sanctity of property and contract. Taxes were low, and everyone worked. The Dutch “economic miracle” was the wonder of the age. Thoughtful observers throughout Europe noted the Dutch success with great interest.

A society in many ways similar to Holland had developed across the North Sea. In the 17th century, England, too, was threatened by royal absolutism, in the form of the House of Stuart. The response was revolution, civil war, the beheading of one king and the booting out of another. In the course of this tumultuous century, the first movements and thinkers appeared that can be unequivocally identified as liberal.

With the king gone, a group of middle-class radicals emerged called the Levellers. They protested that not even Parliament had the authority to usurp the natural, God-given rights of the people. Religion, they declared, was a matter of individual conscience; it should have no connection with the state. State-granted monopolies were likewise an infringement of natural liberty.

A generation later, John Locke, drawing on the tradition of natural law that had been kept alive and elaborated by the Scholastic theologians, set forth a powerful liberal model of man, society, and state. Every man, he held, is innately endowed with certain natural rights. These consist in his fundamental right to what is his property — that is, his life, liberty, and “estates” (or material goods). Government is formed simply to preserve the right to property. When, instead of protecting the natural rights of the people, a government makes war upon them, the people may alter or abolish it. The Lockean philosophy continued to exert influence in England for generations to come. In time, its greatest impact would be in the English-speaking colonies in North America.

The society that emerged in England after the victory over absolutism began to score astonishing successes in economic and cultural life. Thinkers from the continent, especially in France, grew interested. Some, like Voltaire and Montesquieu, came to see for themselves. Just as Holland had acted as a model before, now the example of England began to influence foreign philosophers and statesmen. The decentralization that has always marked Europe allowed the English “experiment” to take place and its success to act as a spur to other nations.

In the 18th century, thinkers were discovering a momentous fact about social life: given a situation where men enjoyed their natural rights, society more or less ran itself. In Scotland, a succession of brilliant writers that included David Hume and Adam Smith outlined the theory of the spontaneous evolution of social institutions. They demonstrated how immensely complex and vitally useful institutions — language, morality, the common law, and above all the market — originate and develop not as the product of the designing minds of social engineers, but as the result of the interactions of all the members of society pursuing their individual goals.

In France, economists were coming to similar conclusions. The greatest of them, A.R.J. Turgot, set forth the rationale for the free market:

The policy to pursue, therefore, is to follow the course of nature, without pretending to direct it. For, in order to direct trade and commerce it would be necessary to be able to have knowledge of all of the variations of needs, interests, and human industry in such detail as is physically impossible to obtain even by the most able, active, and circumstantial government. And even if a government did possess such a multitude of detailed knowledge, the result would be to let things go precisely as they do of themselves, by the sole action of the interests of men prompted by free competition.

The French economists coined a term for the policy of freedom in economic life — they called it laissez-faire. Meanwhile, starting in the early 17th century, colonists coming mainly from England had established a new society on the eastern shores of North America. Under the influence of the ideas that the colonists brought with them and the institutions they developed, a unique way of life came into being. There was no aristocracy and very little government of any kind. Instead of aspiring to political power, the colonists worked to carve out a decent existence for themselves and their families.

Fiercely independent, they were equally committed to the peaceful — and profitable — exchange of goods. A complex network of trade sprang up, and by the mid-18th century the colonists were already more affluent than any other commoners in the world. Self-help was the guiding star in the realm of spiritual values as well. Churches, colleges, lending libraries, newspapers, lecture institutes, and cultural societies flourished through the voluntary cooperation of the citizens.

When events led to a war for independence, the prevailing view of society was that it basically ran itself. As Tom Paine declared,

Formal government makes but a small part of civilized life. It is to the great and fundamental principles of society and civilization — to the unceasing circulation of interest, which passing through its million channels, invigorates the whole mass of civilized man — it is to these, infinitely more than to anything which even the best instituted government can perform that the safety and prosperity of the individual and the whole depend. In fine, society performs for itself almost everything which is ascribed to government. Government is no further necessary than to supply the few cases to which society and civilization are not conveniently competent.

In time, the new society formed on the philosophy of natural rights would serve as an even more luminous exemplar of liberalism to the world than had Holland and England before it.

As the 19th century began, classical liberalism — or just liberalism, as the philosophy of freedom was then known — was the specter haunting Europe — and the world. In every advanced country the liberal movement was active.

Drawn mainly from the middle classes, it included people from widely contrasting religious and philosophical backgrounds. Christians, Jews, deists, agnostics, utilitarians, believers in natural rights, freethinkers, and traditionalists all found it possible to work towards one fundamental goal: expanding the area of the free functioning of society and diminishing the area of coercion and the state.

Emphases varied with the circumstances of different countries. Sometimes, as in central and eastern Europe, the liberals demanded the rollback of the absolutist state and even the residues of feudalism. Accordingly, the struggle centered on full private-property rights in land, religious liberty, and the abolition of serfdom. In western Europe, the liberals often had to fight for free trade, full freedom of the press, and the rule of law as sovereign over state functionaries.

In America, the liberal country par excellence, the chief aim was to fend off incursions of government power pushed by Alexander Hamilton and his centralizing successors, and, eventually, somehow, to deal with the great stain on American freedom — Negro slavery.

From the standpoint of liberalism, the United States was remarkably lucky from the start. Thomas Jefferson, one of the leading liberal thinkers of his time, composed its founding document, the Declaration of Independence. The Declaration radiated the vision of society as consisting of individuals enjoying their natural rights and pursuing their self-determined goals. In the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, the Founders created a system where power would be divided, limited, and hemmed in by multiple constraints, while individuals could go about the quest for fulfillment through work, family, friends, self-cultivation, and the dense network of voluntary associations. In this new land, government — as European travelers noted with awe — could hardly be said to exist at all. This was the America that became a model to the world.

One perpetuator of the Jeffersonian tradition in the early 19th century was William Leggett, a New York journalist and antislavery, Jacksonian Democrat. Leggett declared,

All governments are instituted for the protection of person and property; and the people only delegate to their rulers such powers as are indispensable to these objects. The people want no government to regulate their private concerns, or to prescribe the course and mete out the profits of their industry. Protect their persons and property, and all the rest they can do for themselves.

This laissez-faire philosophy became the bedrock creed of countless Americans of all classes. In the generations to come, it found an echo in the work of liberal writers like E.L. Godkin, Albert Jay Nock, H.L. Mencken, Frank Chodorov, and Leonard Read. To the rest of the world, this was the distinctively, characteristically American outlook.

Meanwhile, the economic advance that had been slowly gaining momentum in the Western world burst out in a great leap forward. First in Britain, then in America and western Europe, the Industrial Revolution transformed the life of man as nothing had since the Neolithic age. Now it became possible for the vast majority of mankind to escape the immemorial misery they had grown to accept as their unalterable lot. Now tens of millions who would have perished in the inefficient economy of the old order were able to survive. As the populations of Europe and America swelled to unprecedented levels, the new masses gradually achieved living standards unimaginable for working people before.

The birth of the industrial order was accompanied by economic dislocations. How could it have been otherwise? The free-market economists preached the solution: security of property and hard money to encourage capital formation, free trade to maximize efficiency in production, and a clear field for entrepreneurs eager to innovate. But conservatives, threatened in their age-old status, initiated a literary assault on the new system, giving the Industrial Revolution a bad name from which it never fully recovered. Soon the attack was gleefully taken up by groups of socialist intellectuals that began to emerge.

Still, by midcentury the liberals went from one victory to another. Constitutions with guarantees of basic rights were adopted, legal systems firmly anchoring the rule of law and property rights were put in place, and free trade was spreading, giving birth to a world economy based on the gold standard.

There were advances on the intellectual front as well. After spearheading the campaign to abolish the British Corn Laws, Richard Cobden developed the theory of nonintervention in the affairs of other countries as a foundation for peace. Frédéric Bastiat put the case for free trade, nonintervention, and peace in a classic form. Liberal historians like Thomas Macaulay and Augustin Thierry uncovered the roots of freedom in the West. Later in the century, the economic theory of the free market was placed on a secure scientific footing with the rise of the Austrian School, inaugurated by Carl Menger.

The relation of liberalism and religion presented a special problem. In continental Europe and Latin America, freethinking liberals sometimes used the state power to curtail the influence of the Catholic Church, while some Catholic leaders clung to obsolete ideas of theocratic control. But liberal thinkers like Benjamin Constant, Alexis de Tocqueville, and Lord Acton saw beyond such futile disputes. They stressed the crucial role that religion, separated from government power, could play in stemming the growth of the centralized state. In this way, they prepared the ground for the reconciliation of liberty and religious faith.

Then, for reasons still unclear, the tide began to turn against the liberals. Part of the reason is surely the rise of the new class of intellectuals that proliferated everywhere. That they owed their very existence to the wealth generated by the capitalist system did not prevent most of them from incessantly gnawing away at capitalism, indicting it for every problem they could point to in modern society.

At the same time, voluntary solutions to these problems were preempted by state functionaries anxious to expand their domain. The rise of democracy may well have contributed to liberalism’s decline by aggravating an age-old feature of politics — the scramble for special privilege. Businesses, labor unions, farmers, bureaucrats, and other interest groups vied for state privileges — and found intellectual demagogues to rationalize their depredations. The area of state control grew, at the expense, as William Graham Sumner pointed out, of “the forgotten man” — the quiet, productive individual who asks no favor of government and, through his work, keeps the whole system going.

By the end of the 19th century, liberalism was being battered on all sides. Nationalists and imperialists condemned it for promoting an insipid peace instead of a virile and bracing belligerency among the nations. Socialists attacked it for upholding the “anarchical” free-market system instead of “scientific” central planning. Even church leaders disparaged liberalism for its alleged egotism and materialism.

In America and Britain, social reformers around the dawn of the 20th century conceived a particularly clever gambit. Anywhere else the supporters of state intervention and coercive labor-unionism would have been called “socialists” or “social democrats.” But since the English-speaking peoples appeared for some reason to have an aversion to those labels, they hijacked the term “liberal.”

Though they fought on to the end, a mood of despondency settled on the last of the great authentic liberals. When Herbert Spencer began writing in the 1840s, he had looked forward to an age of universal progress in which the coercive state apparatus would practically disappear. By 1884, Spencer could pen an essay entitled “The Coming Slavery.” In 1898, William Graham Sumner, American Spencerian, free-trader, and gold-standard advocate, looked with dismay as America started on the road to imperialism and global entanglement in the Spanish-American War; he titled his response to that war, grimly, “The Conquest of the United States by Spain.”

Everywhere in Europe there was a reversion to the policies of the absolutist state, as government bureaucracies expanded. At the same time, jealous rivalries among the Great Powers led to a frenzied arms race and sharpened the threat of war. In 1914, a Serb assassin threw a spark onto the heaped-up animosity and suspicion, and the result was the most destructive war in history to that point. In 1917, an American president keen to create a New World Order led his country into the murderous conflict.

“War is the health of the state,” warned the radical writer Randolph Bourne. And so it proved to be. By the time the butchery ended, many believed that liberalism in its classical sense was dead.

The First World War was the watershed of the 20th century. Itself the product of antiliberal ideas and policies, such as militarism and protectionism, the Great War fostered statism in every form. In Europe and America, the trend towards state intervention accelerated, as governments conscripted, censored, inflated, ran up mountains of debts, co-opted business and labor, and seized control of the economy. Everywhere “progressive” intellectuals saw their dreams coming true. The old laissez-faire liberalism was dead, they gloated, and the future belonged to collectivism. The only question seemed to be, which kind of collectivism?

In Russia, the chaos of the war permitted a small group of Marxist revolutionaries to grab power and establish a field headquarters for world revolution. In the 19th century, Karl Marx had concocted a secular religion with a potent appeal. It held out the promise of the final liberation of man through replacing the complex, often baffling world of the market economy by conscious, “scientific” control.

Put into practice by Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky in Russia, the Marxist economic experiment resulted in catastrophe. For the next seventy years, Red rulers lurched from one patchwork expedient to another. But terror kept them firmly in charge, and the most colossal propaganda effort in history convinced intellectuals both in the West and in the emerging Third World that Communism was, indeed, “the radiant future of all mankind.”

The peace treaties cobbled together by President Woodrow Wilson and the other Allied leaders left Europe a seething cauldron of resentment and hate. Seduced by nationalist demagogues and terrified of the Communist threat, millions of Europeans turned to the forms of state worship called fascism and National Socialism, or Nazism. Though riddled with economic error, these doctrines promised prosperity and national power through integral state control of society, while fomenting more and greater wars.

In the democratic countries, milder forms of statism were the rule. Most insidious of all was the form that had been invented in the 1880s, in Germany. There Otto von Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor, devised a series of old-age, disability, accident, and sickness insurance schemes, run by the state. The German liberals of the time argued that such plans were simply a reversion to the paternalism of the absolutist monarchies. Bismarck won out, and his invention — the welfare state — was eventually copied everywhere in Europe, including the totalitarian countries. With the New Deal, the welfare state came to America.

Still, private property and free exchange continued as the basic organizing principles of Western economies. Competition, the profit motive, the steady accumulation of capital (including human capital), free trade, the perfecting of markets, increased specialization — all worked to promote efficiency and technical progress and with them higher living standards for the people. So powerful and resilient did this capitalist engine of productivity prove to be that widespread state intervention, coercive labor-unionism, even government-generated depressions and wars could not check economic growth in the long run.

The 1920s and ’30s represent the nadir of the classical-liberal movement in the 20th century. Especially after government meddling with the monetary system led to the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, dominant opinion held that history had closed the books on competitive capitalism, and with it the liberal philosophy.

If a date were to be put on the rebirth of classical liberalism, it would be 1922, the year of the publication of Socialism, by the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises. One of the most remarkable thinkers of the century, Mises was also a man of unflinching courage. In Socialism, he threw down the gauntlet to the enemies of capitalism. In effect, he said, “You accuse the system of private property of causing all social evils, which only socialism can cure. Fine. But would you now kindly do something you have never deigned to do before: would you explain how a complex economic system will be able to operate in the absence of markets, and hence prices, for capital goods?” Mises demonstrated that economic calculation without private property was impossible, and exposed socialism for the passionate illusion it was.

Mises’s challenge to the prevailing orthodoxy opened the minds of thinkers in Europe and America. F.A. Hayek, Wilhelm Röpke, and Lionel Robbins were among those whom Mises converted to the free market. And, throughout his very long career, Mises elaborated and refined his economic theory and social philosophy, becoming the acknowledged premier classical-liberal thinker of the 20th century.

In Europe and particularly in the United States, scattered individuals and groups kept something of the old liberalism alive. At the London School of Economics and the University of Chicago, academics could be found, even in the 1930s and ’40s, who defended at least the basic validity of the free-enterprise idea.

In America, an embattled brigade of brilliant writers, mainly journalists, survived. Now known as the “Old Right,” they included Albert Jay Nock, Frank Chodorov, H.L. Mencken, Felix Morley, and John T. Flynn. Spurred to action by the totalitarian implications of Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal, these writers reiterated the traditional American creed of individual freedom and scornful distrust of government. They were equally opposed to Roosevelt’s policy of global meddling as subversive of the American Republic. Supported by a few courageous publishers and businessmen, the “Old Right” nursed the flame of Jeffersonian ideals through the darkest days of the New Deal and the Second World War.

With the end of that war, what can be called a movement came into being. Small at first, it was fed by multiplying streams. Hayek’s Road to Serfdom, published in 1944, alerted many thousands to the reality that, in pursuing socialist policies, the West was risking the loss of its traditional free civilization.

In 1946, Leonard Read established The Foundation for Economic Education, in Irvington, New York, publishing the works of Henry Hazlitt and other champions of the free market. Mises and Hayek, now both in the United States, continued their work. Hayek led in founding the Mont Pelerin Society, a group of classical-liberal scholars, activists, and businessmen from all over the world. Mises, unsurpassed as a teacher, set up a seminar at New York University, attracting such students as Murray Rothbard and Israel Kirzner. Rothbard went on to wed the insights of Austrian economics to the teachings of natural law to produce a powerful synthesis that appealed to many of the young. At the University of Chicago, Milton Friedman, George Stigler, and Aaron Director led a group of classical-liberal economists whose specialty was exposing the defects of government action. The gifted novelist Ayn Rand incorporated emphatically libertarian themes in her well-crafted bestsellers, and even founded a school of philosophy.

The reaction to the renewal of authentic liberalism on the part of the left — “liberals” — more accurately, the social-democrat establishment — was predictable, and ferocious. In 1954, for instance, Hayek edited a volume entitled Capitalism and the Historians, a collection of essays by distinguished scholars arguing against the prevailing socialist interpretation of the Industrial Revolution. A scholarly journal permitted Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Harvard professor and New Deal hack, to savage the book in these terms: “Americans have enough trouble with home-grown McCarthys without importing Viennese professors to add academic luster to the process.”

Other works the establishment tried to kill by silence. As late as 1962, not a single prominent magazine or newspaper chose to review Friedman’s Capitalism and Freedom. Still, the writers and activists who led the revival of classical liberalism found a growing resonance among the public. Millions of Americans in all walks of life had all along quietly cherished the values of the free market and private property. The growing presence of a solid corps of intellectual leaders now gave many of these citizens the heart to stand up for the ideas they had held dear for so long.

In the 1970s and ’80s, with the evident failure of socialist planning and interventionist programs, classical liberalism became a worldwide movement. In Western countries, and then, incredibly, in the nations of the former Warsaw Pact, political leaders even declared themselves disciples of Hayek and Friedman. As the end of the century approached, the old, authentic liberalism was alive and well, stronger than it had been for a hundred years.

And yet, in Western countries, the state keeps on relentlessly expanding, colonizing one area of social life after the other. In America, the Republic is fast becoming a fading memory, as federal bureaucrats and global planners divert more and more power to the center. So the struggle continues, as it must. Two centuries ago, when liberalism was young, Jefferson had already informed us of the price of liberty.

370027,"Part 1: Games People Play Part 2: The Hunger for Truth and the Role of the Media

For libertarians in particular, conspiracy theories share a common concern with the abuse of power. In contrast to the cowardice and kow-towing to the established political and economic order practised by the mainstream and politically correct media, libertarians can actually take much of the so-called conspiracy theory comfortably in their stride  because they know that those in government are, in Murray Rothbard's words, a professional criminal class.

Well-meaning non-libertarians protest this attitude, with remarks along the lines of u2018How can you be so cynical about our democratically elected representatives?' or u2018How can you believe that such violent acts could be perpetrated by these people?' To which one can only respond that they have not learned the lessons of history, have not understood Lord Acton's dictum that u2018power corrupts…,' have forgotten that Hitler was democratically elected, and most likely have not taken in what Machiavelli or Zbigniew Brzezinski have to say about the strategic imperatives of empires and their rulers.

Like any other such grouping, the professional-criminal class of politicians will conspire, that is to say, they will meet together to plan and organize their actions. Who knows, they may even conspire to do good  there is no golden rule which says that all conspiracy has to be bad in intent: some of the worst outcomes of government action, like the New Deal in its effects on agriculture, emerged from plans and regulations made with the best of intentions by well-meaning people.

Nevertheless, such groups will also conspire continually to develop and perfect their techniques for staying ahead of opponents or potential challengers, both domestic and foreign. When applied to government, this mission statement, implicitly understood and absorbed by all members of the group, leads to a natural tendency to consolidate power, to conduct its proceedings in ever greater secrecy, to restricting the free flow of information, and to the erosion of the personal and civil liberties of the ruled. Thus too it is almost inevitable that over time, the holders of office will want to restrict even more whatever degree of freedom of access to information exists.

These tendencies have long been understood, and underpin the institution of all systems which limit executive powers such as written constitutions and charters of rights. I have suggested earlier that conspiracy theories flourish at the heart of empire, and indeed those in the US are flourishing and are of particular interest today precisely because the US is the heart of the global empire and the centre of power, not just geo-strategically, but in economic and cultural terms as well, and that is why it is relevant to examine specifically what goes on there. But I also believe it is because many people in the US feel that the limitations of power and popular rights and liberties, whether formally embodied or not in the Constitution or the Bill of Rights, are under a fiercer challenge today than ever before, and this factor too has brought more sharply into the limelight those specific events which conspiracy theories usually address — the assassination of political opponents, transparently improbable suicides, imprisonment without trial, spying and surveillance, and imperial conquest, to name just a few which spring immediately to mind.

In the past the nature of the electoral process in the US meant that the elected political class generally had a short (4-year) window of opportunity for emptying the collective treasury to its own benefit, or for pursuing other, even more ambitious, items on its agenda such as conquering other nation-states — or perhaps I should say u2018making them safe for democracy.'

What is interesting, and perhaps sinister, about the current administration — and could be another reason for the upsurge in conspiracy theories  is its close linkages to the past, both in terms of the personnel line-up, and in the fact that many of its pet projects, like the invasion and break-up of Iraq, have been much longer in the planning  as long as 10 years or more  than the normal, shorter period covering the days preceding the take-up by a new administration and its early days in office.

Truly, for the figures behind the throne who have prepared and honed these projects, I believe the reign of Clinton was seen as a mere interlude, or what has jokingly been labelled sex between the Bushes. All the while the plans were being refined, and occasionally road-tested, as in the intense campaign for greater military intervention surrounding the so-called Iraq Liberation Act of 1998.

It is in this context too that we should understand the moves to restrict access to the presidential archives of the administrations which ruled from 1980 to 1992: every effort is being made to hide and play down embarrassing facts such as the continuity of policy by default (masking the absence of any new policies of any substance, a factor which had led to increasing institutional malaise and all-time administration popularity lows in polls taken prior to September 11th 2001), the appointment of a Cold War expert to the position of National Security Adviser some 10 years after that u2018war' had ended, the re-emergence of previously indicted criminals into positions of decision-making power and influence today, and who knows, the true nature of some of the political covenants and deals made by the corporations previously headed by officers of the present government and their buddies.

This perfecting of the techniques for holding on to power and expanding the empire, by taking a longer-term view (one of those long-term plans, incidentally, is called the u2018Project for the new American century'), has tended to undermine the rotational cycle whereby each of the major parties took its turn at the trough (whether in Presidential or in mid-term Congressional elections). Although it is by no means the only factor in the current consolidation of state power and erosion of freedom, it has undoubtedly helped to consolidate the power which remains in the hands of the victorious party, to the ultimate detriment of the cause of liberty.

In such a scenario there is a natural tendency for those who do not hold power to incline towards the conspiracy theory view of things — if only because the Leviathan has become much bigger and more dangerous than before, and has made great strides in the art of disguise, so that, while information is still coming out, no-one knows for sure if it isn't disinformation, planted in the media at strategic moments to befuddle and confuse the petrified masses still further.

Conclusions

At a certain point in the courtroom drama part of the 1992 film ""A Few Good Men,"" there is a dialogue, which has now become legendary, between the army camp commandant Colonel Jessup (played by Jack Nicholson) and the young naval attorney Kaffee (played by Tom Cruise):

Col. Jessup: You want answers? Kaffee: I think I’m entitled. Col. Jessup: You want answers? Kaffee: I want the truth! Col. Jessup: You can’t handle the truth!

Notice how Jessup ignores Kaffee's I think I'm entitled (to answers). As with so much in our age of political correctness, the debate on conspiracy theories is dominated by those who fear that the truth may be misinterpreted, or get into the wrong hands. They are judge and jury, and they conclude that at a certain moment in the process of consolidation of power it is better that the truth get into no hands at all. Which of course is tantamount to usurping total power for the rulers, and at the same time saying, for public and international consumption, that individuals are incapable of taking responsibility, of thinking for themselves, so the all-powerful state must look after them.

But, just as in education, if you have no expectations of people, you should not subsequently be surprised if they fail to perform. You have to have positive expectations of people, give them the benefit of the doubt, and believe that they can indeed u2018handle the truth.'

And so it should be with investigative reporting and uncomfortable truths. As I have suggested in an earlier part of this series, it is up to the individual man or woman, the individual reader or viewer as the case may be, to decide if the u2018conspiracy theory' is the whole truth, has elements of truth in it, has pointers to the truth or to alternative angles on a given story, or is indeed a load of rubbish. He or she may come to the wrong conclusion, but it is far better that he should be free to make the investigative journey and do so, that he should have the knowledge made available to him and explore it fully, than that he should forever be mollycoddled with comforting myths or diversions on the part of the state and its media propaganda machine.

For no state or government will ever protect him or her. At best, it will perhaps provide a secretly located bunker for a few of its own. For the rest, those myths and diversions may offer temporary relief — but inevitably only until the next terrorist outrage takes place, naturally arranged, conspiracy theorists would say, by henchmen of the rulers, and hallmarked to look like the work of the latest terrorist bogeyman. Or the next ever so conveniently timed plane crash.

In the final analysis, if my reader-viewer has the full information but makes the wrong judgement, there is always a chance that he will learn, and get it right the next time. If he stays in the dark, or through private fear, social embarrassment or abject surrender to the threat of intimidation decides that he will not open the door and step out into the light, then he has only himself to blame if he wakes up enslaved.

Oh, and I almost forgot. Regarding November 22nd, 1963. Forget the conspiracy theories. Lee Harvey Oswald did it. How can we be so sure? Because he had a magic bullet, and it had u2018JFK' written all over it.

372708,"At one time I lived very close to the Field Museum of Chicago; I had a membership and spent a good deal of time there. One evening, about ten minutes before closing, I noticed that workmen had begun preparing the first floor for an evening event. I had a panoramic view from where I stood at the second floor balcony, and what I saw has stuck with me ever since.

What I saw was a lone man setting up tables and chairs – simple work, the kind that any teenager could do. But what I watched this man do was every bit as beautiful as dance. He moved with integrity, with precision, and with intent. He carefully spaced the tables in a precise geometry, he moved every chair with efficiency. This was more than just work; it was also art. This man knew that he was doing his job well, and, perhaps most importantly, heenjoyed doing it well.

I was transfixed by it all, and I stood there until the guards asked me to leave. And even then, I moved very slowly until I lost sight of him.

There is real beauty in doing a job well, even a simple job. It is our great loss that this form of beauty is never mentioned in public these days – double-sad, because at one time, such beautywas acknowledged.

This brings us to an obvious question: What happened? How did we lose the beauty and dignity of work? I’ll answer that in a moment, but first I want to explain what I mean by “theproductive class.”

The productive class includes all those people who are engaged in improving life upon Earth: The people who build and repair our cars, our houses, and our computers. The people who provide us with air conditioning, electricity, plumbing, and food. The people who make, clean, and repair our clothing. The people who treat our sicknesses and wounds.

If you can drive around town and point out places where you repaired things, or delivered things, or fed people, or made human life better in any of a thousand ways, you are a producer.

If you survive and persist at the expense of others, on the other hand, you are not a producer.

But if you are a producer, there is an inherent dignity in what you do. You are actively making the world better. You are directly creating benefit for yourself and for other human beings. What you do every day is morally virtuous and worthy of respect. And you should never let anyone tell you otherwise.

And, it’s worth pointing out: Money is not a measure of your worth. In a perfect world, that might be true, but this isn’t a perfect world. In our time, morality and money don’t always travel together.

Money is certainly useful, and getting it should matter to you, but merely having money is no measure of your dignity or your value as a producer. Actively improving the world, however – producing – is a proper measure of dignity.

501850,"I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; (1 Timothy 2:1)

While driving recently on Maitland Boulevard in central Florida, I came upon a billboard with a simple message: “Pray for Our Troops.”

Although I am often very critical of the actions of U.S. troops, I do believe—in spite of what people may think—in prayer for our troops. This is because, as evidenced above, the Bible exhorts us to pray for all men, which includes U.S. troops.

The problem is not the idea of praying for the troops, but the usual prayers that are offered on their behalf. When the typical church-going, prayer-saying American Christian sees such a billboard or is enjoined in church to pray for our troops, he generally thinks:

Pray that our troops be kept out of harm’s way.

Pray that our troops defeat our enemies.

Pray that our troops eliminate the threat of al Qaeda.

Pray that our troops rid the world of weapons of mass destruction.

Pray that our troops spread democracy and freedom.

Pray that our troops avenge 9/11.

Some Christians, if they were honest, would pray that our troops’ bombs, bullets, grenades, missiles, and mortars hit their targets. Or if they were really honest, a war prayer for the twenty-first century.

The problem with these prayers is that no thought is ever given to:

Where our troops go.

Why our troops go.

Whether our troops should go.

How long our troops should stay.

What our troops do when they are there.

How much it costs to keep our troops there.

How many innocent foreigners die because our troops went.

What physical and mental condition our troops will be in when they return.

Whether our troops are really defending our freedom.

Whether our troops are creating more terrorists because they went. War, Christianity, and... Laurence M. Vance Best Price: $$5.00 Buy New $$9.95 (as of 07:50 EST - Details )

Whether our troops are actually a global force for good.

Whether whatever our troops accomplish is worth one drop of American blood.

None of these things matter. We are continually told to pray for the troops, thank the troops, and support the troops—and to do so unconditionally.

But because I have considered these questions about the activities of our troops, and pay attention to what really goes on in the military, I think we should instead:

Pray that our troops come home from overseas.

Pray that our troops stop fighting foreign wars.

Pray that our troops don’t kill foreign civilians.

Pray that our troops don’t rape foreign women.

Pray that our troops stop invading countries.

Pray that our troops stop occupying countries.

Pray that our troops get out of the military as soon as they can.

Pray that our troops don’t fire their weapons.

Pray that our troops don’t sexually assault military personnel.

Pray that our troops don’t frequent brothels.

Pray that our troops don’t commit suicide.

Pray that our troops stop intervening in other countries.

Pray that our troops don’t die for a lie, like those who died fighting in Iraq.

Pray that our troops don’t die in vain, like those who died fighting in Afghanistan.

Pray that our troops think about the morality of their “service.”

Pray that our troops refuse to obey immoral orders.

Pray that our troops never become troops by saying no to the military recruiter.

One does not have to be religious to see that these prayers are noticeably different from the previous ones. Think about this the next time you see a billboard or church sign that says “Pray for Our Troops.”

456905,"It’s about time that the US government’s war on drugs is dwindling, with people across the country becoming educated enough about medical marijuana to enjoy its numerous benefits. The plant was always a nemesis to Big Pharma, because they knew just how powerful it can truly be. Now, a new study published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Review reveals that people are increasingly substituting prescription medications, alcohol, and illicit drugs with cannabis.

For the study, 473 adult cannabis users were surveyed by the Centre for Addictions Research of BC. More than 86% of respondents reported giving up one or more of the substances for marijuana. Most shocking to billion dollar Pharma companies like Pfizer, Astra Zeneca, etc., would be the fact that the majority (80.6%) said they were forgoing pharmaceuticals for the non-toxic alternative. Adults under 40 were likely to forgo all three – alcohol, other illicit drugs, and pharmaceutical prescriptions for medical marijuana.

With this in mind, here are at least 5 drugs that could be replaced by medical marijuana:

1. Painkillers like Vicodin

Recent studies have made it all too clear that marijuana can have a profoundly positive effect on pain. It is also much safer to use than pills like Vicodin, which have adverse side effects and can be very addictive.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 44 Americans die each day from painkiller overdose. Though an Oxford University study said that cannabis simply makes the pain more bearable, and doesn’t really reduce it, additional scientific evidence says that cannabinoids possess pain-relieving properties, and some clinical evidence supports their medical use for patients suffering from painful conditions and chronic pain for a number of health conditions.

Marijuana is one of nature’s best natural pain killers.

2. Anti-Anxiety Medications like Xanax

Some people can’t treat anxiety with cannabis, but for others that have acute symptoms of anxiety and paranoia, it can be better than a slice of cake and birthday presents. Sativas, which are associated with cerebral highs, can sometimes induce anxiety (especially for infrequent users), indica strains of marijuana have been shown to reduce anxiety.

303082,"Conservatives emulating liberals: Jonah Goldberg of National Review writes:

Rich Lowry received a note from the father of a Marine fighting in Fallujah. In it the proud father recounted what his son had told him. Many residents of that besieged town left bedding for the Marines and soldiers, along with notes thanking them for liberating their town from the terrorists and inviting them to sleep in their homes if necessary.

Every day, I receive wonderful, uplifting, heart-wrenching e-mails from Marines and soldiers or their families with similar stories of Iraqis' expressing their gratitude and relief that the Americans are doing the hard work of democracy and decency (the latter being vastly more important than the former).

See, see  it's all worthwhile!!! Why are you opposing this wonderful war?

It's amazing how much conservatives have adopted the ways of liberals  now that the conservatives are in power.

Do you remember how, in Bill Clinton's State of the Union speeches, he would always call attention to some child or family in the audience who had benefited from some Clinton program? Clinton never mentioned the family whose taxes were increased, or whose access to market resources were reduced, or who had to pay higher prices because of the Clinton program. Just point to a few beneficiaries and make us think that the program is an unqualified success in making life better for Americans.

In the same way, conservatives point to the success stories that ""we hear so very little of from the media"" in order to make us think the Iraq war is a great endeavor  one we shouldn't be criticizing.

But, in passing on his ""success stories,"" Goldberg neglects to mention the tens of billions of dollars that have been drained from our pockets, the 1,000+ Americans who have died, the thousands of Americans who have been maimed, the tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers and resisters who have died, the tens of thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians (men, women, and children) who have died, the tens of thousands of homes that have been destroyed, and the tens of millions of people around the world who have learned to hate America because the U.S. military invaded Iraq without provocation and without any provable excuse.

Are a handful of emails and tales of gratitude worth all that?

Bill Clinton as President was a demagogue. And conservatives have learned to imitate him.

Understanding the words: And supporting the demagoguery concerning Iraq are the media (you know, the ""liberal media"" that Rush Limbaugh and other Republicans love to hold up as a threat to truth and the American way). TV reporters utter many empty statements in defense of the Bush rule-the-world policies in Iraq and elsewhere.

We really need a translating dictionary in order to understand what these empty statements are supposed to mean.

I'll do my part by contributing a few entries to start off the lexicon:

Support our troops = Don't say anything bad about the Bush war in Iraq because that might demoralize the soldiers fighting there. So just let them continue to die, rather than suggest that they might be dying in vain.

The French are weak and cowardly = They may have been right about Iraq, but when was the last time they invaded a country without provocation?

Pat Tillman (the professional football player who gave up a lucrative career to enlist, go to Iraq, and die) is an example for us all = Aren't you ashamed of yourself for ignobly focusing on earning a living for yourself and your family, rather than laying down your life for a promise that the world's problems will be solved once Iraq is completely destroyed? And don't ask me why I haven't enlisted.

America has the best-trained military in the world = I can't think of anything intelligent to say, and I have no idea how well-trained our soldiers are, but this always makes people feel good and earns me some brownie points.

We need to involve the international community, so that American troops can come home = Face it  we're never going to leave Iraq, so learn to live with it.

More emptiness in the conservative media: Incidentally, if you want to see just how empty conservative writing can be these days, read Jonah Goldberg's entire article for examples of muddled thinking in support of a bad war.

Note that he cites the U.S. Marines' ""good works"" in Fallujah as evidence that America is a ""wonderful, decent nation, brimming with millions of people who take people as they find them and do what is right because that is their character""  neglecting to mention that America is ""helping"" people in Fallujah because our government has coercively confiscated the resources from us, not because it's in the character of the American people to voluntarily give up their earnings and their lives to change a government halfway around the world.

He talks of the self-correcting nature of our way of life, saying: ""Not all criticisms are fair or accurate, and some are just plain silly. But when an idea is valid we adopt and nurture it."" But now that every excuse for invading Iraq has proven to be wrong, why aren't ""we"" correcting the mistake? Could it be because a conservative government admits of no error and cares little what has proven to be true?

And he says: ""For every politician who takes a bribe, every journalist who plagiarizes, every husband who hits his wife, every child who cheats, there are multitudes who do none of these things, . . ."" And for every President who confiscates $$2.4 trillion of our money, sends Americans to their deaths, locks up people without trials, and alienates almost the entire non-American world, there are hundreds of millions of Americans who don't steal, don't murder, don't kidnap, and don't make America look bad.

374288,"I love anything with secret compartments. From the big (secret passageways) to the small (a secret pocket in a jacket), theres just something delightful about things that are hidden away.

Which is why Ive always been drawn to book safes. They combine my love for secret compartments with my love for books. And theyre just a lot of fun.

Book safes are an age old way to stash ones treasures  the key to a safe, a private document, a flask, a gun. And you can use them while traveling to hide your ipod, back up cash, or other valuables from would-be thieves. And of course if you end up wrongfully imprisoned, they work as an excellent place to stash a rock hammer for tunneling to freedom (salvation lies within!).

Not only are book safes fun to possess, they also make a cool, unique gift. If money is tight this year, consider making a few book safes for your friends or family. The supplies you need only cost a few bucks, and each will take you about 2.5 hours or so to create. Heres a step by step rundown of how its done.

A side note: I know there will be people who cry foul at this project-arguing that cutting up a book like this is sacrilege. I personally dont understand that kind of fetishization of books. Books are not intrinsically sacred. These are generally books that no one wants and will otherwise go to waste. Youre not destroying the book, youre turning it into something else. Theres value either way.

1. Buy a Book. Head to your local used bookstore and pick one up. It doesnt have to be fancy; they always have bargain books that you can snag for just a dollar or two. Personally, I love the look of vintage books, especially for a project like this. Of course if theres a book on your shelf that youre not fond of and wouldnt mind hacking up, all the better.

There are a few things to keep in mind when selecting a book. First, consider what youll want to hide in it and how much time youre willing to put into making it. Thick books will allow you to make a deeper cavity, but carving out that cavity will require more time. A thin book will hold less treasure, but necessitate less cutting time.

Second, choose a book that will fit in on your shelf. If youve got a shelf full of new mystery paperbacks, a large vintage medical textbook will look suspicious and out of place.

Finally, consider picking a book that people arent likely to pull off your shelf out of curiosity. Think The Economic History of Kazakhstan instead of The Secrets of Better Sex.

But if youre giving the book safe as a gift, choose a volume that suits the personality and interests of the intended recipient. For Whom the Bell Tolls for Dad; Nancy Drew for little sis.

2. Gather Your Supplies. Youll need:

a book

box cutter

brush

puzzle glue

You can also use regular glue mixed with water. Ive seen the recommended glue/water ratio as 80/20 or 70/30. Ive havent tried it myself, so you may want to experiment to get the ideal consistency. Too much water and youll warp the pages and book.

I also recommend grabbing a ruler to mark the outline of your secret compartment and a few extra blades for your box cutter. The blades get dull quickly and rotating and replacing them helps the cutting step go much quicker.

3. Mark off a few pages in the front. You dont want to start carving out the secret compartment on the very first page. Leave a few pages in the front untouched, so the compartment is covered and the book looks normal when initially opened.

4. Wrap the cover with plastic bags. To keep glue off of the cover, wrap it with plastic bags. Stick one in-between the pages you marked off in the front and wrap it around the front cover. Then wrap another bag around the back cover.

224176,"For those of us who recognize the complicity of both Republicans and Democrats in our economic calamity, it has been satisfying to see the party establishments of each pummeled this election season. But as far as averting the currency crisis I describe in The Dollar Meltdown, the gold market says it’s too little, too late.

It’s no surprise that politicians hear only what they want to hear, but the Democrats take a new world indoor record for tone-deafness into the election. As the year opened with real unemployment at double-digit levels, all the President and the Democrat establishment could think about was passing Obamacare. They may be proud that they stayed on message, never mind that for most people a health care plan starts with a job and some savings.

With polls suggesting Republicans are set to re-take the House, it looks like the Democrats have a glass jaw to go along with that tin ear. And while scattered tea party victories gave the Republican establishment the thrashing it so richly deserved, the bad news is that none of it matters to our financial prospects. At least that’s the message from the gold market.

Who can disagree? Unless you think that Republicans will want to go into the next election cycle having taken on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other entitlements, there is not much hope that they will do anything meaningful about fiscal policy. Announced on September 23, the Republican Pledge to America promised to save ""at least $$100 billion in the first year alone."" $$100 billion a year? They can’t be serious. By the end of September, just a week later, the federal debt had already grown by another $$100 billion. Of course Republicans will tinker with the hated Obamacare just enough to deliver up some form of Boehner-care. Sorry, but the chance to earn lobbyist affection and future campaign contributions trumps any thoughts about simply facing up to federal insolvency and getting government out of health care.

Some real money could be saved rolling back the American empire. Congressman Ron Paul and others calculate total war and foreign spending at about $$1 trillion a year. In this context, a return of the Republicans reminds us of Talleyrand’s comment on the Bourbon dynasty that returned to the throne of France after the abdication of Napoleon: They ""had learned nothing and forgotten nothing.” Republicans seemed to have learned nothing and forgotten everything. Betraying a hubris not seen since Bush set off to ""rid the world of evil,"" the pledge from November’s likely winners includes ""bringing certainty to an uncertain world."" Republicans do take their military Keynesianism seriously. Just months ago Republican congressmen came together to support President Obama’s surge in Afghanistan with a $$59 billion emergency spending bill. Now they are campaigning about a ""robust defense,"" one category of spending that even the new members from the tea parties aren’t inclined to resist.

On the monetary front, Federal Reserve officials, having forgotten at least the French Revolution and probably the 1970’s as well, are counting on inflation to kick start economic growth. Money printing is the Fed’s old-time religion, but at least they are going to the trouble of bottling it under new names: liquidity operations, deficit accommodating, and quantitative easing. When chairman Bernanke said something euphemistic last week about ""additional purchases,"" gold shot up again, joined by silver and oil. And the dollar moved decisively lower. It’s now down 12 percent since June, resuming its long-term slide. Markets are said to be pretty good at discounting future events. Haven’t they heard that the fiscal conservatives will re-take Washington?

It is clear that the rest of the world is similarly unimpressed by Fed euphemisms or the dollar’s prospects, no matter who wins. Like the picnic ramada at the park where people take cover for a while when it begins to rain, investors take cover with the dollar briefly during a crisis. They did so in the 2008 mortgage meltdown and again during the Euro debt crisis. But like a ramada, nobody wants to live there. Or wait out a really bad storm.

Where does one weather a currency crisis? Take a look around. Reuters reported this week on a Swiss private banker who handles clients with at least $$50 million to invest that they are buying gold, sometimes by the ton, and moving it out of the financial system. According to the Financial Times, JPMorgan, having recently built a vault in Singapore, has reopened an underground gold vault in New York, while Deutsche Bank and Barclays may be opening new vaults in London. India illustrates the trend: investment demand in India has grown to 92.5 tons in the first six months of this year, compared to 25.4 tons a year earlier; this time last year India’s central bank lightened its dollar reserves substantially, taking down 200 tons of gold in one move. They aren’t alone. Central banks around the world, long net sellers of gold reserves, have become buyers, among them China and Russia. Gold keeps making new all-time highs. And it doesn’t seem to care about the Republican’s prospects this fall.

After the tumultuous years of the Great Recession, a battered people may wish that 2011 will bring a return to kinder, gentler times. But that is not what we are predicting. Instead, the fruits of government and institutional action — and inaction — on many fronts will ripen in unplanned-for fashions.

Trends we have previously identified, and that have been brewing for some time, will reach maturity in 2011, impacting just about everyone in the world.

1. Wake-Up Call In 2011, the people of all nations will fully recognize how grave economic conditions have become, how ineffectual and self-serving the so-called solutions have been, and how dire the consequences will be. Having become convinced of the inability of leaders and know-it-all ""arbiters of everything"" to fulfill their promises, the people will do more than just question authority, they will defy authority. The seeds of revolution will be sown….

2. Crack-Up 2011 Among our Top Trends for last year was the ""Crash of 2010."" What happened? The stock market didn't crash. We know. We made it clear in our Autumn Trends Journal that we were not forecasting a stock market crash — the equity markets were no longer a legitimate indicator of recovery or the real state of the economy. Yet the reliable indicators (employment numbers, the real estate market, currency pressures, sovereign debt problems) all bordered between crisis and disaster. In 2011, with the arsenal of schemes to prop them up depleted, we predict ""Crack-Up 2011"": teetering economies will collapse, currency wars will ensue, trade barriers will be erected, economic unions will splinter, and the onset of the ""Greatest Depression"" will be recognized by everyone….

3. Screw the People As times get even tougher and people get even poorer, the ""authorities"" will intensify their efforts to extract the funds needed to meet fiscal obligations. While there will be variations on the theme, the governments' song will be the same: cut what you give, raise what you take.

4. Crime Waves No job + no money + compounding debt = high stress, strained relations, short fuses. In 2011, with the fuse lit, it will be prime time for Crime Time. When people lose everything and they have nothing left to lose, they lose it. Hardship-driven crimes will be committed across the socioeconomic spectrum by legions of the on-the-edge desperate who will do whatever they must to keep a roof over their heads and put food on the table….

5. Crackdown on Liberty As crime rates rise, so will the voices demanding a crackdown. A national crusade to ""Get Tough on Crime"" will be waged against the citizenry. And just as in the ""War on Terror,"" where ""suspected terrorists"" are killed before proven guilty or jailed without trial, in the ""War on Crime"" everyone is a suspect until proven innocent….

6. Alternative Energy In laboratories and workshops unnoticed by mainstream analysts, scientific visionaries and entrepreneurs are forging a new physics incorporating principles once thought impossible, working to create devices that liberate more energy than they consume. What are they, and how long will it be before they can be brought to market? Shrewd investors will ignore the ""can't be done"" skepticism, and examine the newly emerging energy trend opportunities that will come of age in 2011….

7. Journalism 2.0 Though the trend has been in the making since the dawn of the Internet Revolution, 2011 will mark the year that new methods of news and information distribution will render the 20th century model obsolete. With its unparalleled reach across borders and language barriers, ""Journalism 2.0"" has the potential to influence and educate citizens in a way that governments and corporate media moguls would never permit. Of the hundreds of trends we have forecast over three decades, few have the possibility of such far-reaching effects….

8. Cyberwars Just a decade ago, when the digital age was blooming and hackers were looked upon as annoying geeks, we forecast that the intrinsic fragility of the Internet and the vulnerability of the data it carried made it ripe for cyber-crime and cyber-warfare to flourish. In 2010, every major government acknowledged that Cyberwar was a clear and present danger and, in fact, had already begun. The demonstrable effects of Cyberwar and its companion, Cybercrime, are already significant — and will come of age in 2011. Equally disruptive will be the harsh measures taken by global governments to control free access to the web, identify its users, and literally shut down computers that it considers a threat to national security….

9. Youth of the World Unite University degrees in hand yet out of work, in debt and with no prospects on the horizon, feeling betrayed and angry, forced to live back at home, young adults and 20-somethings are mad as hell, and they're not going to take it anymore. Filled with vigor, rife with passion, but not mature enough to control their impulses, the confrontations they engage in will often escalate disproportionately. Government efforts to exert control and return the youth to quiet complacency will be ham-fisted and ineffectual. The Revolution will be televised … blogged, YouTubed, Twittered and….

10. End of The World! The closer we get to 2012, the louder the calls will be that the ""End is Near!"" There have always been sects, at any time in history, that saw signs and portents proving the end of the world was imminent. But 2012 seems to hold a special meaning across a wide segment of ""End-time"" believers. Among the Armageddonites, the actual end of the world and annihilation of the Earth in 2012 is a matter of certainty. Even the rational and informed that carefully follow the news of never-ending global crises, may sometimes feel the world is in a perilous state. Both streams of thought are leading many to reevaluate their chances for personal survival, be it in heaven or on earth….

DIGG THIS

OK, I

admit it: I tend

to be early. The idea of private money — often referred

to as ""competing

currencies"" — has always fascinated

me. I persuaded Jim

Michaels, the late, great editor of Forbes Magazine,

to let me translate the little-known academic literature into

journalese in this article, which he published under the title

Do You Want To Be Paid In Rockefellers? In Wristons? Or How

About A Hayek? almost (ahem!) exactly twenty years ago. (May

30, 1988). The Great Inflation of the 1970s was then still a live

memory. For some years, my account was regularly assigned in college

courses. Now, GOP Presidential candidate Ron

Paul seems to have single-handedly revived

the issue with his relentless criticisms of the Federal Reserve.

(Click here for Google web

search). I still think it's going to happen — just as there will

eventually

be an immigration cut-off.

The Federal

Reserve System will be 75

years old in December. A small but growing band of academic

economists proposes a special sort of birthday celebration: The

Fed, they say, should be abolished.

Abolished?

The sole bulwark we have against runaway inflation and fiscal irresponsibility?

Most people

can’t imagine life without a currency-issuing central bank, although

in fact the Fed is younger than one of its most relentless critics,

Nobel laureate Milton

Friedman, still going strong at 76 [R.

I. P. 19122006] and hard at work at California’s Hoover

Institution.

The Fed allegedly

manages the country’s money supply in order to prevent such economic

disturbances as inflation, deflation and depression. But it is a

matter of record that, since the Fed arrived, economic disturbances

have been more severe than previously — notably the Great

Depression of 1929 and the Great Inflation of the Seventies.

In the process, the purchasing power of the dollar has almost completely

eroded. Even now, inflation is still gnawing away at around 4% a

year, compared with a mere 3.3% when President Richard Nixon first

imposed wage and price controls in 1971.

Central banking

distresses some. They argue that, far from preventing these disturbances,

central banking may exacerbate them. The Fed has been accused of

being

too tight in the 1930s and too loose in the 1970s and of innumerable

lesser errors. After bitter debate, most economists have come to

accept at least a part of this critique.

For years,

Milton Friedman has advocated doing away with some of the Fed’s

flexibility by forcing it to expand the money supply only at a fixed

annual rate approximating the long-run growth of the economy. The

Fed’s new critics, however, go further. They think the government

should be out of the money business altogether. They argue that

money could and should be provided competitively by the private

sector — just like baked beans, business magazines or any other

goods.

What? Money

is money, isn’t it? How can you have different kinds of money in

the same economy?

The idea of

Citibank and Chase Manhattan issuing their own money may indeed

seem mind-boggling. What would their currencies be called — Wristons

and Rockefellers?

But the truth is that there have been several episodes of private,

competing monies in world economic history, including in the U.S.

Recent research is suggesting they worked much better than had been

thought.

Meanwhile,

financial deregulations at home and floating exchanges rates abroad

are creating an environment in which elements of a competitive system

are already emerging — without the permission of professors or politicians.

In his forthcoming book, Free

Banking and Monetary Reform, former Manhattan Institute

economist David

Glasner calls this phenomenon “the competitive breakthrough”

that might eventually lead to the complete privatization of

money.

Government

money monopolies were effectively universal by the early 20th century.

Even free market economists, with few exceptions, took them for

granted. But these monopolies became much easier to question after

Friedrich A. Hayek, who received the Nobel Prize for Economics in

1974, published his Denationalization

of Money in 1976 and expanded upon it in 1978.

Hayek announced

that, on reflection, he no longer thought government money monopolies

were either necessary or desirable, given their record of inflation.

Instead, private institutions such as banks should be allowed to

issue their own monies, denominated as they wished.

Conventional

wisdom had assumed that a profit-seeking bank would immediately

print too much money. But Hayek pointed out that this course would

be self-defeating. If a bank over-issued its currency, causing it

to depreciate, people wouldn’t want to accept or hold it, preferring

that of more conservative banks. The offending bank’s currency would

go to a discount and, in short order, the bank would have to curb

its enthusiasm. Competition, Hayek said, would do a better job of

compelling private institutions to maintain their money’s value

than politics had with public institutions like the Fed.

Maybe — but

let’s be practical. How would I buy my groceries? Suppose the prices

were marked in Rockefellers and all I had were Wristons? Suppose

I’m a New Yorker

in San

Francisco? San Franciscans might prefer BankAmericas.

What good would my Wristons be? How could a merchant function if

his customers kept coming in with different kinds of currencies?

How could a businessman keep his books?

The answer

to these interesting questions depends partly on which of the several

different proposals for privatizing money is under discussion. Hayek’s

version is particularly radical. In most historical

episodes of private money, banks issued their own notes but

denominated them in the national unit of account — the dollar, the

pound. These notes usually exchanged at par and would be discounted

only as a last resort in specific circumstances, such as overissue.

But more generally

it is clear from the response of merchants in border zones like

Tijuana or Toronto, and from inflation-racked countries like Israel

or Argentina that are evolving a de facto U.S. dollar standard,

the costs of handling parallel currencies can easily be exceeded

by the benefits. Computers and hand-held calculators reduce the

confusion, just as they have helped business to handle international

floating exchange rates.

The fact is

that free markets don’t produce chaos. Efficiency will probably

dictate that just a few kinds of monies, perhaps only one, will

become universally accepted — exactly as the international computer

industry has spontaneously evolved standard operating systems.

To understand

Hayek’s proposal and the whole competing currencies concept, you

have to think about the nature of money. Most laymen, and some economists,

assume that money is a collective convenience requiring government

to organize, like national defense. But the historical evidence

seems to be that in reality money developed all by itself. Merchants

just agreed upon common stores of value and mediums of exchange

because they found using them more efficient than barter — an example

of what Hayek calls “spontaneous order.”

Coins are traditionally

supposed to have been invented in the 7th century B.C. by the Lydians,

whose King Croesus became a legend for his wealth. But significantly,

David Glasner reports, the earliest surviving coins appear to have

been privately issued. The Lydian royal minting monopoly was only

later imposed — by another king for whom the Greeks invented the

word “tyrant.”

Recent observations

have tended to confirm the private origins of money. In one famous

case, cigarettes spontaneously evolved as the medium of exchange

in a World War II prisoner

of war camp. In much of Europe after WWII, U.S. nylon stockings

were a kind of sexual currency.

Whether or

not governments were needed in the money business, however, they

undeniably found getting into it an irresistible source of revenue

and power, particularly in time of war or national emergency. Minting

coins was easy and profitable. Most convenient of all for a spendthrift

king, the coins could be debased — reissued with the same face value

but a lesser amount of precious metal — or actually clipped of some

of their gold and recirculated. Later, when money developed into

a claim on some other asset rather than being intrinsically valuable

in itself, governments discovered that they could simply overissue

it.

Of course,

all this would eventually result in too much money chasing too few

goods and rising prices — a process still going on merrily today.

But that’s in the long run. And in the meantime, monkeying about

with money produced interesting spasms in the economy that could

be very useful politically — for example, to influence elections.

Market forces

can be damned but not destroyed. By the Middle Ages, even governments

that monopolized money found themselves confronted with a burgeoning

banking industry that was being summoned into existence by the growth

of trade.

Banks not only

accepted deposits of money from customers, on which they paid interest,

but also made loans to other customers, on which they charged interest.

A loan was made by a bookkeeping entry that created a deposit upon

which this new debtor could draw. These new banks were able to incur

multiple liabilities against the same hard cash, because bank IOUs

were exchanged among the public in settlement of their own affairs

and rarely presented for payment. In effect, the banks were creating

money.

Governments

tolerated this development largely because they needed to borrow

money themselves, badly. For example, the Bank of England, the ancestor

of all central banks, was first

granted its charter in 1694 because it promised to buy William

III’s government bonds and finance his wars

when Parliament would not.

Similarly

in the U.S., the 1863 National Bank Act compelled qualifying banks

to hold specified amounts of federal debt, helping to pay for the

Civil War.

So even a government’s

monopoly over the issuance of currency gives it only indirect control

over the entire money supply. In recent years in the U.S. this control

has been exerted by a straitjacket of banking regulation — much

of it dating from the New Deal and subsequently rotted away by inflation,

and by the Fed’s ability to alter the reserves that banks are required

to maintain with it, thus affecting the size of the base upon which

they can build their pyramids of credit.

But now “financial

innovation” is producing a proliferation of irritatingly hard-to-categorize

“near monies” — for example, traveler’s checks, some of whose

issuers are bound not by reserve regulations but only by their own

self-interested prudence. Thus, in a sense, American Express is

already issuing its own private money, although denominated in and

convertible into Fed-produced dollars.

Hayek’s proposal

is particularly radical because it combines a number of distinct

ideas that are already quite radical enough:

“Free

banking” — banks ought to be able to issue currency and create

deposits (conceptually the same thing), choose their own reserve

ratios and generally operate entirely without regulation.

— banks ought to be able to issue currency and create deposits (conceptually the same thing), choose their own reserve ratios and generally operate entirely without regulation. Different

denominations — privately issued currencies need not be all denominated

in the same unit: Citibank’s Wristons and Chase Manhattan’s Rockefellers

would be traded against each other in a currency market just as

the different national currencies are today.

denominations — privately issued currencies need not be all denominated in the same unit: Citibank’s Wristons and Chase Manhattan’s Rockefellers would be traded against each other in a currency market just as the different national currencies are today. Private

fiat money — these private currencies need not necessarily be

convertible into gold or any underlying commodity, but would trade

entirely on the word of the issuing bank that it would not debauch

its money.

Wouldn’t this

create chaos? Is Hayek serious?

Idea number

one, free banking, is very serious. New York University’s Lawrence

H. White has recently attracted much attention with his book Free

Banking in Britain, a documentation and formal analysis

of the system’s smooth working over a 128-year period in Scotland.

Scottish free banking was suppressed in 1844, not because it didn’t

work, but in the course of legislation aimed at difficulties in

the very different English banking system.

But didn’t

this cause chaos in the U.S.? What about the wildcat banks?

That bit of

history is far from settled. Free banking briefly flourished under

state charters in the U.S. from 1837 to the Civil War. “Wildcat

banks” were accused of locating out in the frontier forests,

with the wildcats, so that their notes could not easily be presented

for redemption. But recent studies suggest that these problems have

been much exaggerated. And most of them, it is argued, were caused

by interfering state governments and inadequate enforcement of laws

against fraud.

In both Scotland

and the U.S. the private money thus issued was denominated in the

national monetary unit and was theoretically interchangeable and

redeemable into gold. In the U.S., unlike in Scotland, national

branch banking was not allowed, so notes issued by unknown faraway

banks, as well as those that were suspect for other reasons, sometimes

traded at a discount. This was not, however, an impossible inconvenience:

Bill brokers sprang up to act as middlemen. It would be even less

of a problem in these days of instant communications — and, above

all, if nationwide branch banking were allowed.

Still, the

wildcat banks left their clawmarks on the U.S. economics profession.

Many economists concluded that private banks had a theoretical incentive

to behave badly: They would produce money until its value had been

driven down to its cost of production, which is essentially zero.

This would cause a price explosion — severe inflation.

David

Glasner, however, rebuts this argument by pointing out that

a bank can make profits only to the extent that the public will

hold its money. Otherwise it will be driven into insolvency by adverse

clearings with its competitors as the public converts out of its

money and into their money. If people trust Wristons more than Rockefellers,

Chase would have to either mend its ways or be driven out of business,

and vice versa. Thus, for a bank like Chase Manhattan, the key question

would be not the cost of physically creating Rockefellers but of

keeping them in circulation. Chase’s “cost of production”

would be the resources it expended in maintaining sufficient balances

of whatever was necessary in order to convince its customers that

their Rockefellers could be redeemed whenever they wanted.

But doesn’t

bad money drive out good?

Everyone has

heard of Gresham’s

law, but practically no one understands it. Queen Elizabeth

I’s financial adviser was talking

about a situation where two monies exchange at a rate fixed

by law — for example, if both are legal tender and must be accepted

in discharge of debt. Under these circumstances, people will try

to pass on the “bad” money — the money whose value is suspect,

either because of debasement or overissue — and hoard the money

that’s “good."" But if the rate of exchange between the

monies is free to fluctuate, it is the debauched currency that will

depreciate and be driven out.

Well, who

would be the lender of last resort — as the Fed can be after disasters

such as Oct.

19 last year or the 1970

Penn Central bankruptcy?

Nobody. A free

banking system, its advocates insist, pointing to Scotland, is not

inherently unstable. The celebrated 19th-century banking “panics”

were relatively brief and self-correcting compared with the Great

Depression, with the sound banks leading reserves to rescue unsound

ones out of their own interest in preventing general collapse, as

J.P. Morgan did in the panic

of 1907. In Scotland, banks competed for the customers of failed

banks by accepting their notes at par.

In fact, private

money proponents think the Fed’s activities as a lender of last

resort, and the New Deal’s deposit insurance programs, have actually

made the U.S. banking system’s problems worse. They have encouraged

bankers to take risks, knowing that the feds would bail them out,

and thus in effect subsidized imprudent banking. Ask

anyone in Texas.

The advocates

of private monies are still arguing among themselves about other

aspects of the scheme, including Hayek’s idea number two (different

denominations) and idea number three (private fiat money). Lawrence

H. White, for example, thinks that, as in Scotland, all monies should

be denominated in the same unit, albeit visually distinguishable

so that they could trade at a discount if necessary. And he predicts

that the emerging successful money would probably turn out to be

one offering convertibility into gold or silver.

But these disputes

are not conducted with the usual academic acerbity. This is because

all private-money advocates agree that such questions can really

be settled only by allowing competition to begin. Then the free

market, to employ a key Hayekian concept, will search out the best

solution.

The privatization

of money has important macroeconomic implications. It offers, according

to its advocates, a way out of the current grand impasse of monetary

policy.

For most of

its existence, the Fed has focused on interest rates, the price

of credit, assuming that the amount of money it was supplying to

the economy was less important. But interest rates are affected

by many factors, and the Fed often ended up supplying so much money

that the resulting inflation could not be ignored.

But by the

time the Fed finally admitted to the importance of the money supply,

in the early 1980s, it turned out that the demand for money — its

“velocity of circulation” — was jumping about unpredictably,

too. Thus, judged by the usual measures, the Fed supplied massive

quantities of money to the economy after 1982. But, contrary to

what Friedman and like-minded monetarists predicted, it did not

boil off into inflation. The velocity simply slowed.

So now the

Fed appears to be flying blind, following neither a price rule nor

a quantity rule, responding to ad hoc considerations such as the

beliefs of the Fed chairman or whatever exchange rate influential

politicians happen to feel would be convenient for the dollar.

Monetary policy

would not be a problem if banks issued their own monies; it would

cease to exist. Banks would automatically extend credit to the extent

that they and their customers agree it is economically productive.

If business conditions deteriorated, loans would be liquidated,

liabilities written down to match, and the banks’ balance sheets

would shrink. Thus the quantity of money demanded by the economy

would be automatically supplied by the market, just as it now supplies

the appropriate number of automobiles. (Imagine the mess if an outfit

like the Fed were to control auto production, based on its best

guesses of what demand ought to be.)

Occasionally,

of course, banks and customers would make mistakes. But this should

be no more disruptive than a mistake in any other business. Auto

factories do overproduce. So do builders of office buildings. But

the economy adjusts.

A much-loved

answer to the mystery of monetary policy is to link the dollar in

some way to gold. But gold standard advocates have always had a

problem with gold’s moderate but real fluctuations in price, which

would inflict involuntary deflations and inflations upon the economy.

Competing currencies would tend to solve this problem. Joe

Cobb, senior economist for the U.S. Congress’ Joint Economic

committee, believes that a private money convertible into gold would

eventually become dominant. “But with free banking, other types

of money would come in at the margin if there were too little or

too much gold-backed money,” Cobb says. Silver-backed, maybe,

or oil-backed. These monies would either supplement the gold-backed

currency (if the gold price had risen, causing deflation) or displace

it (if the gold price had fallen, causing inflation).

Recently, the

young economists in the private-money subculture have been electrified

by hints that the leader of the monetarist school, Milton Friedman

himself, is being converted. In 1986 Friedman coauthored a paper

significantly softening his view that governments necessarily have

a role in money. Even more significantly, he has abandoned his long-held

position that the Fed should aim for a fixed rate of growth in the

monetary aggregates. Now he argues that the monetary base — Fed

deposits plus currency — should be frozen and complete free banking

be allowed to pyramid upon this reserve base.

This looks

like a revised monetary rule, but in fact it isn’t. Under Friedman’s

new proposal the free market, rather than the Fed, would dictate

the size of the money supply-based on the banks’ feel for the legitimate

demand for money.

Friedman stoutly

denies that his new proposal has anything to do with the volatile

velocities of the 1980s, which he blames on Fed policy. Instead,

he says he is now convinced that central bankers will never accept

moderate restraint, so he proposes to eliminate their power. However,

he agrees that under free banking the troublesome issue of velocity

would be neatly bypassed.

The proponents

of private money take Friedman’s shift as confirmation that their

position is just the logical extension of market principles. “Once

the question is put, there’s only one answer,” says the University

of Sheffield’s Kevin Dowd, whose book The

State and the Monetary System is being published by the

Vancouver-based Fraser

Institute.

Milton Friedman

has an estimate of the chances of money being denationalized: “Zero.”

But then, he recalls, for years economists were derided for arguing

about the feasibility of floating exchange rates. Then suddenly

the idea became reality. So, maybe the chances are better than zero.

The first victory

of the competing currency school may well be negative. By stressing

the fundamental flaws of central banking, they may help derail the

diametrically opposed proposal: to develop one world currency centrally

managed by the International Monetary Fund. This idea was the subject

of a recent cover story in the Economist magazine, and a

version of it has recently been advocated by Harvard

economist and former Carter

Administration official Richard Cooper. The single-currency

proposal appalls the private-money people, since it would mean an

immensely powerful world central bank, able to manipulate its money

without the minimal discipline existing now because investors can

flee into other currencies. The single-currency proposal, says Lawrence

H. White, would be “suicide after prolonged self-torture.”

It’s even

possible that competing currencies may come into existence on their

own. Richard W. Rahn,

chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, has actually

sketched out a proposal to launch a private currency convertible

into commodities or government currencies under prevailing laws.

He suggests using commodity futures markets to lower operating costs,

and overseas tax havens to avoid the tax problems preventing wider

use of the 1977 “gold clause” legislation that made contracts

based on gold legally enforceable. “Private money is not just

an abstract idea, but an idea whose time has come,” Rahn says.

“It’s technologically and legally feasible.”

Meanwhile,

a small network of economists attracted by competing currencies

is quietly establishing itself. Books and articles are being published,

sympathizers located (including outposts in Britain, France and

Germany) and eminent authorities intrigued. “It’s an intellectually

very respectable idea,” says Sir

Alan Walters of Johns Hopkins University, a leading monetarist

and formerly economic adviser to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

“I think free banking could work quite well.”

But seriously:

Can a handful of thinkers change the world?

Strange things

happen in the idea business. When Adam Smith (who did not regard

money as necessarily a government function) wrote The

Wealth of Nations in 1776, he commented

that to expect free trade to be established in Britain was “as

absurd as to expect that an Oceana or Utopia should be established

in it.” But his ideas prevailed in spite of the odds against

them, and some 90

years later not one British tariff was left.

“Hands up, don’t shoot” has become the rally cry of protesters. Even President Barack Obama weighed in. “We should comfort each other and talk with one another in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds.”

The summer edition of the Trends Journal, in an analysis by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Police Violence Against The Public Soars, outlined numerous incidents in which police officers showed no restraint in engaging citizens in the routine performance of their duties.

“In Miami, 23 police officers fired 377 bullets, literally blowing away two men trapped inside a wrecked car,” we reported in the Trends Journal. “The police were under no threat whatsoever… In Cornelia, Georgia, a SWAT team made a no-knock entry at 3 a.m. and threw a concussion grenade into a baby’s crib. The grenade blew up in the baby’s face, leaving him disfigured, unable to breathe without a ventilator… According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the raid produced no drugs, no weapons, no bundles of cash, and no suspected drug dealer. It was just another of the thousands of mistakes routinely made by SWAT goons who put American citizens at risk every time they break unannounced into a home.”

Want a more recent example? In Staten Island this summer, the attempted arrest of a man being accused of illegally selling cigarettes resulted in his death after a police office apparently put him in a choke-hold. It was yet another horrifying example of a senseless death at the hands of those entrusted to protect us.

We forecast this trend would intensify and it is doing just that. And with no credible, objective national mechanism to track these incidents, it’s virtually impossible to fully understand the depth of the issue.

Under the guise of keeping us safe from terrorism, far too many police departments are fulfilling our dire forecast (Cops Gone Wild – Trendpost): “… we repeatedly warned that the sheer scope of military might now in the hands of police departments across the country would embolden abuses not only in high-profile circumstances, but in generally innocuous circumstances, pitting innocent citizens against trigger-happy police thugs.

“Make no mistake about it, the line between soldier and cop is disappearing — and disappearing fast. Police and military are quickly becoming the same.”

When people in Washington start creating fancy new phrases, instead of using plain English, you know they are doing something they don’t want us to understand.

It was an act of war when we started bombing Libya. But the administration chose to call it “kinetic military action.” When the Federal Reserve System started creating hundreds of billions of dollars out of thin air, they called it “quantitative easing” of the money supply.

When that didn’t work, they created more money and called it “quantitative easing 2” or “QE2,” instead of saying: “We are going to print more dollars — and hope it works this time.” But there is already plenty of money sitting around idle in banks and businesses.

The policies of this administration make it risky to lend money, with Washington politicians coming up with one reason after another why borrowers shouldn’t have to pay it back when it is due, or perhaps not pay it all back at all. That’s called “loan modification” or various other fancy names for welching on debts. Is it surprising that lenders have become reluctant to lend?

Private businesses have amassed record amounts of cash, which they could use to hire more people — if this administration were not generating vast amounts of uncertainty about what the costs are going to be for ObamaCare, among other unpredictable employer costs, from a government heedless or hostile toward business.

As a result, it is often cheaper or less risky for employers to work the existing employees overtime, or to hire temporary workers, who are not eligible for employee benefits. But lack of money is not the problem.

Those who are true believers in the old-time Keynesian economic religion will always say that the only reason creating more money hasn’t worked is because there has not yet been enough money created. To them, if QE2 hasn’t worked, then we need QE3. And if that doesn’t work, then we will need QE4, etc.

Like most of the mistakes being made in Washington today, this dogmatic faith in government spending is something that has been tried before — and failed before.

Henry Morgenthau, Secretary of the Treasury under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, said confidentially to fellow Democrats in 1939: “We have tried spending money. We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work.”

As for the Federal Reserve today, a headline in the Wall Street Journal of April 25th said, “Fed Searches for Next Step.”

That is a big part of the problem. It is not politically possible for either the Federal Reserve or the Obama administration to leave the economy alone and let it recover on its own.

Both are under pressure to “do something.” If one thing doesn’t work, then they have to try something else. And if that doesn’t work, they have to come up with yet another gimmick.

All this constant experimentation by the government makes it more risky for investors to invest or employers to employ, when neither of them knows when the government’s rules of the game are going to change again. Whatever the merits or demerits of particular government policies, the uncertainty that such ever-changing policies generate can paralyze an economy today, just as it did back in the days of FDR.

The idea that the federal government has to step in whenever there is a downturn in the economy is an economic dogma that ignores much of the history of the United States.

During the first hundred years of the United States, there was no Federal Reserve. During the first one hundred and fifty years, the federal government did not engage in massive intervention when the economy turned down.

No economic downturn in all those years ever lasted as long as the Great Depression of the 1930s, when both the Federal Reserve and the administrations of Hoover and of FDR intervened.

The myth that has come down to us says that the government had to intervene when there was mass unemployment in the 1930s. But the hard data show that there was no mass unemployment until after the federal government intervened. Yet, once having intervened, it was politically impossible to stop and let the economy recover on its own. That was the fundamental problem then — and now.

He has developed an eleven point plan to hoist the administration back up onto a war footing with Russia. Never let a good crisis go to waste.

McCain would start of course with money. Not his own but ours. His first point is to pass the one billion dollar loan guarantee to Ukraine currently stalled in the Senate. Just an appetizer, as he foresees much more US money “to strengthen the IMF’s ability to be a stronger partner to Ukraine.”

Then McCain would have NATO come in to Ukraine to “rebuild” the Ukrainian military, presumably to prepare it to attack Russia and presumably we would have to pay for this as well.

NATO would then be expected to be more attuned to the anti-Russian impulses of its new members in the Baltics and eastern Europe, or as Russia expert Eric Kraus puts it, the Baltic and Polish tail wagging the dog. Or as McCain puts it: “Enhance NATO’s force presence, security cooperation, and military exercises, especially in Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic countries.”

Most significantly, McCain’s plan is to bring into NATO as many countries as possible as quickly as possible so that the possibility that the US will not go to war at the behest of Georgia or some other chihuahua nation in the region will be legally impossible. Every little corner of the former Soviet world who pokes Russia should have the instant backing of the entire US nuclear arsenal.

It is moral hazard on methamphetamine.

Says McCain, we must:

Work within NATO to take all necessary steps that can prepare for the expansion of the alliance to include countries such as Georgia and Montenegro as soon as possible.

McCain is working overtime to push the US to war with Russia over an insignificant piece of land thousands of miles away. Expect at least a 15 point plan tomorrow.

WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH MITT ROMNEY IS A CONSERVATIVE

~ An updated version of the Ministry of Truth's slogan from George Orwell's 1984

The media pundits and the talk radio hosts and their callers have been bending over backwards to label Willard Mitt Romney a ""conservative."" They have been desperately trying to fit their ideal of a conservative into Romney like fitting a piece into a puzzle that will never fit — not without a pair of scissors, that is. It is truly Orwellian, this thing with calling a far-left socialist a ""conservative."" They might as well call Barack Obama a ""conservative.""

In addition to that, many people are trying to find a Republican who is ""electable,"" someone who can beat Obama in the November, 2012 election. But if Romney does become the Republican nominee and then wins the election, then what? Given that he is bought and paid for by Wall Street, do you really believe that Romney will do anything to fix the underlying causes of our current economic depression (central banking, the Fed, the collusions between Wall Street and the U.S. government, the government's expansionist empire abroad and deficit spending and ever-increasing debt)? Given what a tax-raiser he was as governor, do you really believe Romney will not be exactly like George H.W. Bush and Bush Jr. in caving like a jellyfish to the Capitol Hill big spenders?

As governor of Taxachusetts, Romney raised corporate taxes, and he also raised hundreds of millions of dollars in higher fees, on guns, marriages, property transfers, you name it. And ""Massachusetts conservative"" Willard Romney, who went on record in 2002 opposing getting rid of the state income tax, dramatically increased the state budget, according to Center for Small Government President Carla Howell. Any income tax, whether it be federal, state or city, is so dreadfully invasive of property rights, privacy and contracts, and so violating of freedom, who in his right mind could possibly oppose getting rid of it?

And many people have been saying that they support Romney because of his business experience. He had a lot of experience at his Bain Capital firm driving some companies out of business and getting rich from the early investments and tax deductions in the process. But how much of his work in the private sector was spent providing something of actual value to others? To me, given his record with Bain, it is as though they were trying to act like government bureaucrats, many of whom currently in Washington having also gotten rich off the backs of working class Americans.

Given the way he treated various businesspeople during his time with Bain, one wonders just how — in the political world — he will deal with dissenting Americans, especially those of the Tea Party movement and the Occupy movement who are extremely critical of the federal government. How will Romney handle the further expanded powers of the presidency if he is given the new powers of indefinite detention of anyone he chooses, without due process?

Speaking of security issues, Romney is also unwilling to oppose cutting ""defense"" spending. In fact, he wants to increase spending on the already bloated military-security-industrial-complex. Romney supports the Big Government foreign interventionism of the military central planners in Washington, and wants to expand the intrusions and aggressions abroad.

While some people in New Hampshire might disagree with me on this, true conservatives oppose any governmental interventionism, foreign or domestic. Unfortunately, so many people have been taken in by the government propagandists who have been insisting that the wars and expanded military bureaucracy of the past ten years had been necessary, and some still believe it despite the wars' utter failures, destruction, counter-productiveness, waste of lives and bankrupting costs.

Many people do not want to believe that terrorism of the 1990s and 2000s were direct results of the aggressions committed overseas by the U.S. government especially since 1990 and especially in Iraq. Some people just don't like to hear reality told to them, which is why Ron Paul got booed at those debates. But generally, the events of terrorism blowback were results of central planning.

This central planning by the government interventionists is not conservative, nor is it liberal. It is statist. (See Jacob Hornberger on libertarianism versus statism.) The statists believe in using the monopolistic, armed power of the centralized federal government not only to interfere with the lives of their own people domestically, but with the lives of foreigners. Willard Mitt Romney aligns himself with these Bush-Cheney-Feith-Wolfowitz central planners of foreign interventionist statism and all its destruction.

Some of Americans' support for such foreign interventionism and central planning comes from this idea of American exceptionalism, which Romney has repeatedly stated should be renewed and projected across the globe. Whether people want to acknowledge it or not, American exceptionalism means that our government should have the power to intrude into and interfere with the internal affairs of foreign peoples — and militarily no less — but foreigners shouldn't have the right to place their government apparatus and military bases on our lands. This philosophy contradicts the Christian principle of ""Do unto others what one would want others to do unto you,"" and ""Don't do unto others what one would not want others to do unto you."" Such a Christian philosophy is exactly that of Ron Paul, certainly not of Willard Romney.

My own personal opinion is that, given Romney's past insincerities and flip-flopping, I don't particularly believe his sincerity in the national security debate. He seems to be pandering to the public's post-9/11 fears, and to the fear-mongering of the neoconservatives. And, just as Romney will probably have a hard time saying ""no"" to his Wall Street benefactors, so too will it be hard for him to say ""no"" to the defense contractors, the merchants of death.

In a nutshell, Romney is no conservative, nor is he a ""liberal."" Romney is a politician. In fact, he is the epitome of ""weathervane politician."" He would fit right in as a character in Orwell's novel, 1984 (and a very scary one at that).

""But, we need someone who can beat Obama in November. We can't afford to take the chance of Obama getting reelected,"" people cry. Yeah, and once your ""electable"" Willard Romney were to take the oath of office in January, 2013, he will continue the socialism, the environmentalist voodooism and the warmongering, as well as the Fed's inflationary money printing, and drive America completely into the ground like he did those businesses from his Bain Capital steering wheel.

There actually is a conservative, however, who believes that the government should only do what the Constitution says, and who actually will reduce the size, power and intrusiveness of the federal government, and restore the protection of our natural rights and civil liberties. Most readers here know who that is.

The people of New Hampshire will make a choice this week. The choice is between continuing the socialism, corporate-government cronyism and central planning which are destroying America from within and will leave us to ruin — or reason, common sense, and the restoration of the rule of law and freedom. Let's hope they choose the latter.

If people could not or did not finance new cars, new car sales would probably drop by 75 percent  and two-thirds of the currently-in-business car companies would probably be out of business.

What does this tell us?

First, the current market is an artificially created and very abnormal one  like Frankensteins monster and just as destructive. It is not a coincidence that the explosion in brands  and the geometric increase in the number of individual models sold by each brand  coincides precisely with the rise in easy credit made possible by no-cost (or next-to-no-cost) money (i.e., interest) and loans stretched out over 5-6 years.

It was not all that long ago that the typical new car loan was just three or four years.

But perhaps the most insidious aspect of the flim-flam is the way it hides the cost of government mandates and regulations from the eyes (and thoughts) of the typical American  making them seem affordable.

Or at least, we dont notice how unaffordable theyve made new cars.

Its really quite brilliant, in a Dr. Evil kind of way  like withholding. Many workers never actually have to send the government a check, because the moneys already been taken before they ever even get to touch it. Similarly, long-range financing and low interest on that long-range financing makes the bloated MSRP sticker price of the typical new car seem more manageable because the payments are broken down into monthly chunks. It is no accident that car salesmen are trained to get the buyer to focus on the monthly payment  not the actual sticker price of the car itself. They will ask, How much can you afford to pay per month  knowing that, say, $$400 goes down a lot easier than $$40,000.

Since most Americans are innumerate as well as impulsive and thoroughly conditioned Consumerists, its no hard sell to get them to sign up.

And that is what makes possible the shoving-under-the-proverbial-rug of things like the federal passive restraint mandate that gave us the now-common 4-6 (or more) air bags that every new car has and which add  according to most estimates  about $$2,000 to the bottom like cost of each and every one of those new cars. Ditto the Feds clean diesel mandates that have jacked up the sticker prices of vehicles with otherwise-efficient diesel engines by 20 percent. There is a literal laundry list of such mandates, ranging from the minor to the major  but each costs something and those costs are all folded into the price of the car.

Now, if it werent for extended-range payment plans, the cost of all this rigmarole would be much more obvious  and offensive  to consumers. More to the point, it would be obviously unaffordable.

Instead of that $$400 per month payment on the $$40,000 car  spread out over 5-6 years to ease the financial burden in the perception of the well-marinated Consumerist  said Consumerist would be staring at $$600 or maybe $$800 a month for the same vehicle, scrunched down into a three or four-year payment plan.

And that, in turn, would make it much harder for the government to continue blithely imposing its mandates  costs  onto the backs of consumers, because consumers would simply stop buying cars and the wheels of industry would cease to turn.

And we cant have that.

Thus, the pyramid scam goes on. The regulatory burdens increase and with them, the cost of the end product. Finance greases the skids by making it all seem affordable when its really not  and the Dumbos keep signing up for payment-in-perpetuity and wonder why theyre perpetually broke.

The tragedy is were still in control and could throw the proverbial switch overnight and then change  the real thing  would come. If even 20 percent of people who currently finance new car purchases on the 5-6 year plan chose instead to buy a lower-cost used car outright, with cash money, itd impose some much-needed financial discipline not just on the car industry  which supinely accepts and often loudly amens every new federal safety (and emissions) mandate proposed by non-engineer, know-nothing bloviating politicians  but it would also put a crimp on this disastrous living-beyond-our-means train-wreck-in-the-making that is modern America.

That buzzing noise means something. Now, the only reason for making a buzzing noise that I know of is because you are… a bee! And the only reason for being a bee is to make honey. And the only reason for making honey is so I can eat it. ~ from Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree

When selecting foods for your stockpile, the most budget-friendly, space-conscious way to do it is by selecting items that multitask. This criteria places honey high on your “to-buy list”. Tess Pennington of Ready Nutrition lists honey as one of the top SHTF sweeteners to store.

Honey is indeed nature’s sweetener, but don’t write it off as just a condiment. The sticky sweet substance is far more than something to stir into your tea or spread on your toast.

Since ancient times, the healing properties of honey have been documented. Some of this knowledge seems to have been forgotten (and purposely marginalized), and drug companies have replaced honey with chemical ointments, antibiotics and antivirals. (This is, as always, about money — they can’t patent honey, can they?)

Honey has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for more than 4000 years. Honey is an ingredient in 634 remedies in ancient Hindu vedic texts.

The Ebers Papyrus of ancient Egypt expounded on the medicinal properties of honey, and it is contained in nearly every ancient Egyptian remedy.

In ancient Greece, Hippocrates, the “Father of Medicine” wrote, ”Honey and pollen cause warmth, clean sores and ulcers, soften hard ulcers of lips, heal carbuncles and running sores.”

Just Because the Label Says “Honey” …

Now, you can’t go and get the ubiquitous squeezy bear full of honey at the grocery store and expect it to cure all your ills. In fact, the some of the squeezy bears don’t even contain real honey at all. Our good friends at the FDA have defined honey as “anything containing pollen.

Even with that broad definition, some of the Chinese companies have “ultrafiltered” the honey that goes into those little bears to the point that there isn’t even any pollen left.

I bet you wonder why — I did.

Ultrafiltering removes the pollen so that the source of the honey cannot be determined. Providers of cheap honey do this so that consumers cannot discover the origin. Often the cheap honey is tainted with pesticides, illegal antibiotics, and heavy metals. Some of the cheap honey is watered down with High Fructose Corn Syrup. Much of the questionable honey originates in China.

According to independent testing ordered by Food Safety News and performed by Vaughan Bryant, a professor at Texas A&M University and one of the nation's premier melissopalynologists, or investigators of pollen in honey.76% of the golden stuff sold in grocery stores as honey doesn’t contain even one little drop of pollen.

76 percent of samples bought at groceries had all the pollen removed, These were stores like TOP Food, Safeway, Giant Eagle, QFC, Kroger, Metro Market, Harris Teeter, A&P, Stop & Shop and King Soopers.

100 percent of the honey sampled from drugstores like Walgreens, Rite-Aid and CVS Pharmacy had no pollen.

77 percent of the honey sampled from big box stores like Costco, Sam's Club, Walmart, Target and H-E-B had the pollen filtered out.

u202200 percent of the honey packaged in the small individual service portions from Smucker, McDonald's and KFC had the pollen removed.

Bryant found that every one of the samples Food Safety News bought at farmers markets, co-ops and u201Cnaturalu201D stores like PCC and Trader Joe's had the full, anticipated, amount of pollen.

The FDA, despite their definition, doesn’t seem to care about the false labeling of these products. The FDA has ignored requests from Congress, beekeepers and the honey industry to develop a U.S. standard for honey. Less than 5% of honey on store shelves has been tested by the FDA for purity.

How can you be sure you are actually buying honey?

As with most products, the closer you can get to the actual source, the better off you’ll be. Short of scooping the sticky stuff directly from the hives, purchase as locally as possible, directly from beekeepers or at your favorite farmer’s market.

There are more than 300 varieties of honey sold in the US. The difference in these varieties is the source of the pollen. Buckwheat honey is reputed to have the most healing properties of any type of honey. As a general rule of thumb, the darker the honey is, the more benefits it has.

Pasteurized vs. Raw

The FDA seems more concerned that honey be pasteurized (i.e.,heat processed) than that the honey actually be honey. The problem with pasteurization is that it kills off many of the beneficial components in the honey, most particularly propolis.

…The processing of honey often removes many of the phytonutrients found in raw honey as it exists in the hive. Raw honey, for example, contains small amounts of the same resins found in propolis. Propolis, sometimes called “bee glue,” is actually a complex mixture of resins and other substances that honeybees use to seal the hive and make it safe from bacteria and other micro-organisms. Honeybees make propolis by combining plant resins with their own secretions… Other phytonutrients found both in honey and propolis have been shown to possess cancer-preventing and anti-tumor properties. These substances include caffeic acid methyl caffeate, phenylethyl caffeate, and phenylethyl dimethylcaffeate. Researchers have discovered that these substances prevent colon cancer in animals by shutting down activity of two enzymes, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and lipoxygenase. When raw honey is extensively processed and heated, the benefits of these phytonutrients are largely eliminated… (source)

Despite the important benefits of raw honey, there are some caveats.

Infants under the age of 1 should not be fed raw honey because of the risk of botulism. Their underdeveloped immune systems cannot prevent the Clostridium botulinum pores from multiplying. Botulism can cause paralysis and death.

People with bee venom allergies sometimes suffer an allergic reaction to honey. These allergic reactions can easily become life-threatening.

There is a higher risk of food poisoning when you consume raw honey vs pasteurized honey.

With the knowledge of the above warnings, I still purchase only raw honey for my household. The pros outweigh the cons for me.

The Benefits of Raw Honey

Raw honey is anti-viral, anti-bacterial, and anti-fungal, making it one of the most healing substances on earth. It is also highly nutritious. Honey is a natural multivitamin. It contains significant amounts of: B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, C, magnesium, potassium, calcium, sodium chlorine, sulphur, and phosphate.

Honey has been used historically both internally and externally for a variety of concerns:

Apply honey liberally on a wound to speed healing.

Apply honey to a rash, burn or scrape, and cover loosely.

A tsp taken 3 times per day can help prevent seasonal allergies.

A tbsp of raw honey sprinkled with cinnamon taken 3 times per day can boost the immune system and fight off a cold or sore throat.

A spoonful of honey can soothe a cough caused by a tickle or sore throat.

A couple of tablespoons of honey stirred into hot tea can lessen the symptoms of a cold or flu.

Honey mixed with equal parts coconut oil makes a wonderful skin conditioner.

Some studies say that honey can help control blood sugar fluctuations.

Raw honey increases the production of antioxidants in the bloodstream.

Recent studies proved that honey reduced overall cholesterol levels when taken daily.

Honey applied topically to a wound or incision moistens the skin and helps prevent or reduce scarring.

Recipe: Homemade Cough Syrup

I keep a honey-lemon-ginger remedy in my refrigerator all winter long. Learn more about honey as a flu symptom remedy HERE.

I always keep a jar of this homemade cough syrup in my refrigerator. It tastes so good that I don't have to ask my kids twice to take it. You can also stir a few tablespoons of the syrup into hot water for a homemade u201CNeo-Citranu201D-style hot drink without all the nasty chemicals.

Ingredients

2 lemons, scrubbed and thinly sliced

6 tbsp of grated ginger root

Honey as needed

Directions

In a glass jar, layer the lemon slices and grated ginger until the jar is full. Pour honey into the jar, using the blade of a kitchen knife to move the lemon and ginger around and make room for it. Store it in the fridge for at least 2 weeks before using it. Then, take 1-2 tsp 3 times per day, as needed, for coughs or sore throats.

Long Term Storage of Honey

The great news about buying honey for your stockpile is that it stores forever. Literally. Honey was discovered in the pyramids of Egypt — over 5000 years old — and still edible. Given that, I strongly suspect it will remain viable in your stockpile for as long as you care to store it. The only thing that will happen is that, in time, it will crystallize. You can resolve this issue by placing the jar of honey in a bowl of hot water until it returns to liquid form. However, you can also use it in its crystallized form — you can stir it into tea, spread it on hot toast, or take a spoonful of it as one of the remedies mentioned above.

Frequently heating and cooling honey can lessen its nutritional potency, so I recommend putting honey in a small jar for regular use and using the big jars just to restock your little one.

Store your honey in an airtight container in a cool, dark place.

471673,"Hot Peppers and Nuclear Weapons Are a Dangerous Combination

by Eric Margolis

Recently by Eric Margolis: Vive La France

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — This vast, pulsating city of ten million seems to have doubled in size since my last visit ten years ago. In spite of its gigantic scale and increasingly modernistic image, Seoul remains far calmer and better ordered than most of Asia's frenetic cities.

Dynamic, optimistic, high-tech South Korea is flying at Mach 9: it reminds me of Japan 25 years ago. Over 85% of Koreans are online. Textbooks are becoming ancient relics in Korean schools. The term ""offline"" denotes being behind the times, even backwards.

Meanwhile, the other 24 million Koreans in the northern part of this divided nation are in deepening trouble. Many go hungry or subsist on the verge of starvation, victims of the whims of their bizarre Communist monarchy.

In 1950, North Korea, backed by the Soviet Union and, later, China, invaded US-occupied South Korea. The shameful rout of the US 8th Army in the winter of 1950 by Chinese troops has been erased from America's collective memory. Without air dominance, the US and its allies would have been run off the Korean Peninsula.

Three years of bitter, seesaw fighting, in which over 2.5 million Korean civilians died, resulted in a stalemate.

An armistice stopped the fighting on the 38th parallel, but the two Koreas and Americans remain on hair trigger alert.

A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) bisects the peninsula: on either side, 750,000 North Korean soldiers face 500,000 South Korean, backed by 37,000 US troops and the 7th US Air Force, with the US Navy just over the horizon.

Tension on the DMZ is electric. North and South Korea troops glare at one another from fortified positions and observation posts. The world's thickest minefields and high antitank walls extend from coast to coast. On my last visit, I explored 2km-long tunnels under the DMZ secretly dug by the North Koreans.

I was warned that even pointing at the North Koreans could trigger a firefight that might lead to full-scale war. The much more reserved Japanese claim Koreans are overly excitable due to their high consumption of garlic and red peppers.

Adding a new dimension of danger, North Korea is estimated to have three plutonium nuclear devices and is developing more bombs using enriched uranium.

It is uncertain if North Korea has managed to miniaturize a nuclear warhead that can be carried on a medium or short-ranged missile. US and South Korean human intelligence about North Korea is amazingly poor. The main source of information on North Korea seems to be diplomatic gossip.

A quarter of all South Koreans live in Seoul. Large parts of the city north of the Han River lie within range of North Korea's 170mm guns and 240mm rocket batteries dug into the DMZ's granite hillsides, which are honeycombed by a veritable ant's nest of North Korean tunnels, command posts, supply depots and gun positions.

North Korea keeps threatening to turn Seoul into ""a sea of fire,"" and has hinted it might even use nuclear weapons against US bases in Japan and Okinawa if attacked by America.

Is North Korea really the dire threat that Washington claims it is? According to South Korea's right, which is dominated by militant Christian evangelicals linked to their US co-religionists and neocons, the answer is definitely yes. US neocons are particularly concerned that North Korea may supply nuclear weapons, technology or missiles to Israel's Mideast foes — hence their bitter antagonism to North Korea and attempts to block any peace deals between Washington and Pyongyang.

However, many moderate Koreans take a less alarmist view of the North. They tend to see the North rattling its cage to get food and fuel from the US, South Korea and Japan. Extortion is North Korea's principal source of hard currency. Bloodcurdling threats and invective against the US and its Asian allies is North Korea's favorite sport.

A good example: ""death to the filthy South Korean lackey-puppet-running dogs of the US imperialists!"" Old Cold Warriors like myself tingle when we hear such sorely-missed, florid Communist invective.

In spite of US warnings about North Korea's nuclear weapons, many South Korean analysts believe these arms are entirely defensive, designed only to deter any possible US nuclear attack. This strategy is working: the US has refrained from military action against North Korea. The fact that Iraq and Libya did not have nuclear weapons has not been lost on the North Koreans.

If the North fired any nuclear weapons at its neighbors, the waiting US Navy and 7th Air Force would vaporize North Korea (and much of northern South Korea as well). The North's fun-loving leaders are not suicidal. In fact, their imports of prime cognac, Bordeaux wines and cigars are up a reported 24% this year — in spite of an ungentlemanly American embargo on luxury goods for the North.

North Korea's Kim dynasty just wants to be left alone.

It appears to by now have mostly consolidate the future succession of ""Dear Leader"" Kim Jong-il's youngest son, Kim Jong-un by securing backing from the military and Communist Party — all of whose members enjoy the good life while the rest of North Koreans get skinnier and actually shrink in size.

China, always considered North Korea's ""elder brother"" in the Confucian system, is happy to keep the North as a buffer zone for its strategic Manchurian border, and free of US bases. Japan is uneager to see a competitive united Korea. Russia seems indifferent to affairs in its Pacific Far East.

South Koreans worry that having to feed and build a liberated North Korea will bankrupt them. President Lee Myung-bak recently proposed a sensible national reunification tax to begin accruing funds to rebuild the North.

However, reunification is not necessarily inevitable. Some North Koreans might initially prefer to retain a separate state under Communist Party and/or military rule, minus the quirky Kims.

Neither side in this six-decade old standoff has any interest in starting a new war. Recent clashes between North and South have been tactical political gestures, not a prelude to war — though such skirmishes do risk getting out of hand.

Last week, North Korea agreed to reopen nuclear talks with the US and its neighbors. As an old Korea-watcher, my gut tells me that North Korea is most unlikely to ever agree to scrap its nuclear life insurance policy, at least until the US signs a nonaggression pact with Pyongyang. So far, Washington has refused this basic North Korean demand.

That's the rational view. But one never really knows what the red-pepper hot Koreans may do next.

463703,"If there was no news at the Democratic National Convention, as so many pundits have pointed out, then why were there 15,000 journalists attending it?

The answer is that national political conventions are social events, and journalists don’t often get a chance to party on expense accounts. Consequently, for years there have been three to four times as many journalists at these non-news events as delegates. There is a whole lot of schmoozing and boozing going on.

The dearth of real news is illustrated by how much airtime journalists wasted on the trivial remark John Kerry’s wife made to a rude journalist. After being badgered by the guy, she smiled, said, ""Shove it,"" and walked off. That’s not even worth reporting. Everyone by now should know that Mrs. Kerry is an independent, outspoken woman who doesn’t suffer fools lightly.

My favorite put-down of a journalist was when ABC reporter John Stossel made the mistake of trying an ""ambush interview"" with a professional wrestler. He caught the guy coming out of the dressing room and asked him to admit that wrestling was fake, or words to that effect. The wrestler, who seemed in a foul mood, slapped Stossel completely off his feet and said, ""Did that feel fake to you?"" I believed the answer was no as Stossel crawled out of range on his hands and knees. He was a good-enough sport, however, to show his own beating on TV.

Let’s face it: Journalists are not popular. The last time I saw one of those lists of how the public rates people, journalists were down in the basement with undertakers and used-car salesmen. If you’re a public figure and you have to insult or strike somebody, a journalist is by far your best bet. Lawyers will sue, and athletes can usually give you a good whipping.

Someone asked me if I was afraid of physical attacks because I write a controversial column, and I said, ""No, because I’m careful not to insult nonverbal people."" I never criticize ironworkers, professional wrestlers or other people who might not be able to think of a snappy comeback. Inarticulate people are the kind of people who sometimes let their fists do their talking. For the more serious types who like to make death threats, I just remind them that I learned to shoot long before I learned to write.

Despite the lack of news, I always urge people to watch the conventions on television. If you watch C-SPAN or Public Television, you will get to hear the speeches uninterrupted, and I think that’s still a valuable thing to do in an election year. Most of the networks and cable talk-show channels keep the cameras on themselves and only occasionally let you hear a snippet of a speech. That’s a big irritant to me. We can always watch the TV vanities, but some of the people who speak at conventions are not always in the public limelight.

Since being a good communicator is an essential skill for a politician, if nothing else, you can make a judgment on that point. If you happened to watch Bill Clinton’s speech last week, you know why he was elected twice and why he could always drive Republicans crazy by stealing their ideas and articulating them better than they could. The guy’s an incorrigible rascal, but he sure knows how to talk.

It’s always best in an important election to get as much information as you can about candidates, unfiltered through journalists. I know that’s tough to do these days, but C-SPAN, the Internet and public libraries help.

It is possible for journalists to write unbiased and disinterested reports, but that style of journalism is currently out of favor. Opinion columnists, most of the TV guys and radio talk-show hosts are all paid to peddle opinions, not to do hard reporting. And, as it has been pointed out so often, opinions are like body orifices — most people have at least one.

But do vote this year for the guy you think is the better of the choices. After Florida 2000, nobody can say votes don’t count. Less than 1,000 votes put one man in the White House and kept another one out.

That could be the case in 2004, and your vote matters.

Another trace mineral I like to recommend is Terratol – which is humate, a mineral source that is plant based and easily absorbable. It contains humic and fulvic acid. Humates oxygenate the blood, help chelate heavy metals, and have some anti-viral properties.

When using nutritional supplements to make up for deficiencies in the diet, it is important to include something rich in trace minerals. Many multivitamins today include trace minerals from good sources.

Form is important. I prefer plant based supplements as opposed to ground up rocks, which cannot be utilized by the body and will result in further imbalances if used over the long term.

You cant show war as it really is on the screen, with all the blood and gore. Perhaps it would be better if you could fire real shots over the audiences head every night, you know, and have actual casualties in the theater. ~ Sam Fuller, film director and author

War is a grisly business, a horror of epic proportions. In terms of human carnage alone, wars devastation is staggering. For example, it is estimated that approximately 231 million people died worldwide during the wars of the 20th century. However, this figure does not take into account the walking wounded  both physically and psychologically  who survive war.

Eventually, war will be our undoing. As Pulitzer Prize-winning war correspondent and author Chris Hedges observes:

War is like a poison. And just as a cancer patient must at times ingest a poison to fight off a disease, so there are times in a society when we must ingest the poison of war to survive. But what we must understand is that just as the disease can kill us, so can the poison. If we don’t understand what war is, how it perverts us, how it corrupts us, how it dehumanizes us, how it ultimately invites us to our own self-annihilation, then we can become the victim of war itself.

War is one of the most heady and intoxicating, addictive enterprises ever created by humankind. It has an allure, a fascination, a draw that sweeps across national lines, ethnicity, race, religion. It has perverted, corrupted, and ultimately destroyed societies and nations across the globe. The only way to guard against it is finally to understand what it does and how pernicious it is and the myths and lies that we use to cover up the fact that, at its core, war is death.

As Hedges implies, war is entertainment. Indeed, from books to television to the internet to film, war has been a centerpiece of American entertainment culture. Yet of all the artistic mediums, film may be the most suitable forum for a discussion of war, because of its visual impact.

War movies deal in the extremes of human behavior. The best films address not only destruction on a vast scale but also plumb the depths of humanitys response to the grotesque horror of war. They present human conflict in its most bizarre conditions  where men and women caught in the perilous straits of death perform feats of noble sacrifice or dig into the dark battalions of cowardice.

War films provide viewers with a way to vicariously experience combat, but the great ones are not merely vehicles for escapism. Instead, they provide a source of inspiration, while touching upon the fundamental issues at work in wartime scenarios.

Here are 12 war films which touch on modern warfare (from the First World War onward) and run the gamut of conflicts and human emotions and center on the core issues often at work in the nasty business of war.

The Third Man (1949). Carol Reeds The Third Man, which deals primarily with the after-effects of the ravages of war, is a great film by anyones standards. Set in postwar Europe, this bleak film (written by Graham Greene) sets forth the proposition that the corruption inherent in humanity means that the ranks of war are never closed. There are many fine performances in this film, including Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten and Alida Valli.

Paths of Glory (1957). This Stanley Kubrick film is an antiwar masterpiece. The setting is 1916, when two years of trench warfare have arrived at a stalemate. And while nothing of importance is occurring in the war, thousands of lives are being lost. But the masters of war pull the puppet strings, and the blood continues to flow. This film is packed with good performances, especially from Kirk Douglas and George Macready.

The Manchurian Candidate (1962). John Frankenheimers classic focuses on the psychological effects of war and its transmutation into mind control and political assassination. All the lines of intrigue converge to form a prophetic vision of what occurred the year after the films release with the assassination of John F. Kennedy. This chilling film is well written (co-written by Frankenheimer and George Axelrod) and acted. Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury head a fine cast.

Dr. Strangelove, Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb (1964). One of the great films of all time, Stanley Kubricks Dr. Strangelove burst onto the cinematic landscape and cast a cynical eye on the entire business of war. Strange and surreal, this film is packed full of amazing images and great performances. Peter Sellers should have walked off with the Oscar for best actor (but he didnt). Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott are excellent in support.

MASH (1970). This is one of Robert Altmans best and most influential films  as can be seen in the popular spin-off television series. Everyone knows the story of this group of misfit American doctors during the Korean War. Fine performances by Donald Sutherland and Elliott Gould.

The Deer Hunter (1978). Michael Ciminos Academy Award-winning film is one of the most emotion-invoking films ever made. This story of a group of Pennsylvania steel mill workers who endure excruciating ordeals in the Vietnam War is one film that makes its point clear  war is the horror of all horrors. Robert DeNiro is fine, and Christopher Walken, who won a best supporting actor Oscar, is superb.

Apocalypse Now (1979). I consider this Francis Ford Coppolas best film. Based on Joseph Conrads novella, The Heart of Darkness, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) treks to the Cambodian jungle to assassinate renegade, manic Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando). This antiwar epic is a great visual experience with fine performances from its ensemble cast.

Platoon (1986). This is not Oliver Stones best film, but it is one helluva war movie. Set before and during the Tet Offensive of January 1968, this is a gritty view of the Vietnam War by one who served there. Indeed, when Stone is not filling the screen with explosions, he makes the jungle seem all too real  a wet place for bugs, leeches and snakes, but not for people. Fine performances by Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger.

Full Metal Jacket (1987). Stanley Kubricks take on Vietnam is one of the most powerful and psychological dramas ever made. Focusing on the schizophrenic nature of the human psyche  the duality of man  Kubrick takes us through a hell-like Parris Island boot camp and into the bowels of a surreal Vietnam through the eyes of Joker (Matthew Modine). Every facet of this film, as in all of Kubricks work, is top notch.

Jacobs Ladder (1990). Adrian Lynes thriller hits the psyche like a thunderbolt. A man (Tim Robbins) struggles with what he saw while serving in Vietnam. Back home, he gradually becomes unable to separate ""reality"" from the surreal, psychotic world that intermittently intervenes in his existence. This bizarre film touches on the sordid nature of war and the corruption of those who manipulate and experiment on us while we fight on their behalf. Good cast (especially Elizabeth Peña), an excellent screenplay (Bruce Joel Rubin) and adept directing make this film one nice trip.

Saving Private Ryan: The Invasion Sequence (1998). The long opening sequence of this film is unlike anything in any other Hollywood depiction of war. Its 25 minutes of barely comprehensible chaos and mutilation. Many veterans have stated that it is the most accurate re-creation of an amphibious assault. Credit for this sequence goes mainly to director of photography Janusz Kaminski  to be shared with editor Michael Kahn, sound designer Gary Rydstrom, writer Robert Rodat and director Steven Spielberg. Beyond this  i.e., the other 150 minutes of the film  Saving Private Ryan is a run-of-the-mill movie.

Jarhead (2005). Sam Mendes film follows a Marine recruit (Jake Gyllenhaal) through Marine boot camp to service in Operation Desert Storm, winding up at the Highway of Death. But what Mendes serves up is war as a phallic obsession in the oil-drenched sands of Kuwait and Iraq. Here soldiers fight not for causes but to survive in the nihilistic pursuit of destruction. Fine performance by Jamie Foxx as Sergeant Sykes.

As these films illustrate, war is indeed hell. With each and every passing moment, we move closer to the point of no return. Thus, it is time for what Martin Luther King Jr. called a true revolution of values that will lay hands on the world order and say of war, this way of settling differences is not just.

Speaking from the pulpit of Riverside Church in New York on April 4, 1967, King declared that the only solution is an all-embracing and unconditional love for all mankind. He maintained that We can no longer afford to worship the god of hate or bow before the altar of retaliation. The oceans of history are made turbulent by the ever-rising tides of hate. And history is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued this self-defeating path of hate.

375285,"This May, the United Nations will be holding a review conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), a key nuclear arms control and disarmament agreement to which 188 countries are now parties.

Originally proposed by the U.S. and Soviet governments, the NPT was signed at the United Nations in 1968 and went into force in 1970. Under its provisions, non-nuclear nations agreed to renounce the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear-armed nations agreed to divest themselves of their nuclear weapons through good faith negotiations for nuclear disarmament. In this fashion, nations on both sides of the Cold War divide signaled their intention to halt the nuclear arms race and move toward a nuclear-free world.

For decades, there was substantial progress along these lines. Non-nuclear nations refrained from building nuclear weapons. And the nuclear powers signed a series of important nuclear arms control and disarmament treaties: the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty; two Strategic Arms Limitation Treaties; the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty; two Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties; and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. At times, they even reduced their nuclear forces unilaterally. As a result, by the late 1990s, no additional nations belonged to the nuclear club, while the number of nuclear weapons deployed by the nuclear nations or in their stockpiles declined dramatically.

Starting in 1998, however, the nuclear arms race began to revive. Determined to place their nations within the ranks of the nuclear powers, the governments of India and Pakistan exploded their first nuclear weapons that year. Since then, they have engaged in dangerous and mutually threatening nuclear buildups. Other non-nuclear nations, including North Korea, took the first steps toward going nuclear, though the extent of their progress along these lines remains uncertain.

The nuclear powers also began to abandon their NPT commitments. In 1999, the U.S. Senate stunned much of the world, including U.S. allies, by rejecting ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Taking office in 2001, the administration of George W. Bush withdrew the United States from the ABM Treaty, opposed ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, began deployment of a missile defense system, pressed for the development of new U.S. nuclear weapons, and abandoned negotiations for nuclear disarmament. Responding sharply to U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty and U.S. plans for missile defense, the Russian government announced its intention to deploy a new generation of nuclear missiles. And China might not be far behind.

Why has there been a reversal of earlier progress toward a nuclear-free world?

A key factor behind the turnabout is the decline of popular pressure for nuclear disarmament.

Rival nations–and before their existence, rival territories–have always gravitated toward military buildups. This is based on the assumption–what might be called the ""old thinking""–that national security is best achieved through military strength. Not surprisingly, then, in a world of competing and sometimes hostile nations, governments are tempted to develop nuclear weapons to secure what they consider their ""national interests."" Thus, beginning during World War II and continuing during the Cold War, a growing number of rival governments commenced developing powerful nuclear arsenals.

Fortunately, however, the nuclear arms race of the Cold War era inspired widespread public resistance–resistance that took the form of mass movements for nuclear disarmament, feisty antinuclear marches and rallies, and public critiques of nuclear weapons by religious bodies, scientists, and cultural leaders. Polls found public opinion strongly opposed to nuclear buildups and nuclear wars. As a result, governments were pushed, often reluctantly, into agreements for nuclear arms control and disarmament.

But, since the end of the Cold War, the mass nuclear disarmament movements of the past have declined dramatically and public concern about nuclear weapons has dwindled. Furthermore, much of the lingering public concern has been manipulated by cynical government officials to bolster their own policies—as when the Bush administration exaggerated the Iraqi government’s readiness to wage nuclear war in order to justify its invasion of Iraq. Thus, freed of the constraint of popular pressure for international nuclear disarmament, governments gradually jettisoned their NPT commitments.

The situation, however, may be changing once more. Just as the nuclear arms race of the Cold War era inspired massive popular protest, the reviving nuclear arms race of recent years is beginning to generate substantial public opposition.

Much of this public opposition is crystallizing around the May 2005 NPT review conference at the United Nations, where nuclear and non-nuclear nations almost certainly will condemn one another for reneging on their treaty commitments. United for Peace and Justice (the major peace coalition in the United States), along with Abolition 2000 (a group focused on the nuclear issue), is laying plans for a nuclear abolition march and rally in New York City on May 1, the day before the review conference convenes. Noting that the NPT is ""in serious disarray,"" the organizers of these events have called for ""a massive demonstration"" to ""demand global nuclear disarmament and an end to nuclear excuses for war."" Large antinuclear meetings and other related events are taking shape in numerous American cities, with prominent speakers drawn from political, academic, and cultural life.

International organizations are also focusing their efforts on the NPT review conference. Stressing the importance of the gathering, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War is mobilizing for it as part of a Campaign for a Nuclear-Weapons-Free 21st Century. Mayors for Peace, an organization of top municipal officials from more than 600 cities around the world, has become particularly active in pressing the case for nuclear abolition. Headed by Hiroshima’s mayor, Tadatoshi Akiba, Mayors for Peace will be sending a substantial delegation to the NPT review conference for this purpose.

Thus, at this time of widespread uncertainty about the future of the NPT–and, more broadly, about the future of nuclear arms control and disarmament–there are signs that popular pressure is developing to put the world back on track toward nuclear disarmament. Whether this pressure will prove powerful enough to save the NPT remains to be seen. But there is certainly movement on this front. Fortunately, in the most dangerous of circumstances, people have a tendency to rise to the occasion.

The month of May is National Military Appreciation Month. Gee, I thought that every month was National Military Appreciation Month. Come to think of it, I thought that every minute of every day was supposed to be devoted to appreciating the military bombing, maiming, killing, invading, occupying, and intervening for the U.S. government.

467595,"Christianity and war: Are there any two things that one would think are so opposed to each other that “never the twain shall meet”? Unfortunately — and to the shame of Christians — that is not the case. And that is why I have revisited this subject yet again. I don’t suppose there is anything I write and speak about with more fervor than the biblical, historical, and political fallacies of Christians on the general subject of Christianity and war. In fact, my first article on the subject, back in 2003, was called “Christianity and War.” After twelve more essays that addressed the themes of Christians joining the military, Christians killing in war, the evils of war, standing armies, the follies of the Crimean War, World War I, and the Iraq War, Christian justification for the Iraq War, and the U.S. global empire, I published at the beginning of 2005 a slender volume titled Christianity and War and Other Essays Against the Warfare State that was introduced in an article here and reviewed on this site here and here. After the completion of these essays, I honestly thought I would have nothing else to say about the subject. But even as that book went to press, I realized that much more could and should be said, so I continued writing. The attacks on me (communist, anti-American, liberal, leftist, anarchist, pacifist, hippy, peacenik, Quaker, traitor, coward, appeaser, anti-war weenie) and the continued Christian support for Bush, the Iraq war, and the military only confirmed that there was much more that needed to be written. By the beginning of 2006, I realized that a new edition of Christianity and War was needed. I am pleased to report that a new, greatly expanded, second edition is now available. I have repeated in the introduction to this new edition what I said in the introduction to the first edition. These essays have one underlying theme: opposition to the warfare state that robs us of our liberty, our money, and in some cases our life. Conservatives who decry the welfare state while supporting the warfare state are terribly inconsistent. The two are inseparable. Libertarians who are opposed to war on principle, but support the state’s bogus “war on terrorism,” even as they remain silent about the U.S. Global Empire, are likewise contradictory. Christians who condone the warfare state and its nebulous crusades against “evil” have been duped. There is nothing “Christian” about the state’s aggressive militarism, its senseless wars, its interventions into the affairs of other countries, and its expanding empire. War is a subject that needlessly divides and sidetracks Christians. It is the author’s contention that Christian enthusiasm for the state, its wars, and its politicians is an affront to the Saviour, contrary to Scripture, and a demonstration of the profound ignorance many Christians have of history. This edition is likewise dedicated to the leading opponent of the central state, its wars, and its socialism: Lew Rockwell. New, however, is a foreword by Mike Reith, a retired Air Force major. The book now contains seventy-nine essays, organized under the headings of Christianity and War, War and Peace, The Military, Christianity and the Military, The Iraq War, Other Wars, and The U.S. Global Empire. The new table of contents can be viewed here. The essays span the four-year period from late 2003 to late 2007. Although many of them reference contemporary events, the principles discussed in all of them are timeless: war, militarism, empire, interventionism, the warfare state, and the Christian attitude toward these things. The first chapter is the largest, and contains twenty essays under the general rubric of “Christianity and War.” Besides discussing that subject, here I introduce some real Christian ministers who spoke out against war, point out the biblical errors of two other ministers who favored war, give a test to Christians to see if they are warmongers, identify the Christian axis of evil, expose the hypocrisy of Christian warmongers, reveal the unholy desire of Christians to legitimize killing in war, declare what the Church should be saying about U.S. foreign policy, discuss the fallacy of those who say that the commandment “Thou shalt not kill” never applies to killing in war, describe the use of religion in wartime by the state, explain how killing for the state can be murder, explore the attitude of the early Christians toward war, and answer the questions “What about Hitler?” and “What happened to the Southern Baptists?” In chapter 2, “War and Peace,” the evils of war and warmongers and the benefits of peace are examined. In chapter 3, “The Military,” the evils of standing armies and militarism are discussed, including a critical look at the U.S. military. In chapter 4, “Christianity and the Military,” the idea that Christians should have anything to do with the military is shown to be illogical, immoral, and unscriptural. In chapter 5, “The War in Iraq,” the folly of U.S. policy in Iraq is laid bare. In chapter 6, “Other Wars,” the evils of war and the warfare state are chronicled in specific wars: the Crimean War (1854—1856), the Russo-Japanese War (1904—1905), World War I (1914—1918), and World War II (1939—1945). In chapter 7, “The U.S. Global Empire,” the beginnings, growth, extent, nature, and consequences of the U.S. Empire of bases and troops are revealed and critiqued. The book also includes the text of my talk to the Republican and Democratic staff aides of the U.S. House of Representatives in Washington, DC, in May of 2006 and my lecture at the Future of Freedom Foundation’s Conference on “Restoring the Republic: Foreign Policy and Civil Liberties” in June of 2007. In view of the terrible Christian track record on support for the state, its wars, and its military, I suspect that this will not be the last edition of this book. Nevertheless, I send forth these seventy-nine essays as salvos against Christian warmongers and the warfare state that they shamelessly defend.

219525,"Note to readers: I just received a copy of this private memo regarding the Ayn Rand Institute’s recent column, ""A Passion Against Man,"" about Mel Gibson’s movie, The Passion. I eagerly pass it on:

URGENT MEMORANDUM!!!!

March 15, 2004

TO:The Ayn Rand Institute

FROM:Mel Morris, President, The Image Consulting Group, LLC, Inc., Etc., Los Angeles

RE:Recent Column on The Passion

Oy, oy, oy. Quite an interesting piece you guys put out the other day, called ""A Passion Against Man."" Very good, Onkar, or should I call you Dr. Ghate? I could almost hear Ayn reading it out loud, dramatic-style. As your image consultant, I’m pleased to see ARI engage in timely debates. That’s a good sign. But we need to do lunch pretty soon to talk about ""tone.""

I know you’re sick of my kvetching. But, really, guys, I’m on your side. I love Ayn Rand. I didn’t actually love her per se, although I know many people did. But I so much enjoy (if that’s the right word for it) her writing, especially that big long book with the gazillion page speech subtly implanted in the middle of it. Smooth. Can’t shrug it off (excuse the pun!). Great stuff, really.

I’ve read it so many times it hurts.

But, you know, we’ve got to sell some of these books and institute memberships to average people. I know you guys are smart, really smart. And did I mention heroic and noble also? But not everyone can be that way, and we need to package some of this writing a little more craftily, to appeal to the wider masses. I know that word, masses, is a no-no. But let’s be blunt here, if you don’t mind.

You know how much I hate to say it. But sometimes — well, maybe a little more than sometimes — these columns sound as if the writer forgot to take his meds. Let’s go back to Dr. Ghate’s ""A Passion Against Man."" It was great, really. I loved it. Brilliant stuff. Except for a couple places in the beginning, middle, and end, it would be perfect.

OK, let’s cut to the chase. Ayn wouldn’t beat around the bush, would she?

Third paragraph, in reference to the message of the Passion portrayed in Mel Gibson’s movie: ""It is frightening that so evil a message could receive so welcome a reception.""

Maybe I’m picking nits here, but do we have to call the Christian faith, er, religion, ""evil""? You know what I’m saying, bubbala, don’t you? A lot of people follow the words of what you call ""a man killed some two thousand years ago?"" No, don’t freak out. I’m not saying they should follow Him, I mean him. But they do. And, quite frankly, if you want to get your heroic ideas out to the public, it might be wise not to start by insulting their most hallowed traditions.

Just a thought.

Second, I’m no expert here, but you guys really need to read up on your Christian theology a little bit. From paragraph five, last line: ""For the anti-Semite, to be Jewish is to be evil. For the devout Christian, to be human is to be evil."" Now, I see your point, and I’m not against a little overstatement now and again. I have your best interests at heart, remember. But Christians don’t really believe that to be human is to be evil.

Christians merely think that human beings are sinners, and to avoid being evil they need to be repentant of their sins. I’m just playing devil’s advocate here (ha, ha!), but perhaps some of your readers — I’m going out on a limb, but not all Christians are stupid you know — will not take you seriously when such glaring mistakes go unchecked.

Two paragraphs later, the article suggests: ""To possess an inquisitive mind, a mind eager to explore the world and gain knowledge, is to commit the first sin."" It’s been a while since I cracked open the Bible, but I think the first sin was a little more basic than that.

Then you add this piece of analysis: ""To cherish the pleasures that the earth and one’s own body afford, including one’s sexual capacity is to be denounced as u2018selfish’ and even depraved."" Well, here again, I think you are misstating the Christian position just a tad. Christians don’t argue that ""exploring one’s sexual capacity"" is a sin; it’s only a sin if you choose to explore it outside of marriage.

Now, now, you might notice that members of one Christian institution are in a bit of trouble for doing a little too much exploring of their own (and some other people’s) sexual capacity in inappropriate ways. We wouldn’t want everyone in society being so explorative, would we? You really have to address the whole issue of human sin or misbehavior to be taken seriously when writing about weighty theological issues. We don’t want everyone acting without self-restraint, do we? Bear with me. I’m not trying to convince you of the virgin birth here, but even incorrigible atheists have to be at least somewhat glad that so many of their fellow citizens don’t act without Christian restraint.

Another thing. The article refers to the Christian ""anti-man approach,"" and warns that believers in the Christian message become ""ripe for any mystical dictator, who will wield the whip that is supposed to make man atone for his u2018transgressions.’ Deprive man of self-esteem, teach him to spit in his face, and one paves the way for another Dark Ages.""

First, a point of style. Regular people don’t usually use terms such as ""anti-man approach"" or ""mystical dictator."" You might want to loosen up a little and declare a holiday from using terms such as ""mystic"" and ""looter."" Just for fun. Then try varying the sentence structure a little. It gives columns a better cadence, making them easier to read and less like banging one’s head against the garage door.

Oh yeah, and one of my associates asked me to broach the subject of humor. I know, what’s funny to one person isn’t to another. But give it a whirl. Throw in a lighter comment, even toss a barb at St. Ayn Rand herself (that was a joke — I’m demonstrating by example!) just to see if you can disarm the reader.

Can’t hurt, can it?

Back to that Dark Ages passage. I dunno, but you probably need to deal with an obvious substantive point: As people become more apt to view Christ in your way, and to live without restraints, this world becomes a scarier place, more like the Dark Ages than the Enlightenment. Are you sure a lack of self-esteem is really the world’s biggest problem? Food for thought, that’s all.

There I go. Now you’re probably sure I’m some kind of mystic. I’m not, though. I’m just offering advice to help you get Ayn’s words and thoughts out to a wider public. Just trying to help you put out columns that actually get published and read. Enough said.

Let’s do lunch, soon, in LA.

Yours In Ayn,

Mel

Community leaders

on Easter Island have threatened to secede from Chile and transfer

allegiance to Polynesian states in a row over land rights and immigration.

Prominent families

from the indigenous Rapa Nui population have told the Pacific Islands

Forum, an inter-governmental body, that they wish to renounce Chilean

sovereignty and be considered part of Oceania rather than the Americas.

Easter Island

is a remote speck in the Pacific 2,300 miles west of Chile. It was

annexed by Santiago in 1888 and made a province of the Valparaiso

region but is considered a special territory, not least because

giant statues known as moais make it a Unesco world heritage site.

Leviante Araki,

head of the Rapa Nui ""parliament"", an advocacy group for

indigenous people who comprise half the 5,000 population, requested

secession in a letter this week to the Pacific Island Forum and

Chile’s President Sebastian Pinera. The would-be separatists resent

what they say is an uncontrolled influx of tourists and settlers

and accuse the government of taking over ancestral land with state

offices. Protesters occupied several state-owned buildings.

274580,"Cleaning your gutters is one of the un-sexiest home maintenance chores you can do. It’s usually dirty, you’re moving the ladder a lot, you’ll likely get wet from flushing the gutters, and it’s not exactly something you can show off once you’re done (like you can with a clean and organized garage). Not doing it regularly, though, can spell trouble for your home. If the gutters are too full, water can actually damage the roofing and the fascia (the boards behind the gutters, rather than the tough tissue in the human body). Overfull gutters can spell trouble below deck as well, as water pouring over the gutters versus going cleanly down the spouts can mean water getting to your foundation, and possibly into your basement and crawlspace. The torrents can also do a number on your garden beds if they’re right under the gutters.

While it’s a simple task, below I offer a few reminders and perhaps a couple new ideas on how to keep your gutters clean as a whistle, and thus protect your home for years to come.

Twice a year — once each in the spring and fall — is the recommended amount and timing for cleaning your gutters. In my neighborhood though, we have plenty of trees, meaning I’m doing it much more than that. After a big storm, or even just a couple months of wind and rain, I’m up there cleaning them out, even if it’s just to remove a downspout clog. And in the fall alone I do it a couple times as well with the bevy of leaves we get.

downspouts. Better to do this chore too much and keep your foundation safe than not enough.

Safety First

Don’t attempt to clean your gutters from the roof. You’d be turning this chore into a needlessly dangerous proposition. A ladder is going to be your best bet. Make sure you’re following best practices for ladder safety; cleaning out gutters is a simple task but it can quickly go awry if you aren’t paying attention. Perhaps most pertinent for this particular chore: don’t reach out further than is safe to do. It’s easy to think you can lean out as far as your body will take you, since it means moving the ladder less, but remember, keep your waist between the rails. Don’t contort yourself trying to get an extra few inches; the risk isn’t worth it. Since you’re moving the ladder a lot, on potentially unsteady lawns and gardens, also be sure you have stable and even footing; get a spotter if needed.

If you’re using an extension ladder, it’s a good idea to get what’s called standoff stabilizers. These will prevent the ladder from lying on the gutters themselves, which can cause damage.

For collecting the debris (rather than leaving it scattered about your property), you can lay out a tarp underneath your gutters, and just move it along with you when you move the ladder. If using an a-frame ladder, it’s also easy to use a bucket with a handle, which can be attached to one of the built-in hooks on the top of most ladders.

740958,"The most encouraging trend of our time is the widespread loss of faith in government. No longer do people look to the government as the great problem solver, economic planner, social unifier, or cultural czar. The government is more likely to be seen for what it is, a haven for grafters, liars, and would-be tyrants. Americans, like the Russians, no longer believe anything until it is officially denied.

It’s an encouraging trend because it foretells the restoration of liberty in economic relations, political and social self-determination, and in the autonomy of communities, families, and individuals. There are many barriers to these goals, but the largest is the overwhelming power of the central state, the foremost evil of our time. Its remaining power rests on its perceived authority, which, once stripped away, collapses leaving only the unimposed order of market relations and voluntary associations.

The turning point, of course, was the end of the Cold War and the return to normalcy some seven years ago. Ever since, the governing elites and their intellectual apologists have been searching for some grand national project to revive the spirit of collectivism from days gone by. Back then, hardly anyone questioned the need for the Leviathan state or the moral necessity of absolute obedience to the federal government.

To bring back the old days, there were massacres in Panama and Iraq. Then there were the “humanitarian” police actions in Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia. But public enthusiasm waned quickly, and these international schemes began to backfire by increasing opposition to government and all its works. The state has tried other diversionary tactics including the drug war, the everlasting war on poverty, the terrorist threat, the “crisis” of unaffordable health care, and a proposed manned mission to Mars.

Nothing works. There are no domestic or foreign crises left to grab our attention away from demanding what we should always demand, which is the ability to live normal lives unencumbered by the central state. “It’s hard when you’re not threatened by a foreign enemy,” President Clinton pouted after his State of the Union this year, “to whip people up to a fever pitch of common, intense, sustained, disciplined endeavor.”

Precisely, and may it always be so. Clinton’s attempt to make education a national issue fell flat because most people have an instinctive sense that education is and should be addressed at the local level. When we think about the federal government, its talent at managing the education of the young is not the first thing that comes to mind.

Government always takes advantage of the citizens’ sense of loyalty. It wants us to put the nation-state first, second, and third, so that our families and communities, our liberty and our property, are of minor importance. This is why Jefferson said the proper attitude toward government is not confidence and trust but eternal suspicion. If that was true of the constitutional government of his time, how much more is it true of a Leviathan state with a proven record of running scams, destroying wealth, telling lies, and needlessly harassing its citizens?

Not everyone is thrilled at these positive trends. Some people are panicked, especially the bureaucrats and politicians who have lost their exalted status in public life. Mario Cuomo says it all signals the loss of collective responsibility. “There’s no hero, no heroine, no great cause, no soaring ideology,” he says. We “need something to hold onto. Something deeper, stronger, grander” that can make us “better than we are.”

What is that something? The heroic central state, of course. To Cuomo, “better” means subordinating the individual to the collective. He openly longs for a socialist leader  he’s available, of course  to define and dominate our collective consciousness.

Intellectuals and journalists also want to return to the good old days of statism. They prefer times of national crisis, when people are willing to give up their liberty for the sake of common goals, like getting through a depression or beating some foreign foe.

“Communitarians” like Cuomo would have us believe that unless the tax state unites us in a common endeavor, nothing else will. For people like Amati Etzioni, the Golden Rule means give unto the state as the state prods others to give unto you.

Even more curious is the growth of national socialist ideology on the right, particularly in the pages of the Weekly Standard. David Brooks, a former writer for the Wall Street Journal, glories in the days when Americans trusted their government and never questioned its need for vast and increasing amounts of revenue. He proposes to bring those times back, not by giving anyone a good reason to love the government, but by embarking on another grandiose national program, which he equates with “greatness.”

The Panama Canal was “greatness.” The Library of Congress building was “greatness.” Trust-busting is “greatness.” Global supremacy is “greatness.” Wilson’s Fourteen Points, the New Deal, Kennedy’s New Frontier  “these were efforts to aim high, to accomplish some grand national endeavor.” How can these boondoggles be described in this way? Because “American purpose can find its voice only in Washington.”

But this voice has grown hoarse or silent, and Brooks thinks this means “we don’t have a clear sense of what America is for, what we, as a nation, should achieve with all our wealth.” he is not speaking of what individuals should achieve, but what the government should achieve with our money. And, oddly, he doesn’t even come up with a suggestion for what our new national project should be.

In fact, “it almost doesn’t matter what great task government sets for itself,” so long as it’s done with “energy and effectiveness.” For those who think that the government ought to defend the borders and otherwise leave everyone alone, Brooks offers this corrective: “the first task of government is to convey a spirit of confidence and vigor that can then spill across the life of a nation. Stagnant government drains national morale.”

His sentiments are nothing new. They are summed up by the Nazi slogan, Gemeinnutz geht vor Eigennutz, which means communal welfare precedes individual welfare. This has been and is the first principle of national socialism. As the party newspaper put it in 1936, “there exists no law which binds the State. The State can do what it regards as necessary, because it has authority.”

As an ideology, national socialism exalts the Great Leader as the embodiment of the national will, and insists that citizens be loyal to the nation-state and the regime above all else. It insists on a planned economy, where the priorities of the regime supercede those of private entrepreneurs. It glorifies the people working for the military sector or the civil service for answering a higher calling than “petty” business or professional life.

National socialism is protectionist and expansionist at the same time. Its trade policy tries to bar imports, but insists every other nation buy its products as a test of loyalty. Foreign regimes that don’t go along are denounced as enemies, and public hysteria is whipped up against them. National socialism has an ambitious foreign policy that attempts to gain control of whole regions in order to expand its global market share, and it praises global organizations dominated only by its own regime. Its chauvinism is worn on its national sleeve.

National socialism is different from international socialism in that the state prefers property control to nationalization. And it attaches sacramental significance not to class (as with Marxism) but to nationality (which in the U.S. means no more than paying into, or living off of, the welfare state).

In another distinguishing mark, its leaders deny the reality of economic law. That allos them to deny there is any downside to statism. They won’t admit that government programs cost money, which means taxes, which means coercing people to forfeit earnings they would otherwise use to provide for their families. What the state can’t get in taxes, it assumes in debt, which is followed by inflation that loots savings that could otherwise be invested to make people better off.

National socialism and aggression go together. Brooks, for example, praises war as a heroic enterprise, but never mentions how it results in the deaths of young people for the sake of the state and its connected interest groups. Who can doubt that oil barons were ultimately behind the U.S. intervention in the Gulf War? Is such a war worth the life of a young man who joined out of a desire to defend our own borders? That war had as its lasting effects the permanent stationing of troops in that region and the introduction of mysterious new diseases to the American continent, not to mention the deliberate killing by starvation and disease of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians.

National socialism also means a national police force, snipers shooting and burning political dissenters, and phony evidence presented at state trials. It means spying on people’s bank accounts, tapping their phones, reading their mail, grabbing their land, and stealing their children. It means a military and national security state unaccountable to the civilian population, a welfare state that grows without limit, a regulatory state that drives small business underground, and a tax system that causes whole sectors to stagnate.

It means that the central state is enlisted, in thousands of ways big and small, in a war against the citizenry. This was well describe in Gunter Reimann’s 1939 work The Vampire Economy, a compelling account of the plight of German businessmen under the Nazis. John T. Flynn, in As We Go Marching, told similar stories of business life under the New Deal. Making the link between varieties of socialism were Ludwig von Mises ( Omnipotent Government in 1944) and F.A. Hayek (The Road to Serfdom in 1945).

Business faces even more crushing burdens today, but people have gotten used to them. Thirty years ago, who would have imagined that two incomes would be necessary to support a middle-class existence for a family, and that economic conditions would force parents to turn over their children to strangers to raise? It’s been so long since we’ve experienced free enterprise, we’ve forgotten what it’s like to live in true prosperity and security.

Brooks longs for national socialism, knowing full well that it is precisely the system of government we have now. What is missing, in his mind, is the public spirit essential to making it thrive, the civil religion of statism. This is what the federal government started with Lincoln, and has tried to foster from McKinley to Clinton.

As Mises says, “the worship of the state is the worship of force.” This is why Brooks’s article is not only wrong, but also evil. What he celebrates as “greatness” is actually the greatest enemy civilization has ever encountered, the unencumbered rule of the political and bureaucratic class.

But in his apparently triumphalist article, Brooks is whistling past the D.C. graveyard. National socialism is no longer an option. It’s been tried, and it’s failed. The locus of national life has at least shifted outside the beltway. Few care anymore what Washington has to say, and fewer still believe it when they hear it.

Even more importantly, the fear that once restrained fundamental criticism of the government is largely gone. And this fact, more than any other, is what is driving the power elite out of their living minds. Their authority is now radically in question. Let the media and the political class decry this as cynicism, or even hate. People who can look beyond this bloody century of statism, and imagine the truly great ideal of liberty, rejoice at the meltdown of the national socialist state.

467245,"George W. Bush is a natural born liar. He lied us into a war, and now he is lying to keep us there. In his October 6 self-congratulatory speech at that neoconservative shrine, the National Endowment for Democracy, the President of the United States said: ""Today there are more than 80 Iraqi army battalions fighting the insurgency alongside our forces.""

Eighty Iraqi battalions makes it sound like the US is just lending Iraq a helping hand. I wonder what Congress and the US commanders in Iraq thought when they heard there were 80 Iraqi battalions that American troops are helping to fight insurgents? Just a few days prior to Bush’s speech, Generals Casey and Abizaid told Congress that, as a matter of fact, there was only one Iraqi battalion able to undertake operations against insurgents.

I wonder, also, who noticed the great contradiction in Bush’s speech. On the one hand, he claims steady progress toward freedom and democracy in Iraq. On the other hand, he seeks the American public’s support for open-ended war.

In her Princeton speech, Condi Rice made it clear that Iraq is just the beginning: ""We have set out to help the people of the Middle East transform their societies. Now is not the time to falter or fade.""

On October 5 Vice President Cheney let us know how long this commitment was to last: ""Like other great duties in history, it will require decades of patient effort.""

Who’s going to pay for these decades of war to which the Bush administration is committing Americans? Already the US is spending $$7 billion a month on war in Iraq alone. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service says that if the Iraq war goes on another five years, it will cost at least $$570 billion by 2010.

Bush’s war has already doubled the price of gasoline and home heating.

With US forces bogged down in Afghanistan (invaded October 7, 2001) and Iraq (invaded March 20, 2003), Bush is plotting regime change in Syria and conspiring to set up Iran for attack.

Is there a single person in the Office of Management and Budget, the US Treasury, the Congressional Budget Office, or the Federal Reserve who thinks the US, already drowning in red ink, has the resources to fight wars for decades?

And where will the troops come from? The US cannot replace the losses in Iraq. We know about the 2,000 American troops killed, but we do not hear about the large number of wounded. UPI correspondent Martin Sieff reported on October 7 that US wounded jumped from 16.3 per day at the end of September to 28.5 per day at the beginning of October. Multiply that daily rate by 30 days and you get 855 wounded per month. Approximately half of these are wounded too seriously to return to combat.

Has anyone in the administration pointed out to Bush, Cheney and Condi Rice what decades of casualties at these rates mean?

Insurgents are killing Iraqi security personnel who are collaborating with the US occupation at the rate of two or three hundred per month. The wounded numbers are much higher.

Last month suicide bombers killed 481 Iraqis and wounded 1,074.

Has anyone in the administration put these numbers in a decades long context?

Apparently not. Once these numbers are put on paper, not even Bush administration speech writers can continue to pen rhetorical justifications for war and more war.

The neoconservative Bush administration prides itself on not being ""reality based."" Facts get in the way of the administration’s illusions and delusions. Bush’s ""80 Iraqi battalions"" are like Hitler’s secret weapons. They don’t exist.

Iraqis cannot afford to collaborate with the hated Americans or with the puppet government that the US has put in place. Out of desperation, some do, but their heart is not in it. Few Iraqis are willing to die fighting for the United States.

When the 2nd Iraq Battalion graduated from US training camp on January 6, 2004, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and US commander in Iraq, Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, expressed ""high expectations"" that Iraqi troops, in the general’s words, ""would help us bring security and stability back to the country.""

Three months later when the 2nd Battalion was brought up to support the US invasion of Fallujah, the battalion refused to fight and returned to its post. ""We did not sign up to fight Iraqis,"" said the troops.

Readers write in frustration: ""Tell us what we can do."" On the surface it doesn’t look like Bush can be stopped from trashing our country.

The congressional mid-term elections are a year away. Moreover, the Democrats have failed as an opposition party and are compromised by their support for the war. Bush has three more years in which to mire America in wider war. If Bush succeeds in starting wars throughout the Middle East, his successor will be stuck with them.

Congressional Democrats and Republicans alike have made it clear that they are going to ignore demonstrations and public opinion. The print and TV media have made it clear that there will be no reporting that will hold the Bush administration accountable for its deceit and delusion.

There still is a way to bring reality to the Bush administration. The public has the Internet. Is the antiwar movement well enough organized to collect via the Internet signatures on petitions for impeachment, perhaps one petition for each state? Millions of signatures would embarrass Bush before the world and embarrass our elected Representatives for their failure to act.

If no one in Congress acted on the petitions, all the rhetoric about war for democracy would fall flat. It would be obvious that there is no democracy in America.

If the cloak of democracy is stripped away, Bush’s ""wars for democracy"" begin to look like the foreign adventures of a megalomaniac. Remove Bush’s rhetorical cover, and tolerance at home and abroad for Bush’s war would evaporate. If Bush persisted, he would become a pariah.

Americans may feel that they cannot undercut a president at war, in which case Americans will become an embattled people consumed by decades of conflict. Americans can boot out Bush or pay dearly in blood and money.

So I wish people would stop telling me that I should enjoy the Olympics, or be proud of them, or think that they will in some way benefit this country.

But they wont stop telling me. Hardly a day goes by without another previously independent mind surrendering to this pseudo-religion of obligatory smiles.

And that makes me suspicious. What is this strange cult? In the end, the Olympics is nothing more than a large athletics meeting.

Before Hitler and Dr Goebbels made it into a torch-lit and grandiose spectacle, you could be in the same city as the Games and barely notice.

Are we really that interested? And if we are, are we interested for good reasons? Personally, I find it very odd that large crowds have turned out in the street to see a glorified pilot light carried about in a large cheese-grater.

Even odder is the fact that there has been no fuss at all about the appalling treatment of a boy on a bicycle who had the temerity to ride alongside the procession in Haverhill, Essex, on Saturday, July 7.

It is hard to see from the film, but he looks about 12 to me. As he comes level with the portly torch-bearer, he is seized by a baseball-capped Torch Guard, spun round, clasped by the neck, thrown to the ground, almost in front of a moving car in the procession, which visibly brakes hard, pinned down on the road and finally hustled on to the pavement.

Youd think hed tried to assassinate the Monarch, not ridden his bike too close to the Goebbels flame.

I cant see much difference between the behaviour of the Torch Guard and that of the menacing Chinese goons we all disliked so much four years ago when they escorted Dr Goebbelss candle round the world.

The event happens so quickly that most of the crowd barely notice. But I have now watched it several times, and it makes me angrier every time I do so.

This is supposed to be a light-hearted, generous-spirited event. But it isnt really. Its an overbearing, officious, self-important celebration of corporate greed, unpunished corruption, tolerated cheating and multiculturalism.

As for it being a demonstration of the greatness of Britain, what can I say? If they gave out Olympic medals for fatherless families, deindustrialisation, graffiti, violent disorder, traffic congestion, illiteracy, swearing or really high train and bus fares, wed be going for gold in a big way.

I suspect these are features of our country we want to hide from potential investors  in which case, why is the stadium adorned by a structure that looks like an abandoned and vandalised blast-furnace?

And then there are the alleged economic benefits. Ho, ho, ho. No doubt these will be calculated according to the Martian mathematics under which something we were told would cost £2.3 billion actually cost £9.4 billion  and this was announced as an underspend.

Will the world be impressed? Well, would you be impressed if a family in your street, who were jobless, undischarged bankrupts with delinquent children, whose roof leaked, whose wiring was dangerous, whose garden fence was rotten and whose unmown lawn was full of weeds, suddenly hired a marquee and a brigade of maids and waiters, and invited everyone to a noisy champagne party?

Count me out of the compulsory joy. It reminds me all too much of May Day in Soviet Moscow. I once thought that was all over, but now I realise that its coming here.

State of the what? Let’s see, 28%, 31%, 33%, 35%. That pretty much sums up the State of the President — or, at least, of his ever more dismal approval ratings in four of the latest major polls (and don’t even mention his state of approval in similar nose-diving polls abroad). Only two Presidents, on the eve of a State of the Union Address have ever scored lower — and one was Richard Nixon at 26%, seven months before he resigned his Presidency. (The other was Truman at 23% and mired in the Korean War.) Unbelievably enough, those aren’t even the worst figures around for this administration. Try 26%, 29%, 29%, 30%; that’s about how many Americans now think any presidential State of Iraq plan or strategy makes the slightest sense according to polls by Newsweek, CBS, the Washington Post/ABC News, and NBC/the Wall Street Journal. A little lower and you’re in the polling basement, the sort of place not normally accessible even to a bunker-busting President.

Basically, if the networks didn’t cut off all prime-time programming for the State of the Union Address, I suspect that the percentage of Americans bothering to listen to George W. Bush’s words might prove infinitesimal. After all, as the latest polls all essentially indicate, but Mark Murray wrote of the NBC/WSJ poll, “Nearly two-thirds of Americans appear to have given up on success in Iraq and also on [George Bush’s] presidency.”

In fact, we would undoubtedly do better to stop listening to any of the official words of this administration, since they bear next to no relationship to administration acts. This State of the Union Address, which will be analyzed to death in the press and on TV, matters not a whit. Never has an administration reached for its dictionaries faster or more often to redefine reality to fit its needs. Seldom has the media spent more time parsing (and then generally passing on) words that were meant to do little but promote fantasies, escape responsibility, and confuse the public. It’s the acts — all aggrandizing, all aimed at promoting the unfettered power of a President and Vice President who never learned the word “enough” — that matter, as former federal prosecutor Elizabeth de la Vega, shows in exploring the latest administration maneuvers to slip past any congressional or judicial oversight of, or responsibility for, its illegal program to spy on Americans.

If you want to read some words that do matter, check out De la Vega’s remarkable new book, United States v. George W. Bush et al., which, in the form of a hypothetical indictment of the President and his key officials and fictional grand jury testimony, brilliantly dissects the way the administration used language to defraud the Congress and the American people into war in Iraq. This Tomdispatch book is, as Chalmers Johnson has said, “Much more powerful than the 9/11 Report. A tour de force.” (You can order it from Amazon, so don’t miss it.)

Now, as a bow to the real state of our tattered, battered union, which will go unaddressed tonight, Tomdispatch turns to de la Vega to explore a few of the acts for which this administration should be held responsible. ~ Tom

Lying and Spying: How the Administration Slip-Slides Away

By Elizabeth de la Vega

I hope I can be forgiven if animal images kept coming into my mind during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week. On the eve of the first such hearing to be held by the newly-elected Democratic majority, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales sent a letter to Committee Chairmen Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Arlen Specter (R-PA) announcing that, henceforth, the President’s Terrorist Surveillance Program would be conducted under the supervision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Listening to Alberto Gonzales “answering” questions about this development during the hearing, the thoughts I kept having were of seals and snakes: Had the administration really flip-flopped on warrantless electronic surveillance — like, say, a seal — or was it merely attempting to slither away — like, say, a snake?

Unfortunately, it appears to be the latter. As with so many of its other activities — pre-invasion intelligence fraud, detention of enemy combatants, systematic torture — the closer the Bush administration comes to intersecting with the law and with Congress on its illegal spying, in the words of Paul Simon, “the more you’re slip-slidin’ away.”

Well, Where Have We Been?

Unbeknownst to the American people and Congress — the phrase that should begin so many stories about the Bush administration — the President, starting in late 2001, authorized a secret domestic surveillance program to be run by the National Security Agency (NSA). By the time the secret wiretapping was revealed in a New York Times article on December 16, 2005, George W. Bush had issued more than 30 orders authorizing surveillance for what the administration claimed were foreign intelligence purposes, without ever attempting to comply with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”). A law Congress enacted in 1978 to prevent the Executive Branch from conducting such surveillance without any court supervision whatsoever, FISA was simultaneously to provide a more expeditious procedure than that required for a standard search warrant.

In the four years between the inception of the program and its revelation, the Bush administration affirmatively concealed its existence, with the President, famously, even going so far as to preemptively — and falsely — announce that “any time you hear the United States government talking about wiretap, it requires — a wiretap requires a court order. Nothing has changed by the way.”

Even worse, in that time span, Attorney General John Ashcroft and then Alberto Gonzales successfully negotiated with Congress four rounds of requested changes to FISA, the very statute they were routinely violating. Not once during the faux debate about security and civil liberty generated by the amendments they sought did the administration advise Congress in any official or unofficial way that it was violating the statute on a daily basis; nor did it seek revisions that would address the problems it later claimed existed.

Given such egregious conduct — conduct, in fact, unprecedented in our history — one would think Congress would take swift and decisive action. Hardly. An astoundingly earnest debate ensued over the administration’s ever-changing rationales and frivolous legal arguments (superbly reviewed at Glenn Greenwald’s excellent blog, Unclaimed Territory), but as Patrick Leahy described this sorry state of affairs:

“On March 31, 2006, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on Sen. Russ Feingold’s call to censure the President. This was the Committee’s fourth hearing to consider the President’s domestic spying activities. But while the Committee has now heard from a total of 20 witnesses, only one had any knowledge of the spying activities beyond what was reported in the newspapers. That witness was Alberto Gonzales, who flatly refused to tell us anything beyond u2018those facts the President has publicly confirmed, nothing more.'”

In short, neither Congress, nor the public knew anything more at the end of the Senate hearings in 2006 than they had known when the hearings began. The administration slithered off without being held to account for, or required even to superficially reveal, its activities. And Congress itself simply slip-slided away.

Where Did We Think We Were Going on January 17, 2006?

On January 17, it appeared that, under the leadership of Democratic Senator Leahy, we might begin to get some answers from Alberto Gonzales at the Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing scheduled for the next day about the President’s secret surveillance program: What is it? When did it begin? Who does it target? How are its targets chosen? Is it, as the law requires, particularized — directed toward a certain target — or simply a data-mining program that collects massive amounts of corporate and public online information and then cross-references it against U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement records? Who carries it out? What is the legal justification for surveillance outside the FISA statute?

It also seemed that we were proceeding in an orderly fashion towards a judicial review of the NSA spying program. In August 2006, in the case of ACLU et al. v. NSA, United States District Judge Anna Diggs Taylor of the Eastern District of Michigan ruled that the administration’s National Security Agency warrantless surveillance program must be stopped, both because it violated FISA and because it constituted an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment right to free speech and the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The United States appealed and, although the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the execution of Judge Taylor’s order pending that appeal, it scheduled the oral arguments on the case for January 31, 2007. How the Court would rule is impossible to predict, but one possible outcome, of course, would be a decision that the administration’s domestic spying program is, as Judge Taylor had found, both unconstitutional and illegal under the U.S. Criminal Code; another would be a finding that the spying program was illegal based on one of those grounds.

From the administration’s point of view, in other words, as of January 17, the NSA eavesdropping plan was careening towards not one, but two very dangerous, intersections. What does the Bush administration ever do under such circumstances? Address its adversaries and make its arguments openly and honestly? No. Its modus operandi is always the same. It evades; it manipulates the system; it darts away — or at least it tries to.

In this case, by preemptively announcing that it was no longer going to conduct the program whose existence it had hidden completely for four years — and sparred with Congress about for the next 18 months — the administration clearly fervently hoped that it could wriggle away from congressional and judicial oversight. The ploy was, in other words, less a flip-flop than a slither. But the maneuver, clever as it appears at first blush, is hardly a surefire remedy for the administration’s problems.

Where the Heck Are We Now?

On the same day that the Department of Justice announced its decision not to reauthorize its unilateral, illegal wiretapping program, it notified the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals that it would be submitting documents setting forth its arguments regarding the effect of this decision on the pending appeal. Clearly, the government lawyers intend to argue that the case is moot: There’s nothing left to decide because we’re not doing it anymore.

There are, in fact, many legal counterarguments to this facile approach. For one thing, even if one assumes, for the sake of discussion, that the FISA problem has been addressed by the administration’s new plan, the constitutional questions might still remain. There is another significant argument that weighs against the dismissal of the case for which the administration has been so cleverly maneuvering — a doctrine holding that the court should still hear controversies that may have been resolved when the issue under consideration is “capable of repetition, yet evading review.” This doctrine is particularly applicable to this situation, where neither the Court, nor Congress, nor the public have any way of knowing whether the administration has in fact abandoned its previous practices or whether it will ever decide to reinstate them. For such determinations, everyone has to rely on the word of Alberto Gonzales and the whims of the Department of Justice. The American Civil Liberties Union and the many diverse plaintiffs who have joined its lawsuit — Greenpeace, writer Christopher Hitchens, and Larry Diamond of the Hoover Institution, to name a few — will certainly make this powerful argument in the weeks to come.

The same rationale argues powerfully in favor of Congress forging ahead, regardless of Gonzales’s bland assurances. Not only do we not have any guarantee that the administration is doing what it says its doing, or will continue to do what it says it plans to do, we still don’t have the remotest idea what that plan is. As Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) pointed out during questioning of Gonzales, we don’t know whether the warrants now being issued involve specific targets, as is required by FISA, or whether the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has simply agreed to give blanket approval to warrants directed at a large group of targets, the very problem that Congress has theoretically been trying to address since early 2006: “If it’s a very broad-brush approval — and again, because it’s secret, we have no way of knowing — it doesn’t do much good,” Schumer commented.

We do, however, have a remarkably consistent track record on this matter, which should tell us something. We know that none of the administration’s conduct with regard to Congress and the National Security Agency domestic spying program has been undertaken in good faith. Indeed, the second phase of this odyssey, from December 2005 when the secret program was revealed, to the present, begins with the same phrase as the first: Unbeknownst to the American people and Congress…

Unbeknownst to the American people and Congress, during 2006, while everyone else — navely thinking we lived in a democracy — engaged in this ongoing faux debate, earnestly trying to divine what the administration was actually doing, discussing the pros and cons of the nearly laughable arguments they were making in support of whatever it was, and in good faith attempting to craft amendments to FISA that would accommodate the unique requirements of whatever it was that no one knew, the Bush administration was acting entirely on its own as if neither the public, nor Congress even existed.

We may still be stumbling around in the dark, struggling to get a grip on what the administration is doing, but we are getting nearer to the destination; this, then, is decidedly not a good time for Congress to be slip-slidin’ away. On the contrary, wouldn’t this be a good time to reach for a subpoena?

 What is that sound? Do we hear a fat lady? “Prices have been falling in London for the last eight months,” said Merryn Somerset-Webb, editor of MoneyWeek, yesterday. “Just like I said they would,” she added.

From the other side of the Atlantic, comes news that housing starts were down 17.6% last month — the biggest drop in 14 years. In other news, the “Economy wobbles under cost of oil,” says one headline from the new world. “GM lost $$1.1 billion in the first quarter,” says Bloomberg. GM is being “eaten alive by a free lunch,” says a Washington Post piece. At Ford, prospects are not much better. “Bleak outlook,” says the FT of Ford’s future.

 Kevin Kerr comments on the Consumer Price Index for March, which saw the highest monthly increase in the index in two and-a-half years:

“The impact of surging oil and gasoline prices has certainly been reflected in today’s higher CPI numbers. Short term, this may indicate that a slow down in demand is imminent, albeit very short. Oil prices are struggling to stay in positive territory today, even on the back of the surprisingly bullish inventory numbers. This also indicates that the market price may be a little top heavy.

“There are a great many analysts who strip out food, energy and other essentials from the CPI number. As someone on the NYSE floor said today, if you do that “It’s like we are all naked, living in caves.” I agree…CPI is only accurate when looked at as a whole, not piece by piece. Continuing high prices will likely drive some consumers to cut back on discretionary spending until energy costs get reigned in a bit, and we may be seeing that now in the crude which should continue to fall. This will probably only last until the end of summer for crude; conversely, gasoline prices will likely remain very high all summer, I expect to be paying $$3 a gallon by July here in Connecticut.”

 The “one, true and holy Church” has a new master, or should we say, a new servant. The white smoke signaled that a new pope had settled onto the throne of St. Peter. What does the new pontiff think? “We are moving towards a dictatorship of relativism which does not recognize anything as for certain and which has at its highest goal one’s own ego and one’s own desires,” said Cardinal Ratzinger in his homily. He quotes St. Paul; people are “tossed by waves and swept along by every wind of teaching arising from human trickery.”

 Today is Adolph Hitler’s birthday. “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man,” wrote George Bernard Shaw in “Man and Superman.” Hitler was an unreasonable man. Does all progress depend on people like him?

Typically, Shaw lost the plot completely. Reasonable people make progress by taking reasonable steps in their own private lives. Unreasonable people insist that other people drop what they are doing and walk in the direction they tell them. If they are good demagogues, the rabble rouses to them and begins shouting puerile slogans: Tax the rich! Germany needs room for living! Onward to the Holy Lands! Make the world safe for Christians! Make the world safe for democracy! Freedom! Save the Union! Decent housing…and adequate recreation! The next thing you know someone is robbed…shot…or hung from a tree.

Right now, there isn’t enough known about the circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, a black, by George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old part-Hispanic, during his neighborhood watch tour in an Orlando, Fla., suburb. If evidence emerges that Zimmerman’s actions were not justified, he should be prosecuted and punished; however, there’s a larger issue that few people understand or have the courage to acknowledge, namely that black and young has become synonymous with crime and, hence, suspicion. To make that connection does not make one a racist. Let’s look at it.

Twelve years ago, a black Washington, D.C., commissioner warned cabbies, most of whom were black, against picking up dangerous-looking passengers. She described “dangerous-looking” as a “young black guy … with shirttail hanging down longer than his coat, baggy pants, unlaced tennis shoes.” She also warned cabbies to stay away from low-income black neighborhoods. Did that make the D.C. commissioner a racist?

In some cities, such as St. Louis, black pizza deliverers have complained about having to deliver pizzas to certain black neighborhoods, including neighborhoods in which they live. Are they racists? The Rev. Jesse Jackson once remarked, “There is nothing more painful for me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps and start thinking about robbery — (and) then look around and see somebody white and feel relieved.” Does that make the reverend a racist?

The former Charleston, S.C., black chief of police, Reuben Greenberg, said the problem facing black America is not racial profiling. He said, “The greatest problem in the black community is the tolerance for high levels of criminality.” Former Los Angeles black police Chief Bernard Parks, defending racial profiling, said: “It’s not the fault of the police when they stop minority males or put them in jail. It’s the fault of the minority males for committing the crime. In my mind, it is not a great revelation that if officers are looking for criminal activity, they’re going to look at the kind of people who are listed on crime reports.” Are former police Chiefs Greenberg and Parks racist?

According to the Uniform Crime Report for 2009, among people 18 or younger, blacks were charged with 58 percent of murder and non-negligent manslaughter, 67 percent of robberies, 42 percent of aggravated assaults and 43 percent of auto thefts. As for murder, more than 90 percent of the time, their victims were black. These statistics, showing a strong interconnection among race, youth and crime, are a far better explanation for racial profiling and suspicion than simple racism.

Black Americans have spoken out against racial profiling by police. They’ve been insulted by store personnel who might give them extra scrutiny. There’s the insult of the sound of a car door being locked when a black approaches. It’s insulting to have taxi drivers pass up a black person and pick up white people down the street. In a similar vein, I’m sure that a law-abiding Muslim is insulted when given extra scrutiny at airports or listening to Fox News reporter Juan Williams, who was fired by National Public Radio in 2010 for publicly saying that he gets nervous when he sees people on a plane with clothing that identifies them as Muslim. Blacks and Muslims who face the insults of being profiled might direct their anger toward those who’ve made blacks and crime synonymous and terrorism and Muslims synonymous.

God would never racially profile, because he knows everything, including who is a criminal or terrorist. We humans are not gods; therefore, we must often base our decisions on guesses and hunches. It turns out that easily observed physical characteristics, such as race, are highly interconnected with other characteristics less easily observed.

For most blacks to own up to the high crime rate among blacks is a source of considerable discomfort. Beyond that, it creates suspicions and resentment, which are destructive of good race relations, and it’s devastating to the black community, which is its primary victim.

377109,"The latest Foreign Policy web-only exclusive, written by neoconservative J. Peter Pham, is an analysis of the Somali piracy problem, something Pham has been assessing for some time. The subtitle of the article ""Why the U.S. Navy Can’t Win this Fight"" is appealing in its prescience.

But what the author really means to say is that the U.S. Navy can only win the fight with the help of other navies, UN and US-led nation-building in Somalia (both in Puntland and presumably Somaliland which have functioning self-government, as well as in the southern Ethiopian-occupied Somalia, which does not).

Rather than being liberals mugged by reality, neo-conservatives can be likened to muggers promised redemption for a few public good works. Their souls chained by a sense of limit on every good thing, eager to appease and please their gangbosses, and with an unshakeable faith in the use of force on the weak — neoconservatives persist in the halls of government and throughout the government-dependent media.

Hoodlums in suits they truly are, although it’s possible some of them mean well. But high-minded muggers cannot imagine real solutions to the problems of sea piracy. Instead, they put forth more state-on-individual intervention, more national and international bureaucracy. Like other criminals, they suppose the rest of us will pay for it, in blood and honor, and be grateful we were spared our very skins.

The history of private security is not glorious, inevitably souring with its proximity to government contracts and politicians. Nonetheless, it met — and meets — a need for commercial security that offers a decentralized way to think about the problem of robbers, whether they be Robin Hoods, out-of-work fishermen, teenage boys — or the global money launderers than make this aspect of the world go round.

Popular movies like The Thomas Crown Affair, and the American love affair with our individualistic, independent and armed forbearers tell one side of the story. The notoriety and faithlessness of the global defense contractors working with — and against — governments for cash and ideology — as seen in this season’s 24 — tells the other side.

Every clue is available to government decision-makers — yet the obvious solutions to piracy and indiscriminate hostage-taking escape the Obamites and congressional Republicrats. To solve the problem of cargo and crew seizure for ransom, decentralized decision-making and decentralize actions will work best, at minimal cost, with minimal destruction and violence.

Insurance rates in the Gulf of Aden have risen tenfold. This recent spate of news coverage belies the fact that sea piracy has been around for centuries — and indeed we already know something about how to reduce it. In the Straits of Malacca, South China Sea and Indonesian waters, insurance rates have increased drastically, routes altered, and some freight companies have hired onboard security guards. A 2004 study explains

""These guards … are being deployed discreetly, because the legal status of armed guards on board commercial vessels is not clear under international law. …If the guards use deadly force, they and their employers may be criminally liable. Yet the policy is pursued because it is working; numerous, potentially deadly piracy attacks are being thwarted on a daily basis by the mere presence of armed guards, who, working in groups of four to eight per ship, often do not have to fire even a single shot in order to keep the pirates at bay. Ship owners also favor hiring armed private security guards because the practice may help them negotiate better insurance premiums.

It goes on: ""The deterrence effect can also be achieved when pirates know or expect that the ships’ crews themselves carry firearms. Pirates deliberately avoid Russian- and U.S.-flagged ships, for example, because they believe that many of them carry small arsenals for protection."" Incidentally, the crew of the US-flagged Alabama was not armed — and yet was still able to get the better of the four Kalashnikov-armed hijackers. This heroism is individual and team based, autonomous. Unlike the famously overplayed stories of a Flight 93 passenger uprising — where no after-action interviews may be conducted — we will be subjected to far more noise today about the heroism of Naval commanders and Navy snipers hidden on the fantail of the USS Bainbridge.

A business-oriented, personal responsibility-friendly, insurance rate-enhancing approach will never be recommended, suggested, or condoned by ""state sovereignty"" types. American missions must be justified, sunk cost in a global police force rationalized. Obamites and their neoconservative allies, around the world and regardless of their political coats, prefer war, prefaced by political and economic intervention of those perceived to be weaker or less worthy than ourselves.

Perhaps one of the companies formerly known as Blackwater will see new opportunities in private commerce protection. Of course, they’d need plenty of subsidies and guaranteed long-term contracts. No need to advocate decentralized market-based solutions just yet — let’s wait for more state-sanctioned war, more justification for American hostility and use of force around the world, more generalized fear here at home. Then, perhaps Xe or a subsidiary will jump in the game, complete with congressional blessings and taxpayer cash.

Whether the drug war, the poverty war, the war on terror, or the war on piracy — for our government, it’s always first things first. Establish the moral high ground of the state, centralize decision-making, bureaucratize and internationalize the legitimate policy discussion, drum fear and uncertainty into the hearts of markets and populations, demonize the ""enemy"" and smear as co-conspirators any individual actors offering non-state solutions, and make the erstwhile victims as helpless as possible.

We could lighten up on sovereign—greed oriented regulation on shipping companies and freighter captains, and let the real producers of wealth decide how to proceed. We could take a look at where some of this ransom money is being laundered, and with no additional bureaucracy, easily shut down some of our white-collar friends. Instead, Washington is alive with possibility — tut-tutting excitedly about international or sub-regional coast guards, invasion of Somalia for its own good, academic study of the pirate tactics of 17-year-old boys, and the barbarous behavior of others.

Of course, the reality is usually much more innocuous, but that doesn’t mean that the groups don’t have some fascinatingly weird practices, or that they haven’t had an impact on world events.

Ordo Templi Orientis is a mystic organization that was started in the early twentieth century. The group was established along the same lines as the less secretive Freemasons, and supposedly relies on ritual and occult practices as a means for members to move from one level of prestige to another within the organization. The general philosophy of the group was a belief in new age esoteric principles and practices as a method of realizing one’s true identity. Famed occultist and all-around eccentric Aleister Crowley composed much of the group’s lore, including a manifesto called the Mysteria Mystica Maxima, and he later became its head. After his death, the influence and popularity of Ordo Templi Orientis began to wane, but it still exists today and has various chapters scattered across the world, chiefly in the United States, the U.K., and other parts of Europe.

Secret Practices

As Aleister Crowley’s popularity as a new age figure has continued to grow, more and more of the teachings of the Ordo Templi Orientis have come to light. As such, the group makes much less of an attempt to be secretive today than it did in the past. This doesn’t mean that they don’t still have some bizarre practices. Chief among these is the group’s fixation on the sexual, especially their teachings on the “adoration of the phallus” and the magic of masturbation.

9. The Bilderberg Group

Famous Members

The Bilderberg Group is not a secret society per se, but it does operate under a similar veil of mystery, which has made it the subject of countless conspiracy theories and criticisms. The group was started in 1954, and since then it has convened every year as an exclusive, invitation-only conference of various world leaders, captains of industry, and media moguls. The group was originally started as a means of addressing a streak of anti-Americanism that was spreading through Europe following WWII, but over the years it appears to have morphed into a more broad discussion on reaching mutual understanding between cultures.

Secret Practices

The Bilderberg Group has become controversial for one key reason: no press is allowed in the conference and no significant details concerning the topics discussed are ever officially released to the public. That kind of secrecy, along with the intense security of the meeting sites, which often feature armed guards, police, and even fighter jets patrolling the skies overhead, has produced a number of conspiracy theories centered on the conference. The most popular is that the group tries to steer the direction of public policy, financial markets, and media in certain prescribed directions of their choosing, perhaps even with the goal of forming a so-called “one world government.” These claims have been brushed aside by the group, which claims global understanding and the end of nuclear proliferation as its main goals.

8. Hashshashin– The Order of Assassins



Famous Members

None of note

in order to establish a utopian Shi’ite state. Because their number was small, the group used guerilla tactics in their battle against their enemies, including espionage, sabotage, and, most famously, political assassination. The Hashshashin would plant highly trained moles inside enemy strongholds, with instructions to only attack when the time was right. They were known for their extreme discretion in minimizing civilian casualties, as well as their penchant for using stealth to intimidate their targets. As the story goes, enemy leaders would often wake in the morning to find a Hashshashin dagger lying on their pillow, along with a note saying “you are in our grip.” Their legend soon grew, and before the Mongols finally destroyed the group, they became well known contract killers, supposedly performing jobs for the likes of King Richard the Lionheart.

Secret Practices

Around the time of their downfall, the library that contained all Nizari records was destroyed, so much of what is known about them today has taken on the status of myth. The most controversial legend centers of the group’s use of drugs and other intoxicants– “Hashshashin” translates roughly as “Hashish user”–which some have said were employed by the members in battle. This has been widely discredited, but the term “Hashshashin” as it refers to the Nizari is believed to be the origin of the modern word “assassin.”

7. The Black Hand

Famous Members

Gavrilo Princip (rumored)

propaganda and training saboteurs and assassins to disrupt political rule within the province. Their plan was to incite a war between Serbia and Austria, which would give them a chance to free their country and unite the different Slavic nations as one.

Secret Practices

Black Hand would be all but forgotten today if not for their unlikely involvement in one of the biggest events of the twentieth century. In 1914, the group engineered the assassination of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The job was badly botched, and was only completed when a low-level hood named Gavrilo Princip stumbled upon the Archduke’s car and shot him to death at close range (see photo). Still, the results of the assassination were catastrophic. Within days, Austria-Hungary had declared war on Serbia, and after the allies of both countries joined the fray, the small dispute managed to escalate into WWI. The aftermath of WWI eventually led to WWII, and this led to the Cold War, which makes the Black Hand one of the most strangely influential forces of the twentieth century.

469436,"The analysis below explains why all empires and ""Imperial Style"" governments have failed throughout history, and why our Empire-USA faces the same fate. The only question is whether the people and government of the USA have the wisdom and will to engage in a ""Managed Decline"" by terminating the empire and imperial conduct on their own schedule, rather than by chaotic crash of the US Dollar, economy, and lifestyle. Take notice of the ""Solutions"" section in Part C below.

Part A: Key Points

An Empire is a nation that: 1) Owns colonies, and/or 2) Controls, or has great influence over, other nations. Empires require economic and military strength to start and maintain, and this is expensive.

All Empires fail, and for the same reasons: 1) Expense of military abroad, and subsidies at home. 2) Decline in domestic productivity (spoiled, parasitic citizens). 3) Corruption (illegal conduct) and decadence (unethical and immoral conduct) by leaders and citizens.

Empire-USA: Our deal to other nations is: we will be the worlds policeman and protect you, but you must accept our fake money and ""influence."" The USA is far into Phase 3-Failure. Look around you for the symptoms shown in Part B-3 and Part C below.

Chart Height Shows Combined Military and Economic Strength (Power and Wealth)

Part B: Events/Symptoms in each Phase

Phase 1  Growth

Land: Gain territory by ""discovery"" (too bad for the natives), or conquest.

Strength: Start growth of economic and military strength. Sound currency (precious metal, or convertible paper and convertible base-metal coins).

Government: Local and central government acts as a servant to protect the rights of citizens. No entangling alliances with other nations. New land is governed as a colony or part of homeland nation (becoming a sovereign republic may require a revolution). The army consists of volunteers protecting their homes and families, with no professional or standing army.

Ethics: Most government people and citizens are hard working and honest. Government is a servant.

Phase 2  Maturation

Land: Add contiguous land, or remote colonies, by conquest or negotiation.

Strength: Become a world leader in both economic and military strength. Homeland receives cheap imports from colonies. Currency is debased to allow more government spending, without raising taxes.

Government: Grows stronger, more corrupt, and acts as boss, manager, nanny, owner, etc. Elected officials will do almost anything to retain their jobs. Power is used to manage other nations to impose/protect the Empire’s interests. The central government increases control (superiority) over local (city and state) functions, often based on its power to create money to fund local projects. A standing army is created and consists of mostly conscripts, and professional careerists. Wars become more oriented to building and defending the Empire.

Ethics: Corruption and decadence grow due to decline in personal responsibility caused by nanny state.

Phase 3  Decline and/or Failure

Land: Lose colonies, or control of other nations, by revolution or voluntary release (due to expense and unrest).

Strength: No longer a world leader. Power declines by 50% or more, especially in foreign matters. Value of fake currency crashes in purchasing power by 50% or more. Default on debt (or pay off with low value paper money).

Government: Becomes weak, more corrupt, and desperate. Leaders try to gain power (decrees, martial law, etc.) to survive citizen discontent. ""Bread and Circuses"" grow, now called grants, subsidies, stimulus, and entitlements. The army consists of mostly professional careerists, and volunteers, many of whom join because they can’t find work elsewhere. Standards are lowered (criminal records, non-citizens, health issues) to aid recruiting for wars of empire (non-defense). Use of mercenaries and contractors grows toward 50% or more of total staff, and their loyaty is to their Generals (or Corporate officials), and original homeland, not the country that pays them.

Ethics: Corruption and decadence are rampant in both social and government conduct. Failure occurs as either: A) Nation survives, but at a reduced level of strength and standard of living (England, France, Italy, Spain, and Russia are examples; see list in Part D), or B) Ceases to exist due to takeover by other nations or groups.

Part C: Empire-USA is in Phase 3: Decline and/or Failure

Problems:

High Expenses: The expense to maintain bases, and fight wars, worldwide exceeds the monetary and political benefits. The US has over 850 military bases, with troops (not counting embassies), in over 130 countries, and the US acts as the worlds policeman to protect its interests, and impose influence. Resistance by our ""subjects"" is building. Military expenses are a drag on the economy, and the troops get less than ideal equipment due to cost problems. Host nations are unhappy having our occupying troops.

High Debt: The US is a bankrupt Empire by any measure. It cannot hope to pay back over $$13 trillion in national debt, or the about $$50 trillion unfunded future obligations of domestic programs (Medicare, Social Security, etc.). Interest payments are huge. The US Dollar (USD) is still the worlds reserve currency (held as if gold by other nations; it can be viewed as a share in USA Inc.), despite the fact that the US is also the worlds biggest debtor, but doubts are rising in other countries who use and own dollars for trade. This combination has never occurred before in history! Thus, since all US government debt is denominated in USD, the government can create new low-value dollars out of thin air to pay its debts! A new form of default! The USD is in a precarious position due to excessive expansion of the money supply (inflation) and the USD could crash in value at any time. The extreme is hyperinflation, when the money becomes almost worthless. As with heroin, lots of fake money (the Federal Reserve Bank calls it liquidity) feels good at first, but has withdrawal pain called recession or depression. Since the Federal government never runs out of money, it often becomes the funder for state projects (with strings attached), and states’ rights wither. This gives vote-getting power to Congressmen, and acquiescent State officials suck it up to avoid taxing to raise state funds.

220461,"I return to the period of the Middle Ages, having previously written about kingship and law andsocietal relationships. I will turn now to the economy of the time, based on the book The Birth of Western Economy, by Robert Latouche.

Having described the fall of Rome in the first chapters, Latouche turns to the earliest beginning of medieval society and economy. He describes several aspects of this period of transition.

The Migrations

He begins with the earliest migrations:

The Roman Empire recognized two great Germanic families: the Western Germans who for long centuries had been settled in continental Europe, and the Northern and Eastern Germans who had emerged in more recent times from Scandinavia.

There were mentions of immigration into the Roman Empire by Germanic people as early as the late first / early second century.

…the Germans then gradually and by progressive stages penetrated into the Empire along the entire length of the limes in ever-increasing numbers….

Eventually, the numbers were significant enough that treaties were negotiated with Rome, recognizing the various tribes as “federates.”

…most of the barbarians who penetrated into the Western Empire came not as conquerors, but exactly as in our own day…to look for work.

The conquest was not so much a military one; Rome fell as much due to the apathy of the productive caused by the economic policies of the state as it did from anything else. What did the barbarians conquer? They came to an undeveloped land. The forest was their enemy; the bogs were their subjects:

He had to wrest from virgin forest, from moorland and sometimes from bog, the land on which he settled, and the task of bringing Central Europe into cultivation was a slow and unremitting process of land clearance which went on until late into the Middle Ages.

Private Property

These migrants apparently did not make the same mistake as did the Pilgrims of New England. Counter to the views of some – and built on a faulty reading of historical (but not more contemporary) sources – the cleared land was not held in community ownership, but in private ownership.

The historian Fustel de Coulanges set out to demolish this edifice built on sand….the Franks and other Germanic peoples from very ancient times practiced individual ownership, and that the alodis frequently referred to in barbarian laws is the equivalent of the Latin hereditas, and is none other than the hereditary estate.

There was some land common to the community, primarily forest land. This demonstrates a rather sophisticated view of private property – that of homestead. The cleared land was viewed as private property; the land in an unimproved state was not. This concept of individual ownership was captured, for instance, in the Salic Law:

What a study of the Salic Law does bring out…is the strong preference of the Franks for individual ownership…. One single word, which has had an extraordinary history, symbolizes the sacrosanctity of hereditary property – it is the word ‘alleu’ [freehold] (alodis). In the very beginning this word stood for the ancestral home and its appendages. Subsequently it was extended to include the arable lands.

This freehold of property was an important feature throughout the Middle Ages, first coming up against resistance in England in the time of William the Conqueror in the eleventh century, when he claimed all land as his own, with the nobles as his tenants.

The Birth of the Nobles

The armies of Rome as well as those of the tribes consisted fundamentally of foot soldiers. This came to an end when the tribes were faced with enemy horsemen from the Far East.

A horse cannot be equipped or a horseman armed without money, and the men destined to serve in the king’s host were expected to possess a certain fortune…. One of the most lasting results of this revolution in the art of war was that whilst compulsory military service was not abolished, it no longer applied to everyone…. No longer were all free men soldiers, but only the richest of them….

These horsemen, these new soldiers, were gradually to turn into the nobility.

You Can’t Replace Something with Nothing

Rome was no longer able to govern. The tribes were free from centralized state control, but this does not mean to suggest that there was no organizing body – only that is was not a body of coercive state force.

The Church contributed in large measure to the rescue of town life by fitting her temporal government into the framework bequeathed her by the Roman Empire, and it will soon become evident that the cities survived by what amounted to a process of substitution. On rural life too, though for quite different reasons, her influence made itself felt, and in a manner no less unexpected. The Church then became a great administrative body, with divisions based closely on those of the state…. The Church became a moral entity endowed with juridical power.

As such, the Church was to reap financial benefit, as this position stimulated the generosity of the faithful. “The goods bequeathed consisted chiefly of country estates,” and such wealth accumulated toward the benefit of monasteries, many founded as poverty-stricken establishments. Yet over the course of time – and in the early Middle Ages – many monasteries had accumulated prodigious wealth.

…kings and nobles lavishly endowed them with huge tracts of cultivable land in a passion of generosity which verged on the reckless….

The wealthy donors previously had received from Rome, as part of the treaties established while Rome still had marginal power, vast swaths of land – land that proved too large to manage. It was from such sources that the donations were made. Often, the land was fallow or forests previously used for hunting. Credit is due the monks for turning such land into productive ground.

The author attributes this generosity to the guilt of the wealthy – a hope to buy salvation, to avoid eternal punishment. Whatever the reason, the payment was voluntary. “Thus the institution of monasticism acquired in less than two centuries a vast number of estates….” With this wealth, and with the infrastructure provided by the Church…

…the bishops [took] on a host of varied responsibilities which in normal times would be assumed by the public services of the state…

This included the building of aqueducts, assistance to the poor, and hospitality to travelers and the sick. Notably, the Church did not provide for a standing army, monopoly over coinage, or monopoly over law and justice.

Religious and ecclesiastical activity saved the lives of a host of Gallo-Roman cities, the existence of which was threatened by Merovingian apathy…. The presence of a religious element ensured the survival of old urban centres threatened with slow decay, and even brought others into existence.

I mentioned previously this author’s favorable view of state institutions. A flavor of this is found in the above statement – regarding the so-called “Merovingian apathy.” It is true that Merovingian society was not centrally controlled and directed via a coercive state. Where the author views this as a detriment, it strikes me as a blessed gift.

That the Church (in the context of the times; else other voluntary institutions) took the place of several state functions should be expected in a land without a state. You can’t replace something with nothing (h/t Dr. North). Individuals within communities will organize towards outcomes that are found to be beneficial. When done in a voluntary manner, this is the most glorious of outcomes.

Towns sprung up adjacent to the monasteries; not surprising given the wealth of the monasteries and the work available to the population. This development was ongoing, continuing even during the time of the Viking invasions and prior to the reopening of Mediterranean trade.

From Slave to Serf

Under the Roman Empire the ground had usually been cultivated by gangs of slaves under the supervision of the master himself or of a bailiff (villicus). In each villa there was a familia rustica or band of slaves responsible for the farm work.

Coincident with the decay of Rome, side by side with these slaves were free workers: some as a result of migration from the failing Roman cities, some as a result of smaller farms forming together one large farm, and some set free by will of the owner.

While in some cases these free men still carried the stigma of the slave, the life was much different – they led a family life, living with wife and children. Of course, the free man will work harder than the slave, and such an example is offered by the author: Saint Martin riding on his donkey, looking for a suitable bishop for the diocese of Le Mans, noticed…

…a clerk named Victor working in his own vineyard (in vinea sua laborans) with great zest and vigour, turning it over with his spade, and covered in dust from head to foot.

In this milieu comprised of freemen and slaves, the transition was occurring:

…all in fact lived on the land they farmed, and without actually owning it thought of it as their land, and handed it down to their children.

Along with the development of the Noble class, there was an increase in small farms and small farm holdings held by relatively free men:

…the Merovingian age saw an increase in the number of small farms and small holdings, and that these fulfilled, though still imperfectly it is true, the secret longing of every peasant – to have a plot of land big enough to support a family and which can be handed down to his descendants.

I have learned that the concept of “ownership” and “property” can mean different things in different times and places. The characteristic of being able to pass along property to heirs certainly is fundamental to the concept of “own.”

Summary

The transition from Rome to the Early Middle Ages was not a sudden change, but occurred over time. It was not due solely or even primarily to attacking, warring hordes of barbarians, but driven by the decay of an extended empire, with citizens accustomed to living from the sweat of conquered slaves. The Romans attempted to prolong the Empire via inflation, price controls, work rules, and taxation. As the citizens could – and in order to survive – they left, withdrawing their consent. They found better prospects outside of the protection of the centralized state.

At the same time, individuals from the Germanic tribes were migrating closer to Roman territory, and even within it. Rome negotiated treaties with these tribes in an effort to maintain some control over the territory. Eventually, the decay of Rome overcame the value of the treaties.

Via a firm belief in private property and the role of the Church in a more voluntary form of organization, the roots of the Middle Ages were formed. The so-called apathy of the Merovingians was, in fact, the victory of a decentralized, voluntary society.

We will next see Charlemagne’s attempts to centralize this world. Fortunately, his successes will not last.

281903,"Friedrich Nietzsche wrote in part:

""Deep within all the noble races there lurks the Beast of Prey, bent on spoil and conquest. This hidden urge has to be satisfied from time to time, the beast let loose in the wilderness… The noble races have everywhere left in their wake the catchword “barbarian…""…their utter indifference to safety and comfort, their terrible pleasure in destruction, their taste for cruelty  all these traits are embodied by their victims in the image of the “barbarian,” and “evil enemy,” the Goth or the Vandal… ""

Bush's ""Just Cause"" was to thwart Saddam's WMD and his partner Osama bin Laden and their attempts to obliterate America using a Holocaust of nuclear and biological weapons. Bush said, ""We must strike now before the enemies of our way of life complete their mission."" This has proven to be a rhetorical Grand Illusion with no WMD's and no Osama bin Laden partnership.

Without any forethought to what was meant to happen and the unintended consequences of what did happen, Bush, like a latter day Vandal, has ravaged Iraq. Bush's indifference to the horrors visited on the citizens of Iraq will reach our shores in payback. Americans will reap a whirlwind of revenge which will make the Twin Towers seem like child's play in comparison. All due to Bush and his innocence of the Beast of Prey conscience despite the depredations visited on the people of Iraq.

The ""Axis of Evil"" is not Nations. The real evils are people like Rove, Feith and Cheney or Rice, Rumsfeld and Bolton. Bush and his Disciples of Manifest Democracy believed they would be welcomed with open arms and flower-strewn paths. Too bad these un-welcoming Iraqis made the mistake of being born over fields of Black Gold and wanting the fields for themselves.

Bush and his Beast of Prey driven by blood lust are barely slaked by the sacrifices of American troops. This Crusade will continue in the name of ""The Noble Cause"" and requires sending troopers to die while fighting under the false flag of the"" War on Terrorism.""

Bush and the Beast of Prey shouts,"" Cry Havoc! Let Lose the Dogs of War!"" and ""Onward Christians Soldiers""! Bush needs these bloody sacrifices for his Altar of Conquest. Who gets the spoils of War? Hail Halliburton, KBR and all government contractors. Fill the coffins with fallen warriors while lining your pockets with Greenbacks.

Bush and the Beasts of Prey do not care how many die in the name of the Noble Cause. Why should they! It is someone else's sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters who pay the ultimate price. Never the spawn of the Beast of Prey! These spawn have other priorities and can not be sacrificed.

Bush and his Beast of Prey neglect to face one priority as their rotating of troops to Iraq eviscerates the Guard and the Reserve. The War on Terrorism in Iraq has a chilling effect on recruiting of new volunteers for the military. The Law of the Jungle military recruiting slogan of ""Learn to Kill or Be Killed"" is certain to attract recruits meeting the reduced standards of education and ""smoked a toke  hey haven't we all?"" We should feel safe knowing an armed, badly trained, semi-educated 18-year-old ex-drug addict is protecting us from terrorists.

Bush and his Beast of Prey send his half-trained, semi-equipped, semi-armored Christian Crusaders into battle against the Infidel Terrorists. Then can only stand by and watch how so few terrorists tie up the Warriors of Democracy. Bush does not listen to the voices begging for better training, personal armor and knowledgeable senior officers who understand 4th Generation warfare. He turns a deaf ear to those who suffer dis-membering wounds. His generals create tactics and strategy which only alienates the very people Bush is trying to save for Democracy. Bush just keeps on believing those haunting cries in the Wilderness do nothing but give aid and comfort to terrorists.

Remember the rousing glory of,"" Mission Accomplished""! Two and a half years later Bush and his Beast of Prey said yesterday,"" Our efforts in Iraq and the broader Middle East will require more time, more sacrifice and continued resolve.""

How much more effort over what period of time is needed to resolve the sacrifices being made by everyone but Bush and his Beast of Prey?

I’ll serve pinto beans on them. We can break the wind to the tune of The Star Spangled Banner. Let Papa Jack help you to understand the nature or political speech and the market for it.

You see, it’s a well-established fact that dung has always been worth money. Bat guano, for example, has always been a lucrative business, as is the excrement of seabirds. They’re valuable fertilizers for growing vegetables. The same is true of political speech. Of the same inherent nature as bat guano, it is valuable for growing vegetables, er, voters. Or, rather, voters to come vote. So they hope. But this is not the crap that is mined or gathered into bags, so to speak. It is written by the “hired guns” of the scribe world, that is ghost writers.

Here’s how it works, kids. I’m Hillificent Clonebama and I’m running for president. I haven’t got time to write speeches, not that I could anyway. I’m busy paying people off to hide evidence that could lead to a felony indictment or at the very least the equivalent of a political wedgie. Therefore, I hire Scam-Masters Public Relations Firm and Hot Dog Grill to write this crap for me. Not only will they do a better job, but they’ll do it without bursting into laughter and peeing their pants. Well, maybe they do, but at least not in the team-building meetings. They’ll even come up with a spiffy campaign slogan that one might usually read on a box of plain-wrap breakfast cereal, but there you go.

Scam-Masters has a staff of ghost writers who then write these speeches and also writes the blog that I am supposedly writing myself. If I have a book, then a ghost writer scribbled it out. Hopefully without too many things that a half-hearted investigation would turn up as more phony than a four dollar bill. I know, the phrase is “three dollar bill”, but we’ve got inflation and all that. So the price of metaphors has gone up. I know some college professor will email me and say, “That’s not really what a metaphor is, Jack!” Hey, you know what? Contact my speech writer, okay? I’m busy running for president and executive-order-daily-dictator over here.

Yes, and the buffoonery eats it all up! They actually think these people wrote the books, blogs, and speeches! I worked for a company several years ago and got to see their marketing department in action. Here’s how it’s done. Names have been changed to protect the innocent from the lawyers of the guilty: Acme Green Widgets has a green energy widget they just decided to release to the market even though it isn’t really ready yet. But because they Clinton Cash: The Unto... Peter Schweizer Best Price: $$6.99 Buy New $$10.97 (as of 05:45 EST - Details) want to pump up the company to take it public and make money off the stock, they need to release this widget and hype it up. Besides all of that, all of the performance data of the widget was cooked because the engineers cherry-picked widgets off the assembly line until a “hot rod” was found and used the performance curve off that widget to represent them all.

What Acme’s marketing department did was to write an article about this widget and then used a public relations firm who released it to the press as the “work” of a press agency who, in fact, just snapped up the “article” because it was free. Therefore, this article was published in several newspapers AS NEWS when, in truth, it was nothing more than a cleverly crafted and re-worded sales brochure. People read these articles and said, “Gosh, those widgets sound like they can save me a lot of money! I better call Acme and see about one!” What’s more, through several key phrases such as “green energy” sprinkled through the article, it turns up on web searches.

Now, the thing is, most large companies do this. But what’s more is the government does this, too. The first Gulf War back in 1990-1991 was sold to us thanks to a PR firm that manufactured the whole “atrocities” nonsense. Today, every political campaign is doing this. The Pentagon is doing this. The entire government is doing this. Our entire political system is, in a very real sense, being engineered by a few hundred writers who often don’t even know who or what they are writing for. I ask you when people are arguing about what is written in the Constitution and Bill of Rights, is anyone aware that what is written today by people wholly outside of the political establishment is determining the future of our nation?

See these articles talking about how invincible and powerful our military is? Yes, the Pentagon wrote that themselves or hired someone to write it. Because you’re sitting there and wondering how on Earth any of this is possible, right? Well, pick up your shovel and just ladle it on the rose beds because that’s what it is.

I’ve always told you: Always Assume It’s A Scam. Because it is. These politicians say what is written for them. The Pentagon and the government tells you what they want you to believe. To make sure you believe it, they make sure it isn’t seen as coming from them, but from the good old newspaper. The Soviets had Pravda and people bought it because the paper was thin enough to roll tobacco in for cigarettes. We have an allegedly privately-owned media, but it still prints propaganda because it’s free and it helps the profit margin to do that. And you’re never told that this war being sold to us is being hyped up from articles the United States military wrote.

If you believe these elections are not a sham written like a script, I’ll sell you the Golden Gate Bridge. If you believe our wars are not engineered in advance and then sold to us once they’ve decided to go ahead and start them, then I’ll sell you the Statue of Liberty. And I’ll also sell you the Constitution because the United States government is obviously not using it anymore.

457185,"The Phoenix Program in Vietnam in many ways provides a blue print for our own times. Assassinations and torture are the essence of the war on terror. As are death squads and false flag terror attacks. As are mass surveillance of the populace.

Thanks to the work of Douglas Valentine in his classic book The Phoenix Program we have an extremely detailed account of the Phoenix Program exposing a classic example of the brutality of the CIA’s counter insurgency wars. By studying the Phoenix program one can gain a great deal of insight into the wars in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq.

How the book came to be written is an interesting story in its own right. Doug Valentine had written a novel about his father’s experiences in a prisoner of war camp during World War 2 called “Hotel Tacloban.”

He decided his next book would be on Vietnam and he decided to focus on the CIA role since little had been written on the topic. He approached former CIA Director William Colby for help. He sent him a copy of his book and the former CIA director decided that Valentine was a man who understood the harsh realities of war and agreed to meet with him. Valentine cut his hair, bought a suit and tie met with Colby and managed to gain his confidence. Colby believed Valentine would write a sympathetic account. After all, the CIA is used to working with journalists who censor the truth in exchange for inside information. Colby arranged for him to meet hundreds of former agents.

Valentine had managed to penetrate the inner world of the CIA. Amazingly, it took years for the CIA to suspect that Valentine had no intention of writing a sympathetic account of their crimes in Vietnam. By then it was too late, he already had hundreds of hours of taped interviews. He wrote his book, one of the most detailed accounts of a CIA program ever; however the CIA used it’s influence with the New York Times to kill the book with a bad review. The book was buried in obscurity. Valentine was forced to give up writing and became a private investigator, but fortunately one of the contacts he made while writing Phoenix Program helped him find an even more scandalous story, and he went on to write “The Strength of the Wolf” and the “Strength of the Pack” which expose in great detail the phony nature of America’s decades-long war on drugs. Doug Valentine is one of the most fearless researchers alive today. His works are required reading for anyone interested in the CIA, organized crime, and America’s corrupt establishment.

What was the Phoenix Program?

From the perspective of a bureaucrat like Bill Colby it was merely an attempt to coordinate a number of pre-existing programs. Sort of like the Department of Homeland Security or more precisely its fusion centers where military, police, and intelligence agencies pool information on their enemies, the American people. Phoenix sought to provide cooperation between various Vietnamese and American agencies so that they could coordinate their war on the Vietnamese people. What was the Phoenix program? A massive campaign of torture and assassination aimed at destroying what the CIA called the Viet Cong Infrastructure (VCI). Amusingly this term was as confusing to Vietnamese as it probably is to you.

They had to hold a massive conference to attempt a translation and the word they ended up using only further confused the Vietnamese. By infrastructure the Americans meant not roads and bridges but the civilian shadow government the Communist revolutionaries had set up across the country. In many places they were the ones in real control on the local level and they used their power to fight for land reform on behalf of the peasants. America’s South Vietnamese allies, however, were a corrupt class of elitists who supported the landlords against the peasants and were hated by the majority of the populace. For the Vietnamese the Vietnam war was a revolution aimed at land reform and re-uniting the country.

Since they had popular support, the National Liberation Front had hoped at first to win power peacefully; however the Americans had Installed Ngo Dinh Diem as dictator and he ruthlessly crushed all opposition, attacking not just the Communist National Liberation Front but all competitors for power, including Buddhists and fellow nationalists. His power was narrowly based in Vietnam’s Catholic minority and he relied on a massive network of corruption to maintain loyalty. After tens of thousands of their supporters had been killed, the National Liberation Front appealed to the North for help. When Vietnam was split, thousands of South Vietnamese had moved north, not wishing to live under Diem’s regime. In North Vietnam they had been trained in political organization and guerrilla warfare. They were sent south to help organize the revolution. They formed what were known as armed propaganda teams. They would enter villages at night, administer some revolutionary justice by executing a corrupt local official in front of the whole village and then would explain the goals of the revolution, educate the village about the crimes of the regime, and even stage plays and read poems.

The NLF expanded their control over the countryside and set up their own system of government. This system extended from the local level of small committees to the top level COSVN which planned the strategy for the war. It was this system that the CIA targeted with the Phoenix program.

Interestingly the Phoenix program had its roots in an attempt to mimic the tactics of the Viet Cong. Vietnam was quite literally a giant laboratory to study counterinsurgency tactics. In the early days of the CIA presence, there various CIA province chiefs were allowed to experiment with different ways to combat the growing revolution. Ralph Johnson decided to create the mountain scouts to imitate the tactics of the armed propaganda teams. Recruiting hardened criminals, Viet Cong defectors, and various ethnic minorities like the Hmong, and Montagnards the CIA formed brutal death squads highly trained in methods of covert war. They would sneak into a village at night and brutally slaughter someone they suspected of working with the NLF, along with their families and any witnesses, and hope the attack would be blamed on the Viet Cong themselves.

They called the tactic counter-terror, ironically, since what they were doing was terrorism. In fact, throughout the Vietnam War the CIA staged false flag terror attacks, even bombing theaters and blamed them on Viet Cong ‘Terrorists.’ It’s surprising this aspect of the war is little mentioned, given its special relevance today; however the primary purpose of the death squad commandos was to sneak into NLF-controlled territory and kidnap and kill a target. In contrast to most such forces, like the Contras in Nicaragua in the 80s (trained by people from the Phoenix program) or the fascist volunteer battalions in Ukraine today (often poor fighters, effective only at terrorizing unarmed civilians), the Provincial Reconnaissance Units (PRU), as the CIA’ Vietnamese death squads were renamed, were the most effective fighting force in South Vietnam. They would form one of the primary elements in the Phoenix Program. Along with the Field Police, they would be the enforcers.

The next element of the Phoenix program was the Province Interrogation Centers (PIC). Using a CIA front company, PacificArchitects, and Engineers, the CIA built prisons all over the country to be used to torture political prisoners. They are exact forerunners of today’s CIA black sites which now dot the world, aiming to torture people to produce real or fabricated intelligence, recruit double agents, break people’s spirits and terrify the rest of the planet into submission. Vietnam was covered with these torture sites, often featuring the only modern building in a village. At first, the Viet Cong made freeing the prisoners a major goal, and they staged a number of successful attacks until the PICs were redesigned to make them more secure from outside attack. Inside the prisoners were subjected to horrific tortures, starvation, beatings, electric shock and rape.

Through a special program, USAID, the infamous CIA front that pretends to dole out charity, distributed telephone generators to be used by CIA-trained secret police around the world to torture their people. Vietnam was only one example. People would be held for months and there were few survivors. In return, these PICs would obtain names for further targets who would be either killed or sent to the PICs to be tortured to generate even more names in an endless cycle of horror. Many who ended up there were not even part of the resistance. Instead, many were the victims of extortion who failed to pay the proper bribes and whose names were fed into the system. Others were set up by their personal enemies. Still others were enemies of the VC, who had infiltrated all aspects of the South Vietnamese government. They were masters of espionage who were able to feed the names of their enemies into the system.

The third aspect of the Phoenix program was intelligence collection. The CIA maintained a network of spies throughout the country and attempted to assemble a master list of all the NLF members in South Vietnam.They set up the Intelligence Coordination and Exploitation program (ICEX) in an attempt to coordinate intelligence from the CIA, the Vietnamese Special Branch (which ran high-level NLF infiltrations), the Field Police, the PRU and US military intelligence; however, in reality, this proved impossible since the South Vietnamese were always plotting against each other and jealously guarded their secrets. The various agencies were tools of the various factions in South Vietnam’s Machiavellian political struggles. After the fall of Diem, Vietnam experienced a long string of coups as South Vietnam’s generals battled each other for control. In addition, each sought to use his position to enrich himself by engaging in drug trafficking, embezzlement, prostitution and protection rackets. How the CIA’s allies occupied themselves hunting down the NLF was only a minor concern. Of course, many US contractors, military officers, and CIA officers also managed to earn fortunes in various corrupt schemes.

The war was undertaken in part simply to enrich the corporate elite back home. Additionally, the military and the CIA were in competition, with the latter unwilling to share information. The military often assigned people to Intelligence with no prior experience or training, instead only giving them a short training course before making them case officers. Thus, for obvious reasons, the CIA considered them amateurs; However despite the difficulties, they were able to create a massive database of names of people they believed made up the NLF. In addition to gathering intelligence, the massive network of agents was a means for the CIA to buy loyalty, and the amount the CIA paid to agents in bribes exceeded USAID’s entire development budget for South Vietnam. As mentioned, Phoenix was a further attempt to coordinate these various elements into a program to eliminate what they called the VCI.

Phoenix was thus a massive program to capture and kill VC, with prisoners being tortured to reveal more names. It was also a massive psychological operation aimed at the mind of the enemy. Such operations range from propaganda to terrorism and both were prominent features of the Phoenix Program. Edward Landsdale, former advertising executive turned CIA counterinsurgency expert, was an important pioneer in these tactics. In the Philippines he had played on local superstitions about vampires in one famous example. He had used his agents to spread rumors that vampires were infesting the area the local guerrillas were camped.

When enough time had passed, his commandos grabbed a guerrilla bringing up the rear of a column, drained his body of blood and left it along the trail to be found the next day. The trick worked and the guerrillas fled the area. Another favorite tactic was to paint an eye facing the front door of those they suspected of supporting the guerrillas as a threat before later kidnapping killing and torturing them. Thus whenever they painted one of these eyes they were sure to terrify their target and let them know they were being watched. Landsdale called it the eye of God.

In Vietnam the CIA would use variations of both these tactics. They played on Vietnamese beliefs about the afterlife to add additional horror to their murders. The Vietnamese believed the liver and the third eye were important to reaching heaven. The CIA would have the PRU cut out their victims pineal gland and even have them eat their livers. Thus, their victims would not only be killed but denied an afterlife. They left the eye of God painted on corpses. They would also use variations of the eye of God technique. They would fly over their targets addressing the guerrillas by name and telling them to surrender before it was to late. They put up wanted posters to keep NLF cadres from being able to travel freely.

They even issued comic books explaining the benefits of being an informant. They dropped billions of propaganda leaflets throughout the country. These often backfired because they showed a cruel disregard for the populace by constantly threatening them with death and destruction. The CIA had programs to indoctrinate its allies. For example, it employed an eccentric South Vietnamese Army officer named Be, who was an expert in Vietnamese mythology, to concoct an elaborate ideology to indoctrinate their own “revolutionary” development cadres in another attempt to imitate the NLF. They forced Vietnam’s peasants to form local militias to combat the VC. These RF/PF militias would suffer the highest casualty rate of all the forces fighting in the war.

Another element of the Phoenix Program involved what were called census grievance teams. In every village the CIA appointed an official who was responsible for interviewing the head of each household every month. Initially the idea was that he would then use some of this information to root out corruption and improve the lives of the people; however since he was invariably a member of the corrupt elite who generally despised the peasants, his real function was to discover who was dissatisfied and turn them in as suspected NLF.

Also involved in the Phoenix Program were US special operations forces. They acted as advisers, sometimes training the PRU teams. Often advisers were sent to PRUs that were already well trained and highly experienced in the ways of covert war. They also lead them on their snatch and grab missions and provided valuable equipment. One fascinating part of the book recounts the early misadventures of the Navy SEALs who had been training for many years but who had never before been in combat. They made a disastrous series of mistakes in their first months in country due to faulty intelligence and general ignorance about Vietnam. It was after teaming up with the PRU and their CIA adviser that they found their role in the war dressed as Viet Cong, hiding during the day, traveling at night, and kidnapping or killed targets provided by the CIA. In today’s world. special operations forces are CIA foot soldiers involved in secret wars in 140 countries. There is no telling how many people they have assassinated.

All these efforts, the enemies lists, torture centers, psychological operations and death squads would, in the end, prove futile. They rarely managed to capture high-level NLF members although they often targeted completely innocent people. They failed to regain control of the countryside. In part, this was because the entire program was misconceived, as they attempted to adopt the Viet Cong tactics while ignoring the VC’s goals. The VC were offering land while the government was attempting to force people off their land into new villages that were little more the prison camps. The VC were acting in Vietnam’s two-thousand-year tradition of battling for national liberation. Throughout the centuries they had suffered repeated conquest by the Chinese and had also successfully fought for their independence repeatedly throwing off Chinese domination.

More recently the struggle against the French had lasted almost a hundred years. They had fought the Japanese during World War 2. America was merely the latest foreign invader, and no amount of propaganda could hide this fact. Another factor in Vietnamese society that made the effort futile was the corruption od America’s allies. Instead of using the program to hunt for communists, they used it as a giant extortion racket.In addition, they knew that if they targeted the high-level NLF members they themselves might be targeted in revenge. They often already knew who the top leaders were but they kept the information from the CIA for fear of the reprisals that might result. In actuality, there was often a sort of secret truce in place. The NLF would allow the South Vietnamese government the illusion of control over an area and, in return, the government wouldn’t interfere with their activities. Often the government ruled by day while at night the NLF ruled. Although 40,000 people were killed by the Phoenix program, the CIA failed to destroy the VCI, and instead, it was the South Vietnamese government which would collapse in the end.

The legacy of the Phoenix program is one of terror, torture, and death. With all the carnage of the Vietnam War it was little noticed, although there was a brief scandal about it when the UN declared the US had a responsibility to ensure South Vietnam adhered to the Geneva Convention on treatment of prisoners, since the US had designed and funded their prison system, one of the worst in the world. Colby was called before Congress where he denied that the Phoenix program was an assassination program and, instead, was merely an effort to coordinate intelligence gathering. He admitted 20,000 people had been killed but that was merely a byproduct. The Phoenix program became was just another brief scandal. Andre Vltchek estimates that 8 million people died as a result of America’s wars in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.

The Phoenix program did not end with those wars just as in a sense it did not begin with them. The tactics of Phoenix are common to all counter-insurgency campaigns and one can read accounts of American actions in the Philippines at the beginning of the 20th century that involve many of the exact same tactics; however, the connection between the Phoenix program and later events is far more concrete and Doug Valentine ends his book with America’s dirty war in El Salvador. The US sent the exact same people involved in the Phoenix program to advise El Salvador on how to wage war on its own peasants. In Nicaragua there was another infamous example. Felix Rodriguez was a PRU adviser in the Phoenix program.

A Cuban exile, he was involved in the Bay of Pigs invasion and the murder of Che Guevara in Bolivia, then went to Vietnam to serve in the Phoenix Program. After the war, he and some of his exile friends did work as hit teams for Miami drug dealers before being sent to advise and train the Contras while helping with their drugs and gun smuggling. Drug dealing had been a major element in the Vietnam War as well (a topic I touched on in my March 2015 Article, ”Wars in Korea and Vietnam”). It was so prevalent in South Vietnam that the CIA often paid their informants in heroin as well as cash. The highest levels of the Vietnamese government were involved in the drug trade.

In nearby Laos much of the war centered over a battle for the opium poppy fields in the Plain of jars and many of the coups actually centered around how to divide the profits from the drug trade. The CIA ran Civil Air Transport (CAT), a front airline later renamed Air America, that smuggled in guns and smuggled out drugs to finance their massive secret army. In Nicaragua personal friend of then-Vice President George H.W. Bush, Felix Rodriguez, was involved in a very similar scheme to fly in guns and fly out drugs to fund the Contras. The Contras then terrorized the populace in a horrific manner in exactly the same way the original CIA counter-terror teams did. Thus, in Central America Phoenix was able to live up to its name rising from the ashes of Vietnam. In El Salvador and Guatemala they advised the government in a massive program of torture and assassination.

Death squads made up a major element in these programs. In Nicaragua, they trained the Contras to engage in terror and assassination that often targeted Nicaraguan health workers and teachers or any government member they could catch, doubtless in an attempt to eliminate the Sandinista “infrastructure.” Of course, they also terrorized anyone else who fell into their hands; men, women and children. The Phoenix program would rise once again after the wars in Central America ended, this time in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In Iraq they explicitly called it the El Salvador solution and they sent people who had helped El Salvador wage its reign of terror to Iraq to train the Shiite Badr brigades. They would use these to wage a massive campaign of kidnapping and torture aimed at destroying the Sunni insurgency. In Syria they would train Wahhabi death squads in an attempt to overthrow the government in a manner similar to the way they used the Contras in Nicaragua, only worse. Again, Syria’s infrastructure has been targeted quite literally as the CIA-backed death squads attempt to destroy food production, hospitals schools, water, electricity and power, even cultural sites. Of course they also try to kill as many people as possible. Like the death squads of the Phoenix program they frequently commit false flag attacks, most famously using chemical weapons in attempt to frame the Assad government. Perhaps the latest site for the rebirth of the Phoenix program is Ukraine where fascist death squads have been unleashed to terrorize the populace, although after a recent power struggle the government plans to bring them into the regular army. Most ominous for Americans, the entire war on terror apparatus mimics the Phoenix program and fusion centers have already been set up to share intelligence on the American population itself, as Doug Valentine himself explained in a brilliant series of articles. The Phoenix program has spread terror across the planet. It will doubtless continue to be reborn again and again so long as America and its allies long war against the planet continues.

I relied on Doug Valentine’s “The Phoenix Program,” a masterpiece made up of hundreds of first-hand accounts analyzing every aspect of the program in depth. It is highly recommended for anyone interested in the Vietnam War, the CIA, and the wars in Central America and the Middle East. I’ve just started his next book, “The Strength of the Wolf” but I can already highly recommend it to anyone wanting to understand the Mafia, the War On Drugs, and the corrupt American Ruling class. His Next book is “Strength of the Pack,” which continues the story. For more on Vietnam I highly recommend “The Perfect War” by James William Gibson, which will be the topic of a future article. There is a great movie inspired by Graham Greene’s classic novel, “The Quiet American” that was actually based on Ed Landsdale.

Today’s post on the mega-bases in Iraq represents but one of the missing stories of the Bush years that TomDispatch has been dedicated to covering. The site’s new book, The World According to TomDispatch: America in the New Age of Empire, just published, is, in essence, a striking history of the missing stories of our mad age, the stories the mainstream media chose to ignore. I urge TomDispatch readers to pick up a copy. It’s a great way to support the site and — if you care to give it to a friend — to introduce others to a source of information that has, for years, been an “antidote to the mainstream media.” If you can, do recommend the book and the site to your private e-lists and suggest, as well, that people consider going to TomDispatch.com to sign up — in the window at the upper right of the main screen — for the regular emails indicating that a new post has gone up. There will be surprises galore this summer as TomDispatch explores the Bush legacy and whether what the Bush administration has embedded in our lives can ever be unbuilt. You can also check out a video in which I discuss the issue of the missing mega-bases in Iraq, now finally in the news, by clicking here.

The Greatest Story Never Told Finally, the U.S. Mega-Bases in Iraq Make the News

It’s just a $$5,812,353 contract — chump change for the Pentagon — and not even one of those notorious “no-bid” contracts either. Ninety-eight bids were solicited by the Army Corps of Engineers and 12 were received before the contract was awarded this May 28th to Wintara, Inc. of Fort Washington, Maryland, for “replacement facilities for Forward Operating Base Speicher, Iraq.” According to a Department of Defense press release, the work on those “facilities” to be replaced at the base near Saddam Hussein’s hometown, Tikrit, is expected to be completed by January 31, 2009, a mere 11 days after a new president enters the Oval Office. It is but one modest reminder that, when the next administration hits Washington, American bases in Iraq, large and small, will still be undergoing the sort of repair and upgrading that has been ongoing for years.

In fact, in the last five-plus years, untold billions of taxpayer dollars have been spent on the construction and upgrading of those bases. When asked back in the fall of 2003, only months after Baghdad fell to U.S. troops, Lt. Col. David Holt, the Army engineer then “tasked with facilities development” in Iraq, proudly indicated that “several billion dollars” had already been invested in those fast-rising bases. Even then, he was suitably amazed, commenting that “the numbers are staggering.” Imagine what he might have said, barely two and a half years later, when the U.S. reportedly had 106 bases, mega to micro, all across the country.

By now, billions have evidently gone into single massive mega-bases like the U.S. air base at Balad, about 60 miles north of Baghdad. It’s a “16-square-mile fortress,” housing perhaps 40,000 U.S. troops, contractors, special ops types, and Defense Department employees. As the Washington Post’s Tom Ricks, who visited Balad back in 2006, pointed out — in a rare piece on one of our mega-bases — it’s essentially “a small American town smack in the middle of the most hostile part of Iraq.” Back then, air traffic at the base was already being compared to Chicago’s O’Hare International or London’s Heathrow — and keep in mind that Balad has been steadily upgraded ever since to support an “air surge” that, unlike the President’s 2007 “surge” of 30,000 ground troops, has yet to end.

Building Ziggurats

While American reporters seldom think these bases — the most essential U.S. facts on the ground in Iraq — are important to report on, the military press regularly writes about them with pride. Such pieces offer a tiny window into just how busily the Pentagon is working to upgrade and improve what are already state-of-the-art garrisons. Here’s just a taste of what’s been going on recently at Balad, one of the largest bases on foreign soil on the planet, and but one of perhaps five mega-bases in that country:

Consider, for instance, this description of an air-field upgrade from official U.S. Air Force news coverage, headlined: “‘Dirt Boyz’ pave way for aircraft, Airmen”:

“In less than four months, Balad Air Base Dirt Boyz have placed and finished more than 12,460 feet of concrete and added approximately 90,000 square feet of pavement to the airfield… Without the extra pavement courtesy of the Dirt Boyz, fewer aircraft would be able to be positioned and maintained at Balad AB. Having fewer aircraft at the base would directly affect the Air Force’s ability to place surveillance assets in the air and to drop munitions on targets… The ongoing flightline projects at Balad AB consist of concrete pad extensions that will provide occupation surfaces for multiple aircraft of various types.”

Or here’s a proud description of what Detachment 6 of the 732nd Expeditionary Civil Engineer Squadron did on its recent tour in Balad:

“‘We constructed more than 25,000 square feet of living, dining and operations buildings from the ground up,’ said Staff Sgt. John Wernegreen… ‘This project gave the [U.S.] Army’s [3rd Squadron, 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment] and Iraqi army [soldiers] a place to carry out their mission of controlling the battlespace around the Eastern Diyala Province.'”

And here’s a caption, accompanying an Air Force photo of work at Balad: “Airmen of the 407th Expeditionary Civil Engineer Squadron pavement and equipment team repair utility cuts here June 11. The team replaced approximately 30 cubic meters of concrete over newly installed power line cables.” And another: “Expeditionary Civil Engineer Squadron heavy equipment operator, contours a new sidewalk here, June 10. Sidewalk repair is being accomplished throughout the base housing area to eliminate tripping hazards.” (The sidewalks on such bases go with bus routes, traffic lights, and speeding tickets — in a country parts of which the U.S. has helped turn into little more than a giant pothole.)

Or how about this caption for a photo of military men on upgrade duty working on copper cable as “part of the new tents to trailers project.” It’s little wonder that, in another rare piece, NPR’s defense correspondent Guy Raz reported, in October 2007, that Balad was “one giant construction project, with new roads, sidewalks, and structures going up… all with an eye toward the next few decades.”

Think of this as the greatest American story of these years never told — or more accurately, since there have been a few reports on a couple of these mega-bases — never shown. After all, what an epic of construction this has been, as the Pentagon built a series of fortified American towns, each some 15 to 20 miles around, with many of the amenities of home, including big name fast-food franchises, PXes, and the like, in a hostile land in the midst of war and occupation. In terms of troops, the President may only have put his “surge” strategy into play in January 2007, but his Pentagon has been “surging” on base construction since April 2003.

Now, imagine as well that hundreds of thousands of Americans have passed through these mega-bases, including the enormous al-Asad Air Base (sardonically nicknamed “Camp Cupcake” for its amenities) in the Western desert of Iraq, and the ill-named (or never renamed) Camp Victory on the edge of Baghdad. Troops have surged through these bases, of course. Private contractors galore. Hired guns. Pentagon officials. Military commanders. Top administration figures. Visiting Congressional delegations. Presidential candidates. And, of course, the journalists.

It has been, for instance, a commonplace of these years to see a TV correspondent reporting on the situation in Iraq, or what the American military had to say about Iraq, from Baghdad’s enormous Camp Victory. And yet, if you think about it, that camera, photographing ABC’s fine reporter Martha Raddatz or other reporters on similar stop-overs, never pans across the base itself. You don’t even get a glimpse, unless you have access to homemade G.I. videos or Pentagon-produced propaganda.

Similarly, last year, the President landed at Camp Cupcake for a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki with reporters in tow. You could see shots of him getting off the plane (just as he does everywhere), goofing around with troops, or shaking hands with the Iraqi prime minister but, as far as I know, none of the reporters with him stayed on to give us a view of the base itself.

Imagine if just about no one knew that the pyramids had been built. Ditto the Great Wall of China. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon. The Coliseum. The Eiffel Tower. The Statue of Liberty. Or any other architectural wonder of the world you’d care to mention.

After all, these giant bases, rising from the smashed birthplace of Western civilization, were not only built on (and sometimes out of bits of) the ancient ruins of that land, but are functionally modern ziggurats. They are the cherished monuments of the Bush administration. Even though its spokespeople have regularly refused to use the word “permanent” in relation to them — in fact, in relation to any U.S. base on the planet — they have been built to long outlast the Bush administration itself. They were, in fact, clearly meant to be key garrisons of a Pax Americana in the Middle East for generations to come. And, not surprisingly, they reek of permanency. They are the unavoidable essence — unless, like most Americans, you don’t know they’re there — of Bush administration planning in Iraq. Without them, no discussion of Iraq policy in this country really makes sense.

And that, of course, is what makes their missing-in-action quality on the American landscape so striking. Yes, a couple of good American reporters have written pieces about one or two of them, but most Americans, as we know, get their news from television and — though no one can watch all the news that flows, 24/7, into American living rooms, it’s a reasonable bet that a staggering percentage of Americans have never had the opportunity to see the remarkable structures their tax dollars have paid for, and continue to pay for, in occupied Iraq.

This is the sort of thing you might expect of Bush-style offshore prisons, or gulags, or concentration camps. And yet Americans have regularly and repeatedly seen what Guantanamo looks like. They have seen something of what Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq looks like. But not the bases. Perhaps one explanation lies in this: On rare occasions when Americans are asked by pollsters whether they want “permanent bases” in Iraq, significant majorities answer in the negative. You can only assume that, as on many other subjects, the Bush administration preferred to fly under the radar screen on this one — and the media generally concurred.

And let’s remember one more base, though it’s never called that: the massive imperial embassy, perhaps the biggest on the planet, being built, for nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars, on a nearly Vatican-sized 104-acre plot of land inside the Green Zone in Baghdad. It will be home to 1,000 “diplomats.” It will cost an estimated $$1.2 billion a year just to operate. With its own electricity and water systems, its anti-missile defenses, recreation, “retail and shopping” areas, and “blast-resistant” work spaces, it is essentially a fortified citadel, a base inside the fortified American heart of the Iraq capital. Like the mega-bases, it emits an aura of American, not Iraqi, “sovereignty.” It, too, is being built “for the ages.”

A Land Grab, American-style

The issue of the mega-bases in Iraq first surfaced barely days after Baghdad had fallen. It was on April 20, 2003, to be exact, and on the front-page of the New York Times in a piece headlined, “Pentagon Expects Long-Term Access to Key Iraq Bases.” Thom Shanker and Eric Schmitt wrote: “American military officials, in interviews this week, spoke of maintaining perhaps four bases in Iraq that could be used in the future,” including what became Camp Victory. The story, and the very idea of “permanent” bases, was promptly denied by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld — then essentially disappeared from the news for years. (To this day, again as far as I know, the New York Times has never written another significant front-page story on the subject.)

Now, however, the bases are, suddenly and startlingly, in the news (and, of course, being written about and discussed on TV as if they had long been part of everyday media analysis). This week, in fact, they hit the front page of the Washington Post, due to protests by Iraqi leaders close to the Bush administration. They were angered by, and leaking like mad about, American strong-arm tactics in negotiations for a long-term Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) that would officially embed American-controlled bases in Iraq for the long-term, potentially tie the hands of a future American president on Iraq policy, and represent a sovereignty grab of the first order. (A typical comment from a pro-Maliki Iraqi politician in that Post piece: “The Americans are making demands that would lead to the colonization of Iraq…”)

The growing Iraqi protests — in the streets, in parliament, and among the negotiators — certainly helped spark coverage in this country. A persistent and intrepid British reporter, Patrick Cockburn of The Independent, helpfully broke the story of Bush administration demands days before it became significant news here.

But most of the credit should really go to the Bush administration itself, which, despite the long-term flow of events in Iraq, still wanted it all. Greed, coupled with desperation, seems to have done the trick. In all the years of the occupation, the officials of this administration have had a tin ear for the post-colonial era they inhabit. It’s never penetrated their consciousness that the greatest story of the twentieth century was the way previously subjected and colonized peoples had gained (or regained) their sovereignty.

The administration indicated this, back in 2003, with its very dream of garrisoning a major, potentially hostile, intensely nationalistic Arab nation in the heart of the oil lands of the planet. That the building of enormous American bases and the basing of troops in relatively peaceful Saudi Arabia after the First Gulf War led to disaster — think: Osama bin Laden — mattered not a whit to top administration officials.

It couldn’t have been clearer just how little they cared for Iraqi sovereignty or pride when L. Paul Bremer III, George W. Bush’s personal representative and viceroy in Baghdad, before officially “returning sovereignty” to the Iraqis in June 2004, signed the infamous (though, in this country, little noted) Order 17. As the law of the land in Iraq, among other things, it ensured that all foreigners involved in the occupation project would be granted “freedom of movement without delay throughout Iraq,” and neither their vessels, nor their vehicles, nor their aircraft would be “subject to registration, licensing or inspection by the [Iraqi] Government.” Nor in traveling would foreign diplomats, soldiers, consultants, security guards, or any of their vehicles, vessels, or planes be subject to “dues, tolls, or charges, including landing and parking fees,” and so on.

When it came to imports, including “controlled substances,” there were to be no customs fees or inspections, taxes, or much of anything else; nor was there to be the slightest charge for the use of Iraqi “headquarters, camps, and other premises” occupied, nor for the use of electricity, water, or other utilities. And all private contractors were to have total immunity from prosecution anywhere in the country. This was, of course, freedom as theft. Order 17 would have seemed familiar to any nineteenth century European colonialist. It granted what used to be termed “extraterritoriality” to Americans. Think of it as a giant get-out-of-jail-free card for an occupying nation.

Now, imagine, that, even after years of disaster, even in a state of discontrol, with unsecured global oil supplies surging toward $$140 a barrel, the Bush administration remained in the same Order 17 frame of mind. They began their negotiations with the Iraqis accordingly. Cockburn (and other journalists subsequently) would report that they were asking for Order 17—style immunity for the U.S. military and all private contractors in the country, as well as the use of up to 58 bases, even though they evidently “only” had 30 major ones in the country. (A leading politician of the Badr Organization claimed that American negotiators were actually pushing for the use of a startling 200 facilities across the country.)

They also evidently insisted on control over Iraqi air space up to 29,000 feet, the right to bring troops in and out of the country without informing the Iraqis, and the right to “conduct military operations in Iraq and to detain individuals when necessary for imperative reasons of security,” again without notification to the Iraqis, no less approval of any sort. They may even have insisted on the freedom to strike other countries from their Iraqi bases, again without consultation or approval. In addition, reported Cockburn, they were attempting to force their Iraqi counterparts to agree to such a deal by threatening to deny them at least $$20 billion in Iraqi oil funds on deposit in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Gulf News reported as well that, under the American version of the agreement, “Iraqi security institutions such as Defense, Interior and National Security ministries, as well as armament contracts, will be under American supervision for ten years.” This was partially confirmed by the Washington Post’s Walter Pincus, who reported on a multi-year contract just awarded to a private contractor by the Pentagon to supply “mentors to officials with Iraq’s Defense and Interior ministries… [who] would ‘advise, train [and] assist… particular Iraqi officials.'”

Had the Bush administration exhibited the slightest constraint, they might have constructed a far more cosmetic version of the permanent garrisoning of Iraq. They might have officially turned the mega-bases over to the Iraqis and leased them back for next to nothing. They could have let the stunning facts they had built on the ground speak for themselves. They could have offered “joint commands” and other palliative remedies (as they are now evidently considering doing) that would have made their long-term sovereignty grab look far less significant — without necessarily being so. But their ability to strategize outside the (Bush) box has long been limited.

Think of them as “the me generation” on steroids, going global and imperial. Or give them credit for consistency. They’re mad dreamers who still can’t wake up, even when they find themselves in a roomful of smelling salts.

Instead, with their secret SOFA negotiations, they’ve attempted to fly under the radar screens of both the U.S. Congress and the Iraqi people. They wanted to embed permanent bases and a long-term policy of occupation in Iraq in perpetuity without letting the matter rise to the level of a treaty. (Hence, no advice and consent from the U.S. Senate.)

Not surprisingly, this episode, too, is threatening to end in debacle. The Iraqi leadership is in virtual revolt. Across the political spectrum, as Tony Karon of the Rootless Cosmopolitan blog has written, the negotiations have forced upon the Iraqis “a kind of snap survey or straw poll… on the long-term U.S. presence, and goals for Iraq” from which the Americans are likely to emerge the losers.

The idea of timetables for American departure is again being floated in Iraq. According to Reuters, “A majority of the Iraqi parliament has written to Congress rejecting a long-term security deal with Washington if it is not linked to a requirement that U.S. forces leave,” and unnamed American officials are now beginning to mutter about no SOFA deal being achieved before the Bush administration leaves office.

The administration’s man in Baghdad, Prime Minister Maliki, has declared the initial U.S. proposal at a “dead end” and has even begun threatening to ask American forces to leave when their UN mandate expires at year’s end. (Though much of this may be bluff on his part, what choice does he have? Given Iraqi attitudes toward being garrisoned forever by the U.S. military, no Iraqi leader could remain in a position of even passing power and agree to such terms. It would be like stamping and sealing your own execution order.)

The Sadrists are in the streets protesting the American presence and their leader has just called for a “new militia offensive” against U.S. forces. The pro-Iranian, but American-backed, Badrists are outraged. (“Is there sovereignty for Iraq — or isn’t there? If it is left to [the Bush administration], they would ask for immunity even for the American dogs.”) The Iranians are vehemently voting no. Opinion in the region, whether Shiite or Sunni, seems to be following suit. The U.S. Congress is up in arms, demanding more information and possibly heading for hearings on the SOFA agreement and the bases. Presidential candidate Barack Obama has insisted that any deal be submitted to Congress, the very thing the Bush administration has organized for more than a year to avoid.

And miracle of all miracles, the mainstream media is finally writing about the bases as if they mattered. Someday, before this is over, all of us may actually see what was built in our names with our dollars. That will be a shock, especially when you consider what the Bush administration has proved incapable of building, or rebuilding, in New Orleans and elsewhere in this country. In the meantime, the President appears headed for yet another self-inflicted defeat.

The White House’s huffing and puffing about Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Syria is just a bunch of hooey. Congress is an independent and coequal branch of our government. Its members can go anywhere they wish to go, and that includes the current House speaker, Pelosi.

As for the Bush administration’s stated desire to ""isolate"" Syria, that is just another of the president’s inside-the-bubble delusions. He seems to think that saying something makes it so. Syria is not isolated. It is a normal country with normal relations, commercial and diplomatic, with most countries in the world. Mr. Bush is not emperor of the world, and most of the world ignores whatever he manages to say.

Furthermore, as many Americans more experienced in foreign policy than the president have advised, the U.S. should be engaged with Syria. Its location between Iraq and Lebanon and its relative power make it a player in the region that cannot be ignored. A basic rule of diplomacy, which the president seems unable to grasp, is that one talks to people with whom one disagrees.

So the exchange of views between the speaker and the president of Syria is a good thing, even if neither convinced the other of anything. The U.S., taking its cue from the Israeli lobby, has branded Hezbollah and Hamas as terrorist organizations. Since they and other organizations have offices in Syria, the U.S. considers that ""state sponsoring of terrorism.""

There again, not everyone in the world considers them as terrorist organizations, even though some members of both organizations have committed acts of terrorism in the past. So, for that matter, has Israel, which generally is credited with being the inventor of the car bomb. So, for that matter, have we, though we call all the thousands of innocent civilians we kill with our bombs ""collateral damage,"" which is one of the more morally obscene euphemisms in this age of propaganda.

At any rate, Speaker Pelosi is as committed to the Israeli lobby as the president, so her visit changed nothing in policy matters. It did, however, pay dividends in good personal relations. We sometimes forget that countries are not abstract concepts, but places run by individual human beings. Personal relationships can make a difference.

Let us not forget, either, that the speaker of the House is second in line to succeed the president. That doesn’t mean that we should have multiple foreign policies, but it does mean that it’s not a bad idea for those members of the House and Senate with an interest in foreign policy to make their own contacts and collect their own information. After all, ""briefings"" by this executive branch have been shown to be unreliable.

Nor is it true that the Constitution puts foreign policy exclusively in the hands of the president. It does no such thing. All ambassadors and all treaties have to be ratified by the Senate. Every penny of funding for anything overseas, including the military, is the responsibility of Congress. In fact, the Constitution assigns several functions involving foreign policy to the legislative branch.

Other than appointing ambassadors and making treaties, both with the advice and consent of the Senate, the only reference to foreign-policy duty assigned to the president by the Constitution is to ""receive ambassadors and other public ministries.""

Clearly, the current president is at odds with the authors of the U.S. Constitution. A simple reading of that document will assure any doubters that the man temporarily occupying the White House is not a monarch, dictator or emperor. And the Constitution is truly the supreme law of the land.

453017,"The annual BRICS summit in Xiamen – where President Xi Jinping was once mayor – could not intervene in a more incandescent geopolitical context.

Once again, it’s essential to keep in mind that the current core of BRICS is “RC”; the Russia-China strategic partnership. So in the Korean peninsula chessboard, RC context – with both nations sharing borders with the DPRK – is primordial.

Beijing has imposed a definitive veto on war – of which the Pentagon is very much aware.

Pyongyang’s sixth nuclear test, although planned way in advance, happened only three days after two nuclear-capable US B-1B strategic bombers conducted their own “test” alongside four F-35Bs and a few Japanese F-15s.

Everyone familiar with the Korean peninsula chessboard knew there would be a DPRK response to these barely disguised “decapitation” tests.

Instant Access to Current Spot Prices & Interactive Charts

So it’s back to the only sound proposition on the table: the RC “double freeze”. Freeze on US/Japan/South Korea military drills; freeze on North Korea’s nuclear program; diplomacy takes over.

The White House, instead, has evoked ominous “nuclear capabilities” as a conflict resolution mechanism.

Gold mining in the Amazon, anyone?

On the Doklam plateau front, at least New Delhi and Beijing decided, after two tense months, on “expeditious disengagement” of their border troops. This decision was directly linked to the approaching BRICS summit – where both India and China were set to lose face big time.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had already tried a similar disruption gambit prior to the BRICS Goa summit last year. Then, he was adamant that Pakistan should be declared a “terrorist state”. The RC duly vetoed it.

Modi also ostensively boycotted the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) summit in Hangzhou last May, essentially because of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

India and Japan are dreaming of countering BRI with a semblance of connectivity project; the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC). To believe that the AAGC – with a fraction of the reach, breath, scope and funds available to BRI – may steal its thunder, is to enter prime wishful-thinking territory.

Still, Modi emitted some positive signs in Xiamen; “We are in mission-mode to eradicate poverty; to ensure health, sanitation, skills, food security, gender equality, energy, education.” Without this mammoth effort, India’s lofty geopolitical dreams are D.O.A.

Brazil, for its part, is immersed in a larger-than-life socio-political tragedy, “led” by a Dracula-esque, corrupt non-entity; Temer The Usurper. Brazil’s President, Michel Temer, hit Xiamen eager to peddle “his” 57 major, ongoing privatizations to Chinese investors – complete with corporate gold mining in an Amazon nature reserve the size of Denmark. Add to it massive social spending austerity and hardcore anti-labor legislation, and one’s got the picture of Brazil currently being run by Wall Street. The name of the game is to profit from the loot, fast.

The BRICS’ New Development Bank (NDB) – a counterpart to the World Bank – is predictably derided all across the Beltway. Xiamen showed how the NDB is only starting to finance BRICS projects. It’s misguided to compare it with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). They will be investing in different types of projects – with the AIIB more focused on BRI. Their aim is complementary.

‘BRICS Plus’ or bust

On the global stage, the BRICS are already a major nuisance to the unipolar order. Xi politely put it in Xiamen as “we five countries [should] play a more active part in global governance”.

And right on cue Xiamen introduced “dialogues” with Mexico, Egypt, Thailand, Guinea and Tajikistan; that’s part of the road map for “BRICS Plus” – Beijing’s conceptualization, proposed last March by Foreign Minister Wang Yi, for expanding partnership/cooperation.

A further instance of “BRICS Plus” can be detected in the possible launch, before the end of 2017, of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) – in the wake of the death of TPP.

Contrary to a torrent of Western spin, RCEP is not “led” by China. Japan is part of it – and so is India and Australia alongside the 10 ASEAN members. The burning question is what kind of games New Delhi may be playing to stall RCEP in parallel to boycotting BRI.

Patrick Bond in Johannesburg has developed an important critique, arguing that “centrifugal economic forces” are breaking up the BRICS, thanks to over-production, excessive debt and de-globalization. He interprets the process as “the failure of Xi’s desired centripetal capitalism.”

It doesn’t have to be this way. Never underestimate the power of Chinese centripetal capitalism – especially when BRI hits a higher gear.

Meet the oil/yuan/gold triad

It’s when President Putin starts talking that the BRICS reveal their true bombshell. Geopolitically and geo-economically, Putin’s emphasis is on a “fair multipolar world”, and “against protectionism and new barriers in global trade.” The message is straight to the point.

The Syria game-changer – where Beijing silently but firmly supported Moscow – had to be evoked; “It was largely thanks to the efforts of Russia and other concerned countries that conditions have been created to improve the situation in Syria.”

On the Korean peninsula, it’s clear how RC think in unison; “The situation is balancing on the brink of a large-scale conflict.”

Putin’s judgment is as scathing as the – RC-proposed – possible solution is sound; “Putting pressure on Pyongyang to stop its nuclear missile program is misguided and futile. The region’s problems should only be settled through a direct dialogue of all the parties concerned without any preconditions.”

Putin’s – and Xi’s – concept of multilateral order is clearly visible in the wide-ranging Xiamen Declaration, which proposes an “Afghan-led and Afghan-owned” peace and national reconciliation process, “including the Moscow Format of consultations” and the “Heart of Asia-Istanbul process”.

That’s code for an all-Asian (and not Western) Afghan solution brokered by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), led by RC, and of which Afghanistan is an observer and future full member.

And then, Putin delivers the clincher; “Russia shares the BRICS countries’ concerns over the unfairness of the global financial and economic architecture, which does not give due regard to the growing weight of the emerging economies. We are ready to work together with our partners to promote international financial regulation reforms and to overcome the excessive domination of the limited number of reserve currencies.”

“To overcome the excessive domination of the limited number of reserve currencies” is the politest way of stating what the BRICS have been discussing for years now; how to bypass the US dollar, as well as the petrodollar.

Beijing is ready to step up the game. Soon China will launch a crude oil futures contract priced in yuan and convertible into gold.

This means that Russia – as well as Iran, the other key node of Eurasia integration – may bypass US sanctions by trading energy in their own currencies, or in yuan. Inbuilt in the move is a true Chinese win-win; the yuan will be fully convertible into gold on both the Shanghai and Hong Kong exchanges.

The new triad of oil, yuan and gold is actually a win-win-win. No problem at all if energy providers prefer to be paid in physical gold instead of yuan. The key message is the US dollar being bypassed.

RC – via the Russian Central Bank and the People’s Bank of China – have been developing ruble-yuan swaps for quite a while now.

Once that moves beyond the BRICS to aspiring “BRICS Plus” members and then all across the Global South, Washington’s reaction is bound to be nuclear (hopefully, not literally).

Washington’s strategic doctrine rules RC should not be allowed by any means to be preponderant along the Eurasian landmass. Yet what the BRICS have in store geo-economically does not concern only Eurasia – but the whole Global South.

Sections of the War Party in Washington bent on instrumentalizing India against China – or against RC – may be in for a rude awakening. As much as the BRICS may be currently facing varied waves of economic turmoil, the daring long-term road map, way beyond the Xiamen Declaration, is very much in place.

373929,"As violence and mayhem surge in Ukraine’s capitol, Kiev, fear is growing that Europe, the United States and Russia may be on a collision course.

Ukraine’s latest crisis began last November after Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych refused to sign an economic cooperation/integration pact with the European Union. Instead, near bankrupt Kiev accepted a Russian offer to supply heavily discounted natural gas and a pledge to buy billions worth of its shaky bonds.

Demonstrations erupted in Kiev and, later, Lvov. The Russian-backed Yanukovich government reacted with brutal police repression. Violence has mounted in recent days, with at least two demonstrators killed and scores injured on both sides. Moscow is making warnings.

This spreading crisis is of utmost geopolitical importance. It will determine the fate of 46 million Ukrainians, Russia’s future, and the stability of Eastern Europe.

Ukrainian and Russian speakers understand one another’s tongue. The problem is more about economic and mentality than language, ethnicity or religion.

Western Ukraine championed the EU deal that would have begun integrating their nation with the rich EU and cast off the heavy hand of Russian political and economic influence. The example of booming EU member Poland inspired Ukraine’s western partisans. Ukraine’s ardent nationalists yearned to make a final break from Russia, which has never really accepted their nation’s 1991 independence from Moscow and has battled Ukrainian nationalists since the 1920’s.

The EU saw the trade pact with Ukraine as part of its grand strategy to keep pushing its borders east, a campaign that deeply alarms Russia.

But eastern Ukraine, notably its industrial Donetsk basin, feared that growing integration with the EU would wipe out their region’s antiquated manufacturing industry, mining, steel firms, commodity companies and chemical plants, causing high unemployment.

Ukraine’s inefficient, post-Soviet companies could not compete with the EU’s powerhouse integrated producers. The same phenomena was seen in former East Germany, where reunion with West Germany doomed most of the East’s rust-belt industries.

Eastern Ukrainians traditionally look to Russia as their cultural foundation. Most Russians regard Ukraine as their historic heartland, the cradle of Russian civilization and ethos.

Outsiders have been pouring gasoline on Ukraine’s fires. European and American politicians beat a path to Kiev to denounce the Yanukovich government, which first took power in 2004-05 by fraudulent elections.

US Senator John McCain and high-ranking US officials have gone to Kiev and called for the ouster of its government. Interestingly, they did not go to Cairo to denounce the increasingly brutal fascist dictatorship of Egypt’s US and Saudi-financed military junta.

Western intelligence services have been stirring Ukraine’s pot, using covert funding and advanced social media techniques to rally opposition to the government. Russia’s intelligence services have also been active, but more discreetly. Opponents of the government have been poisoned, abducted, tortured and even murdered by pro-Yanukovich thugs.

As Ukraine boils, the US has been turning up the heat on Russia and leader Putin, who is being vilified and attacked by the tame western media. The Sochi winter games have also become a target.

How dare those Ruskis use money and gas to bribe Ukraine to stay in Moscow’s orbit? The West is supposed to have a monopoly on such strong-arm tactics.

If violence continues to rend Ukraine, the inevitable question of partition will arise. Just like Czechs and Slovaks, Ukrainians may decide to go separate ways. Unless the hot-headed Ukrainians can reach some stable compromise, divorce may be their only option. Bad, of course, but not as bad as a truly scary confrontation between NATO and Russia over Ukraine.

Unimaginable? Well, few thought about Sarajevo or Bosnia in 1914.

I have been busy since an editorial in The Wall Street Journal summed it up by saying, the most remarkable quality of this healthcare exercise is its reckless disregard for economic and fiscal reality. With the economy still far from a healthy recovery, and the federal fisc already nearly $$2 trillion in deficit, Democrats want to ram through one of the greatest raids on private income and business in American history. The world is looking on, agog, and wondering why the United State seems intent on jumping off this cliff.

Energized into action, I sent out a press release on official letterhead stationary of the Mogambo Supreme Intergalactic News Service (MSINS), wherein was explained to the world that is looking on agog that The reason that the Democrats are doing this moronic, suicidal stupidity is partly because the Democratic Party is the political party of the tragically stupid and the studiously ignorant, and thus they are the people who actually require a big, powerful government telling them what to do and providing for their every need, and mostly because Democrats are the current majority, ruling party in Congress and the White House, and so they have to be the ones trying to achieve the impossible task of preventing the inevitable collapse of the currency and the country, which is the utter ruination caused by rampant fiscal and monetary imbecilities under the auspices of the Congress and the loathsome Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1987 to 2006, respectively, even though the Entire Freaking Economic History Of The World (EFEHOTW) is the same, sorry, sad, stupid story of how long-dead countries and long-dead peoples acted so stupidly with money (although none of them actually ignored their own Constitution’s requirement that money be of silver and gold, which would have easily prevented all of this economic horror).

So, it’s like us stupid Americans are getting what we deserved for not objecting to the evil socialist/commie machinations of another worthless Leftist commie-think Democrat, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who presided over the downturn of the Roaring Twenties (caused by the Federal Reserve creating too much money and credit under too little supervision) with this same kind of fiscal stimulus crap that, which only prolonged the downturn into a Great Depression, and which was also a calamity caused by the Federal Reserve at every step of the way, proving that not only do Earthlings not learn the lessons from the past, they don’t even seem to remember the lessons at all!

To show you the utter impossibility of it, and how you are going to see and hear things that you would never think you would ever hear, cnsnews.com reported that Vice President Joe Biden told people attending an AARP town hall meeting that unless the Democrat-supported health care plan becomes law the nation will go bankrupt and that the only way to avoid that fate is for the government to spend more money.

Mr. Biden, apparently aware that he sounded ridiculous, subsequently said, Now, people when I say that look at me and say, What are you talking about, Joe? You’re telling me we have to go spend money to keep from going bankrupt?’ and he immediately admits, The answer is yes, that’s what I’m telling you.

And don’t think that the Second Amendment is going to help you, because I seem to remember that some famous study found that the 80—20 rule seems to work in the military, too, as 21% of soldiers said that they would obey orders to fire on American civilians as part of a gun confiscation scheme!

So, this brings us neatly to the point of all of this, which is to buy gold right now, because you will not be able to shoot your way out of a situation where 20% of the army is shooting at you, regardless of what the salesman at the gun shop said when he sold you all of this ordnance.

But you will still probably be able to buy your way out by bribing people! I mean, if 20% of the army is willing to kill their fellow Americans as part of an un-Constitutional gun confiscation scheme, they would be too proud and honorable to take a bribe to let you go? Hahaha!

Gold! It’s the answer to so, so many problems! Whee!

Recently by S.H. Blannelberry: Major Pro-Gun Organization Endorses Manchin-Toomey Universal BackgroundCheck Amendment

It's a numbers game at this point. And that magic number is 60. Can Sens. Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) — the architects of a proposal to expand background checks for gun purchases made at gun shows and via the Internet — get the 60 votes they need to ensure their amendment is added to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's baseline gun bill? At this point in time, the answer is: no.

CNN, Washington Post, and POLITICO all have the two lawmakers coming up short.

Both Manchin and Toomey acknowledged that it's going to be an uphill battle to get their peers in the Senate to jump on board with their 49-page amendment.

u201CI'm cautiously optimistic,u201D Toomey told reporters on Monday. u201CWe're not there at the moment but were working on it.u201D

u201CWe're still working it, it's very close,u201D Manchin said. u201CI agree [with Toomey], it's very close.u201D

Manchin then said: u201CI'm talking to everybody.u201D

One of the key selling points of their measure is that it now has the backing of the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, a pro-gun organization with 650,000 members. In terms of membership numbers, the CCRKBA takes a backseat only to the National Rifle Association as far as power and influence are concerned within the gun community.

Manchin indicated that this could be a tipping point for those who are currently on the fence or for those who were initially opposed to expanded background checks.

u201CSome of them [senators] who might not have voted for cloture [in favor of the GOP filibuster] might be more receptive once they see the facts,” Manchin explained. “Now that we have gun groups coming out in support, it really helps us.”

224586,"Recently by Thomas Sowell: Taxes and Politics

Walter Williams fans are in for a treat — and people who are not Walter Williams fans are in for a shock — when they read his latest book, Race and Economics.

It is a demolition derby on paper, as Professor Williams destroys one after another of the popular fallacies about the role of race in the American economy.

I can still vividly recall the response to one of Walter’s earliest writings, back in the 1970s, when he and I were working on the same research project in Washington. Walter wrote a brief article that destroyed the central theme of one of the fashionable books of the time, “The Poor Pay More.”

It was true, he agreed, that prices were higher in low-income minority neighborhoods. But he rejected the book’s claim that this was due to “exploitation,” “racism” and the like.

Having written a doctoral dissertation on this subject, Walter then proceeded to show why there were higher costs of doing business in many low-income neighborhoods, and that these costs were simply passed on to the consumers there.

What I remember especially vividly is that, in reply, someone called Walter “a white racist.” Not many people had seen Walter at that time. But it was also a sad sign of how name-calling had replaced thought when it came to race.

The same issue is explored in Chapter 6 of Race and Economics. The clinching argument is that, despite higher markups in prices in low-income neighborhoods, there is a lower than average rate of return for businesses there — one of the reasons why businesses tend to avoid such neighborhoods.

My own favorite chapter in Race and Economics is Chapter 3, which I think is the most revealing chapter in the book.

That chapter begins, “Some might find it puzzling that during times of gross racial discrimination, black unemployment was lower and blacks were more active in the labor force than they are today.” Moreover, the duration of unemployment among blacks was shorter than among whites between 1890 and 1900, whereas unemployment has become both higher and longer-lasting among blacks than among whites in more recent times.

None of this is explainable by what most people believe or say in the media or in academia. But it is perfectly consistent with the economics of the marketplace and the consequences of political interventions in the marketplace.

Race and Economics explains how such interventions impact blacks and other minorities, whether in housing markets, the railroad industry or the licensing of taxicabs — and irrespective of the intentions behind the government’s actions.

Minimum wage laws are classic examples. The last year in which the black unemployment rate was lower than the white unemployment rate was 1930. That was also the last year in which there was no federal minimum wage law.

The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 was in part a result of a series of incidents in which non-union black construction labor enabled various contractors from the South to underbid Northern contractors who used white, unionized construction labor.

The Davis-Bacon Act required that “prevailing wages” be paid on government construction projects — “prevailing wages” almost always meaning in practice union wages. Since blacks were kept out of construction unions then, and for decades thereafter, many black construction workers lost their jobs.

Minimum wages were required more broadly under the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 and under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, with negative consequences for black employment across a much wider range of industries.

In recent times, we have gotten so used to young blacks having sky-high unemployment rates that it will be a shock to many readers of Walter Williams’ Race and Economics to discover that the unemployment rate of young blacks was once only a fraction of what it has been in recent decades. And, in earlier times, it was not very different from the unemployment rate of young whites.

The factors that cause the most noise in the media are not the ones that have the most impact on minorities. This book will be eye-opening for those who want their eyes opened. But those with the liberal vision of the world are unlikely to read it at all.

Members of

Generation X, born 1962 to 1981, and Generation Y, 1982-2004, are

rallying behind Ron Paul in his run for president. Media commentators

find it odd that people under the age of 40 in the X Generation

and especially voters under age 30 in the Y Generation are so taken

with this unassuming, soft-spoken 76-year-old candidate. Ron Paul

is in the Silent Generation, whose members are now 70 to 87 years

of age (born 1925-1942).

Exit polls

show that Ron Paul won the majority of voters under age 40 in the

Iowa caucus and in the New Hampshire primary. He received 21.4 percent

of the votes in Iowa (first-place Rick Santorum got 24.6 percent)

and came in second in New Hampshire with 22.9 percent of the votes

(first-place Mitt Romney got 39.3 percent). More voters under age

30 chose Ron Paul over the other candidates in the South Carolina

primary and Nevada caucus. He garnered 41 percent of the under 30

vote in Nevada — Mitt Romney got 36 percent; Newt Gingrich, 16 percent;

and Rick Santorum, 7 percent. But only a small minority of older

people has voted for him, as was especially evident in the Florida

Republican primary.

In Generations:

The History of America's Future, 1584-2069 (1991) and The

Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy (1997), William Strauss

and Neil Howe examine the four main generations alive today, including

the Boom (""Baby Boomer"") Generation, born 1943-1961. They

show how these generations mirror ones in the past. They note that

a ""Young Hero and Elder Prophet"" pairing occurs repeatedly

in history, myth, and art, as with Joshua and Moses in the Old Testament,

the Gray Champion in Colonial America, King Arthur and Merlin in

Celtic myth, Tolkien's Frodo and Gandalf, and Luke Skywalker and

Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star

Wars. In Star

Wars, Episode IV, Obi-Wan Kenobi instructs Luke in the ways

of the Force and in Episode VI tells him that killing Darth

Vader (his father) is the only way to destroy the evil Galactic

Empire. And as Joseph Campbell, the American mythologist, notes,

the young hero's close bond with a wise elder is essential to his

ultimate success.

The ""Gray

Champion"" precipitated the Boston Revolt of April 1689, mounted

to protest King James II's increasingly autocratic rule of the British-American

colonies. As Nathaniel Hawthorne describes it in his Twice-Told

Tales, the King-appointed governor of New England marched

British troops through Boston to intimidate the public and quell

any thoughts of colonial self-rule. Hawthorne writes:

“Suddenly,

there was seen the figure of an ancient man, who seemed to have

emerged from among the people, and was walking by himself along

the center of the street, to confront the armed band. He wore

the old Puritan dress, a dark cloak and a steeple-crowned hat,

in the fashion of at least fifty years before…”

This elderly

champion with a manner ""combining the leader and saint""

commanded the soldiers to stop; and ""at the old man's word

and outstretched arm, the roll of the drum was hushed at once, and

the advancing line stood still."" Then, ""inspired by this

single act of defiance, the people of Boston roused their courage

and acted. Within the day, Andros [the governor] was deposed and

jailed, the liberty of Boston saved, and the corner turned on the

colonial Glorious Revolution."" This revolt led to the American

Revolution 85 years later.

Ron Paul is

the Obi-Wan Kenobi and Gray Champion of our time, and the Darth

Vader of our U.S. Empire is the Federal Reserve.

The Federal

Reserve System, with its network of twelve regional private banks,

was established in 1913. The Fed is the country's third central

bank (the first two, established in 1791 and 1816, each lasted for

20 years). The Fed issues token coins and paper dollars, and creates

and transfers unlimited amounts of computer-generated digital money.

Manufacturing money this way, during its 99-year existence the Fed

has destroyed 98.8 percent of the value of the dollar, as calculated

by the Shadow Government Statistics (SGS)-Alternate-Consumer Price

Index (CPI). Using this measure of inflation, a basket of goods

and services that cost $$100 in 1913 now costs $$8,204! (Even the

Bureau of Labor Statistics admits that the dollar has lost 96 percent

of its value since 1913, with that $$100 basket of goods and services

now said to cost $$2303.) Using the more accurate SGS-Alternate-CPI,

the greatest drop in the dollar's value, 95.1 percent, has occurred

since 1971, when president Nixon severed the dollar's last remaining

link with gold, turning it into an effortlessly issued fiat currency.

(A fiat currency is one that has no hard asset backing it such as

gold and derives its value from government edict.) Like a virulent

virus, the Fed has infected the U.S. dollar and made it grow like

a cancer.

The Spanish

Flu pandemic of 1918-1921 killed somewhere between 20 to 40 million

people (including my 22-year-old grandmother and my wife's 23-year-old

grandmother). What the Fed does could result in an equally dire

hyperinflationary economic collapse, similar to what happened in

the Weimar Republic, Austria, and Hungary in the 1920s, Argentina

in 1989, and Zimbabwe. (A practical definition for hyperinflation

is that the country's largest pre-inflation bank note — for the

U.S., the $$100 bill. — becomes worth more as toilet paper, or for

stoking a fire, than as a currency. The currency remains ""current""

but no longer serves as a medium of exchange.)

Dr. Paul prescribes

an Austrian cure for our country's economic problems (see below).

A professor at the University of Vienna, Carl Menger (1840-1921),

founded the Austrian School of Economics, which is named for its

country of origin. (Government officials and economists in Austria

do not follow or endorse ""Austrian Economics."") This branch

of economics studies the action of individuals in the marketplace

and puts forward a subjective theory of value. It explores important

subjects like marginal utility (the

amount of benefit

derived from consuming one additional

unit of

a product

or service,

a concept that debunks the labor theory of value), moral hazard

(where being covered against loss increases risk taking — executives

at the leading investment banking and securities firm, Goldman Sachs,

make a bad, multibillion dollar investment in AIG, and the government,

i.e., U.S. taxpayers, bails them out), and malinvestments

(making the wrong kind of investments, like building too many shopping

malls, encouraged by Fed-set artificially low interest rates). Austrian

economists don't spin their wheels constructing mathematical models

of the economy on a large, ""macroeconomic"" scale, something

that Keynesian economists like to do and which have little bearing

on the real world of human action. In contrast to pump-priming,

big government Keynesianism, Austrian economics stresses the importance

of free markets and a stable currency for economic calculation and

setting prices.

Starting at

a young age, Americans need to learn the basics of Austrian Economics

and appreciate how it restores economic health. But government schools

do not teach Austrian economics or the concomitant Jeffersonian

vision of individual liberty. These subjects make a compelling case

for limited government and are thus politically incorrect.

The primary

role of government schools, where 90 percent of U.S. children are

educated, is to inculcate, in the words of John Calvin, ""the

duty of obedience to rulers."" Government-employed bureaucratic

officials determine what political and economic ideas children are

to be taught. Compulsory government schooling has become a zero-tolerance,

one-size-fits-all, dumbed-down operation that focuses on social

engineering rather than on learning and individual achievement.

James Ostrowski, in Government

Schools Are Bad for Your Kids, puts it this way: ""[The

government school] produces barely literate, historically ignorant,

uncultured lovers of big government."" Sadly, public schools

have evolved into prison-like indoctrination centers that children

and adolescents in the Y Generation currently endure — six and seven

hours a day for thirteen years. For a sobering assessment of what

our nation's public schools have turned into, watch the online documentary

on tagtele.com titled ""War on Kids,"" available HERE.

Nevertheless,

there is reason for hope.

The outpouring

of support by young people for Ron Paul is truly heartening. In

Texas, for example, students at the Hudson Middle School in Hudson

overwhelmingly cast ballots for Ron Paul in the school’s mock GOP

primary, ""after spending weeks studying the candidates’ views

on the issues and watching debates among the hopefuls"" according

to a newspaper account, which reported: ""They liked Paul’s

anti-war stance, as well as his willingness to talk straight and

not attack his opponents to make a point. u2018He’s just like this down-to-earth

dude who just seems like he knows what he’s doing,' seventh-grader

Danielle Heidkamp said.""

Generation

Y members like Danielle will carry the Ron Paul banner forward.

The Y Generation is also named the ""Millennial Generation,""

coming of age as it is at the beginning of a new millennium. This

generation must cope as young adults with the unfolding global financial

crisis. When the Baby Boomer generation was growing up in the 1950s

and 60s U.S. government debt increased $$2.5 Billion a year.

Life was good. Today, with the Millennial Generation coming of age,

U.S. government debt increases by $$2.5 Billion every 16 hours.

After the housing

boom peaked in 2006 and foreclosures began to mount, the so-named

""Millennial Crisis"" began in February, 2007 when the Federal

Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) announced that it would

no longer buy subprime mortgages or mortgage-related securities

(collateralized debt obligations). The Y Generation facing this

crisis today bears some likeness to the GI Generation, born at the

beginning of the last century (1901-1924), who became young adults

during the last big crisis in U.S. history, the Great Depression

and World War II. Strauss and Howe see the GI and Y generations

as both manifesting a ""Hero"" archetype — can-do heroes

and competent pragmatic managers who possess confidence and optimism.

Strauss and

Howe name Generation X the ""13th Generation""

because it is the thirteenth one to call itself ""American,""

beginning with the Awakening Generation born 1701-1723. The Glorious

Revolution (Revolution of 1688) brought this about, which dethroned

King James II and led Parliament to pass the 1869 English Bill of

Rights, called ""An Act declareing the Rights and Liberties

of the Subject and Setleing the Succession of the Crowne.""

This Act enabled people in the American colonies, emboldened by

the Boston Revolt and this Bill of Rights, to see themselves as

distinctly American and not servile British subjects.

Progressives

view human history as a linear process. Beginning with Theodore

Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson early in the last century, progressives

have sought to expand government power and use it to effect what

they consider to be beneficial social, political, and economic change.

They are notable for launching the FED, an income tax, World War

I, Prohibition, and the New Deal. Linear thinkers, which include

politicians, the mainstream media, and CEOs of big corporations,

work to maintain the status quo and their power and wealth. Rather

than progress in a linear fashion, however, human history has a

more seasonal, cyclical nature. As Mark Twain observed, “It is not

worthwhile to try to keep history from repeating itself, for man’s

character will always make the preventing of the repetitions impossible.”

Twain is also alleged to have said something like, ""Although

history doesn't repeat itself, it often rhymes"" (source unknown).

Whatever ""rhyme"" or ""repetition"" that might

have helped bring about the Millennial Crisis, having a linear-thinking

progressive president will only serve to make things worse. That

includes President Obama and all the Republican presidential candidates

except Ron Paul. He alone knows what is really going on, understands

it, predicted it, and knows how best to deal with it.

Not counting

the earlier crisis that caused the colonial Glorious Revolution

and its Boston Revolt (1675-1704), there have been four crises in

American history: the American Revolution (1773-1804), followed

66 years later by the Civil War (1860-1865), 64 years later

by the Great Depression and World War II (1929-1946), and

61 years later by the current Millennial Crisis (2007-?).

Each crisis has been worse than the previous one. There were

25,000 deaths in the American Revolution. Some 600,000 to 800,000

people died in the Civil War. And in World War II 50 to 70 million

people died (civilian and military). In the American Revolution

hyperinflation of the Continental Dollar rendered it worthless,

and in the Civil War the Confederate Dollar suffered the same fate.

In The Fourth

Turning, William Strauss and Neil Howe predicted, in 1997 when

the book was published, that the next period of crisis in our country's

history, the ""Fourth Turning"" (following the first three

crises) which they named the Millennial Crisis, would begin in 8

to 10 years. They were spot-on predicting when it would begin, 10

years later (in 2007), and this is what they say about its course:

""The

risk of catastrophe will be very high. The nation could erupt

into insurrection or civil violence, crack up geographically,

or succumb to authoritarian rule. Thus might the next Fourth Turning

end in apocalypse — or glory. The nation could be ruined, its

democracy destroyed, and millions of people scattered or killed.

Or America could enter a new golden age, triumphantly applying

shared values to improve the human condition. The rhythms of history

do not reveal the outcome of the coming Crisis [the one we are

experiencing now]; all they suggest is the timing and dimension.""

One thing is

certain. This crisis, now in its 6th year, will not be

over anytime soon. How bad it becomes will depend on whether or

not our country heeds the teachings of Ron Paul and his advocates.

Unfortunately,

the establishment media tries to ignore Ron Paul and pretend he

doesn’t exist. Jon Stewart, on The Daily Show, skewers the

media’s talking heads on this score, asking ""How did Ron Paul

become the 13th floor in a hotel?"" in ""John

Stewart Shows How Ron Paul Is Feared By The NWO Mafia Controlled

Mainstream Media,"" which can be seen on YouTube HERE.

But other wiser heads can see and appreciate his true worth.

Bill Buckler,

Captain of the financial newsletter The

Privateer, published in Australia, has this to say about

Ron Paul:

""Dr.

Paul's great and merited attractiveness to a growing number of

admirers has a very simple source. He is that rarest of creatures

— a FREE man. He is beholden to nobody. He has developed his ideas

and his convictions over a long and fruitful life of independent

thinking. He does not compromise. He hones in on the fundamental

issue and principle of any political issue and serves it up without

salt or other u2018seasoning.' He says what he means and he means

what he says. He is the living embodiment of the u2018dream' that

most Americans have long since given up on as they saw it slip

further and further beyond their grasp. He is the only prominent

person who is doing everything he can to turn the non-debate which

masquerades as the u2018mainstream' in the US and global political

economy into something of substance. That, far more than presidency,

is his goal.""

Ron Paul wants

to legalize freedom and have the government stop punishing people

for using the freedom that is rightfully theirs (as long as you,

of course, do not encroach on other persons and their property).

All the other leading candidates who want to be elected president

are pro-big government and seek power. Mitt Romney is Wall Street's

Republican candidate, with the investment banking and securities

firm Goldman Sachs being his biggest contributor. There is little

difference between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, except perhaps

that Romney is even more pro-war than is Obama. I highly recommend

Andrew Napolitano's YouTube video ""Judge

Napolitano What if the Government Has Been Lying to You""

where he portrays Republicans (excluding Ron Paul) and Democrats

as ""two wings of the same bird of prey.""

Ron Paul is

different. As the YouTube video What

Is It About Ron Paul? affirms,

""Once

you get hooked on Ron Paul you can no longer bear to listen to

a man who wants power. You become instantly disgusted whenever

they begin to speak. Before they were just boring, but now they're

revolting. Listening to a Romney, or a Gingrich, or a Bush, or

Obama makes you sick; and you just don't understand how Ron Paul

can get through those debates without getting nauseous. You see

a political veneer in these politicians that is so transparent,

like a ghost flapping its ethereal tongue at you.""

A poster shown

in the video states, ""Once you get hooked on Ron Paul you can

no longer bear to listen to a man who wants power.""

People all

over the world are getting hooked on Ron Paul. A Canadian citizen,

Terry Neudorf, for example, writes this in a blog titled ""Ron

Paul Shakes the World"":

""When

the name Ron Paul is mentioned to my grandchildren, a smile will

creep across their faces, and they will recall, and speak with

excited tones about a time where an idea was born, a message was

spread, and a revolution took hold that shook the world. That’s

the time I’m living in right now. I will treasure every moment.

Thanks for all you do.""

Young Americans

are joining The

Ron Paul Movement, like those manning phone banks to promote

and raise funds for his campaign. (Don't expect Goldman Sachs to

contribute any money to Ron Paul's campaign.) Leaders of the X and

Y Generations allied with Ron Paul are our best hope for the future

— and for coming through the Millennial Crisis without war.

A third world war, with nuclear weapons in play, could well prove

to be even more devastating than was World War II. But even if he

is not elected president, all is not lost. Like Obi-Wan Kenobi,

Ron Paul's spirit and teachings will live on and guide a new generation

of Luke Skywalkers, including his son, X-Generation Rand Paul, to

lead our country safely through this time of economic and social

peril.

The Austrian

Cure for Economic Illness

Dr. Paul's

Austrian treatment for the Millennial Crisis comprises six parts:

1) End

the Fed — close down the central bank. ""Unplug the machinery

of the Fed,"" as Ron Paul puts it in his book End

the Fed (see also the other three books he has written

on government and liberty in ""Suggested Reading"" below).

The market must be free to set interest rates without a central

bank artificially lowering them and inflating the money supply.

Banks should once again exist as free-enterprise institutions

without privileges or bailouts from the state. ATMs, Web-based

systems of funds transfer like PayPal, and online trading can

function perfectly well without a Fed.

2) Restore

sound money to the economy — privatize the country's monetary

system, abolish legal tender laws, and allow the free market to

determine the forms of money it prefers.

3) Lower

taxes and cut government spending — close military bases that

the U.S. maintains in more than 130 countries around the world

and bring the troops home; defund unconstitutional departments

like Education, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, etc.;

abolish the personal income tax.

4) No

bailouts — the economy needs to liquidate all the malinvestments

and mistakes made during the boom in order to be able to move

on and recover from the bust.

5) Allow

prices and wages to fall to levels the market sets — propping

up prices stifles recovery, as the Great Depression proved.

6) Regulate

the government, not private property and markets — entrepreneurs

and investors will only make long-term investments that spur recovery

and boost employment if they feel that their property is secure.

(Fifteen cabinet-level departments control different parts of

the economy, along with 100 federal regulatory agencies that have

produced more than 81,000 pages of regulations, not including

those set by state and local governments.)

734272,"Former FBI director James Comey has a long and telling career; telling much about his rise to FBI director. Although Comey speaks stoically about following the “rule of law”, and “following in the spirit of our founding fathers”, he has shown time and again that his actions speak louder than his words. In recent times, he came under criticism for his handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton. Certainly his announcement in October 2016 that there were new Clinton emails which warranted further investigation was a serious breach of protocol. Coming so close to the elections some say, damaged her chances and could have possibly cost her the nomination. I guess we won’t blame Comey for Hillary’s loss as long as we have Trump and the Russians to blame. In fact in July 2016 Comey came under fire for giving Hillary Clinton a pass explaining there “was no intent.” His decision not to prosecute Clinton even though she was in fact guilty was generous if not curiously suspicious. Mr. Trump was severely disappointed in Comey’s decision.

Why was Comey not following his “rule of law?” It wasn’t the first time he had given a pass to the Clintons. In the mid-1990’s Comey joined the Senate Whitewater Committee as deputy director. The Clintons were being investigated for fraud in connection with a real estate deal. The Clintons were given a pass while two of their closest friends and business partners, Jim and Susan McDougal along with Arkansas Governor Jim Tucker were convicted and received prison time.

Time to buy old US gold coins

In 2002 as a federal prosecutor, Comey took over an investigation into President Bill Clinton’s 2001 pardon of financier Marc Rich who was on the lam. Rich was a former hedge-fund manager who had been indicted on multiple counts of tax evasion, wire fraud and racketeering. Rich at the time of the pardon was a international fugitive who fled to Switzerland. Astoundingly James Comey was the prosecutor in the case against Rich. Then in 2002 he took over the investigation of Clinton’s pardon of the fugitive. There was plenty to investigate and none of it good for Clinton. After Rich’s wife contributed $$450,000 to the Clinton library fund and $$70,000 to Hillary’s Senate campaign the wheels were greased enough to get the pardon put before President Clinton without going through the DOJ review process. After Rich kicked in another million dollars the pardon was set. Again, where was Comey’s rule of law? Was this his interpretation of how the founding fathers intended justice to be carried out? These issues alone should have caused a conflict of interest and prevented Comey from his FBI position.

When Comey prosecuted Martha Stewart he stated “Martha Stewart is being prosecuted not for who she is, but for what she did.” I could say that Comey didn’t prosecute Hillary Clinton because of who she is, not what she did or didn’t do. Another departure from the rule of law was his 2005 endorsement of a memorandum approving the use of enhanced interrogation techniques including waterboarding and sleep The Making of the Pres... Roger Stone Best Price: $$4.24 Buy New $$15.23 (as of 05:15 EST - Details) deprivation for up to 180 hours. Our founding fathers fled England to escape brutality and unjust laws. As we can clearly see James Comey’s high standards of ethics are far removed from reality.

But reality is often quite different from the slippery words that people like Comey want us to believe in. I recently watched a 2014 60 minutes broadcast of an interview that Comey did a year after he joined the FBI. The questions and answers almost seemed rehearsed for maximum Comey benefit. He spoke many times of his unfailing philosophy of rule of law and upholding the Constitution even if it meant disagreeing with the president. He spoke majestically of schooling the new FBI cadets of when the FBI, in the 1960’s, broke all kinds of laws in their obsessive campaign to ruin Martin Luther King Jr. at any cost. He swore up and down that his FBI does not engage in warrant-less phone tapping or surveillance without a court order. He went so far as to say “I believe that Americans should be deeply skeptical of government power. You cannot trust people in power. The founding fathers knew that. This is what I have believed my whole life…in the rule of law and the design of the founders.” Sounds wonderful. Yet we have his actions in reality to weigh against his rhetoric.

In 2005 Comey joined Lockheed Martin as senior vice president and general counsel. Lockheed Martin is the world’s biggest government defense contractor in global aerospace, defense, and security raking in $$36.2 billion in 2015. Lockheed has also committed more fraud than any other contractor. In the 5 years that James Comey acted as Lockheed’s general council and senior vice president, Lockheed had been caught in these cases.

The company called the over billing “inadvertent.”A February 20008 U.S. Government Accountability Office report singled out Lockheed’s F-22A fighter plane in a review of weapons systems plagued by large cost overruns, delays and quality problems. (The following year the Senate voted to terminate the F-22 program.)In June 2008 the Project On Government Oversight made public a 2007 report by the Defense Contract Management Agency that found Lockheed failed to follow 19 of 32 Pentagon guidelines on tracking and managing costs on major weapons programs.In August 2008 Lockheed agreed to pay $$4 million to settle charges that it failed to get permission to sell missiles to the United Arab Emirates and that the company revealed classified information during negotiations with the Persian Gulf nation.In 2009 the Pentagon said that Lockheed would have to pay part of the huge cost overruns on the delay-ridden F-35 fighter jet project.In December 2010 Lockheed agreed to pay $$10.28 million to resolve federal charges that it over billed the Air Force and the Navy for the C-27J tactical aircraft. Comey was paid $$6 million in one year alone from Lockheed. Comey left Lockheed in 2010 but not before convincing Lockheed to become a Clinton Foundation donor and a Clinton Global Initiative member. In 2010 Lockheed won 17 approvals for private contracts from Hillary Clinton’s State Department.

Now, incredibly we learn that Comey let Hillary off the hook after consuming intel that indicated that Attorney General Loretta Lynch had assured the Clinton campaign that she would contain the probe. This ‘intel” turned out to be a forgery although who produced the forgery is unknown. Let’s let the Washington Post take it from there; The Man Who Killed Ken...

“Current and former officials have argued that the secret document gave Comey good reason to take the extraordinary step over the summer of announcing the findings of the Clinton investigation himself without Justice Department involvement.

Comey had little choice, these people have said, because he feared that if Lynch announced no charges against Clinton, and then the secret document leaked, the legitimacy of the entire case would be questioned…

Then on July 5, Comey decided to announce on his own — without telling Lynch ahead of time — that he was closing the Clinton email case without recommending charges against anyone. Aides to Comey said he decided to act alone after Lynch met privately with Bill Clinton for nearly a half-hour on an airport tarmac in Phoenix about a week earlier — and have since said privately the Russian document was also a factor in that decision………

The secret intelligence document has attracted so much attention recently that Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) asked Comey about it during the director’s final public appearance in Congress as FBI director before he was fired.

Comey said that he had spoken with the heads of the congressional intelligence committees about the document privately but that it was too sensitive to discuss it in public.“The subject is classified, and in an appropriate forum I’d be happy to brief you on it,” he told the Senate Judiciary Committee. “But I can’t do it in an open hearing.”

Inn 2013 James Comey became a board member, a director and a Financial System Vulnerabilities Committee member of the London bank HSBC Holdings. HSBC is noted as the world’s most corrupt bank. In 2012 HSBC was fined $$1.9 billion for laundering drug money and violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. In 2015 it paid Swiss authorities $$43 million to settle allegations that it helped the global elite illegally dodge taxes. Yet no one to jail for this drug-related mega-crime. The $$1.9 billion fine was sold by Comey to Loretta Lynch our Attorney General. Lynch used the “deferred prosecutions” under which criminal charges against a firm are set aside in lieu of a fine.

So less than one year after HSBC is hit with the $$1.9 billion fine, and after HSBC is found to be the most corrupt bank in the world, James Comey joins the board of directors at the recommendation of Barrack Obama.

314493,"Recently, US Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin stated, “If China doesn’t follow these sanctions [against North Korea], we will put additional sanctions on them and prevent them from accessing the US and international dollar system.”

By this, he meant that the US would shut China out of the SWIFT system, through which the great majority of international settlements are facilitated. In stating this, the US government is doing nothing less than threatening economic warfare against China, which would unquestionably prove catastrophic to the global economy.

This is astonishingly shortsighted, as the US can no more do without trade with China than China can do without trade with the US. Further, the US will unquestionably pressure its other trading partners (particularly the EU) to endorse and follow the sanctions. This they will not comply with, as it would serve to cut their own economic throats. The relationships between the US and their partners have been wearing thin in recent years, and the present threat against China is very likely to prove to be the final straw. The net effect would be to place the US out on an economic limb, alone.

There may be those who disagree with this premise, under the assumption that, to cut China out of the SWIFT system would destroy China’s ability to make international transactions, forcing them to cave to US demands.

Buy Gold at Discounted Prices

However, China, Russia, and others have seen this day coming and have created their own SWIFT system, world cable network, and world banking system. All that’s needed to kick it all into gear is a major international need to bypass SWIFT. The US government has just provided that need with this threat. There would certainly be teething pains in getting the new system running on a massive scale, but the sudden worldwide need would drive the implementation.

This threat by the US at a time when it’s broke is, in effect, economic suicide.

But, just as the ink is drying on this announcement, the increasingly impetuous US president has cracked a deal with Democrats to permanently abolish the US debt ceiling. As the debt ceiling was the last safeguard in governmental fiscal responsibility, he’s effectively chosen to assure that the US will experience economic collapse.

Again, economic suicide.

It could be argued that the insatiable ego of “The Donald” has driven him to recklessness. Indeed, it’s been his habit, when opposed on anything he wishes to do, to lash out, often creating far more dangerous deals, and saying, effectively, “So, there. I showed you. I’ll do as I please, no matter the damage.” This would suggest that he’s the “Lemming in Chief,” leading the US over a fiscal cliff.

It could also be argued that he is, instead, the “Patsy in Chief,” and is being cleverly played by those who understand his personality weaknesses and repeatedly goad him into unwise decisions that will benefit them, but will ultimately be disastrous for the country.

Either way, what we’re witnessing is a train wreck about to happen, and we’re all, to a greater or lesser extent, on that train.

For many years, in predicting the economic collapse of what was once known as the “free world,” I’ve stated my belief that, whilst we cannot predict the actual dates when the primary events will occur, we can observe the lead-up events—that they’ll increase in both frequency and magnitude the closer we get to the collapse. We’ve recently been in the stage where lead-up events have become weekly. We now appear to be entering the stage where lead-up events become daily. Once we’ve reached this stage, it’s time to fasten our seatbelts.

So, in returning to the image above, is this the end of the world? In a word, no. Those who profess the coming end of the world have been with us for, literally, thousands of years. They’re just as misguided and incorrect today as they’ve always been.

It is true, however, that the world as we know it is about to undergo the most dramatic change that we’ll witness in our lifetimes. Most certainly, we’re presently in the greatest economic bubble the world has ever seen, which assures us that, when it breaks, the damage it causes will be correspondingly great.

But let’s have a second look at the image above. It seems apparent that the three men in it are part of a religious group, recommending that mankind repent. As can be seen on the placard in the middle, “Ye must be cleansed.”

Regardless of any religious connotations to this placard, there’s accuracy in its economic connotations. A collapse is inescapable at this point. The system must be cleansed, much in the way an alcoholic must dry out, or an addict must get the drugs out of his system, before the recovery can begin.

When a crisis of these proportions occurs, it’s not possible to simply acknowledge the collapse, then begin anew the next day. Just like the alcoholic or the addict, we can’t just hit the reset button and start anew. After a collapse, a long and painful process must begin to cleanse the system. In a collapse of the severity of the one we’re facing, the cleansing promises to be quite long and quite painful.

Twenty years ago, in predicting the coming collapse, Harry Schultz predicted, “ten years down; ten years up.” It may well be that his prediction was actually conservative, and we’re now looking at a longer period, as so much additional damage has been done since his prediction.

But, before we leave this topic, it’s important to look at one more factor. Historically, economic wars have a habit of becoming shooting wars. It’s not commonly known that the US war with Japan was precipitated by the US repeatedly putting the squeeze on Japan economically.

President Roosevelt froze Japanese assets in the US. He subsequently succeeded in cutting Japan off from three-quarters of their international trade. Finally, he cut them off from almost 90% of their oil supply.

It could be argued that, at that point, Japan had no choice but to go to war, however badly it might turn out for them.

Could it be that the US government imagines that similar tactics will force China into a war, so that, when that war ends, the US would control China as it did Japan after 1945?

If that’s their intent, the outcome would be unlikely to turn out as they imagine. Although the sabre rattling by US political leaders and retired generals is heard daily on the American news programmes, and the American people are clearly being indoctrinated to believe that war might be necessary, America has never been less ready for a war.

The US is a very different country from what it was in 1941. It does possess a sizable military; however, that military is no match for the combined forces of China and Russia. Moreover, the US is not the industrial giant it was in 1941. Its factories have largely closed and moved overseas. What remains is not sufficient for wartime production. The American people as a whole are heavily in debt and the government itself is broke.

By any standard, the actions being taken by the US are therefore reckless indeed. The end of the world is not nigh, but the end of the world as we know it most certainly is.

If there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, it may lie in the fact that, in previous world wars, there were always countries that simply didn’t take part. They sat it out in peace, while the rest of the world went mad. This is still true today.

216322,"“Much of the middle class was wiped out.”

So said our lawyer in Buenos Aires. He was speaking about the last financial crisis in Argentina.

“Those who understood what was going on didn’t lose a thing. We had our money in dollars or euros…with accounts in Switzerland or Miami. But when the government let the peso fall…and then put on controls to keep you from getting your money out of the bank while it was falling, you can imagine what that did to people. It’s always the middle classes who suffer.”

Argentina is now on the mend. People are working. The streets are crowded and the restaurants are full. The peso, which was once worth as much as a dollar, is worth only one third as much. But in the last year, the peso has gone up. It is the dollar that is falling now.

And who will get wiped out this time?

We have been wondering. The popular illusion is that the Fed will manage the dollar down gently. Little by little, the presses will roll at the U.S. Treasury, dollars will pile up overseas, and the greenback will fall against foreign currencies — and gold — in a landing so cushioned that no one will notice. The dumb foreigners will simply wake up one day and find their U.S. dollars and U.S. bonds worth only a fraction of what they thought they were worth. America’s debtors will get off scot-free.

Could it be that easy and smooth, dear reader?

We venture a little analysis here. In the short run, as Warren Buffett puts it, the markets are a voting machine. People get any goofball result they want. Vox populi; vox dei. But in the long run, markets are weighing machines. The masses are left mute. Sola vox dei loquitur. Only God speaks. Only the fundamentals matter. Only the truth is heard.

America’s middle class has put their faith in various graven images: Ben Franklin, Andrew Jackson, George Washington — dead presidents printed on green paper. They have voted for more and more spending, more and more bread, more and more circuses, more and more foreign wars. They claim to be religious, but they put their faith in the princes and powers of this world — in jobs and credit…in the government. Their voodoo economy is built on magic paper money and directed by witch doctors. Everyone knows they make mistakes, but no one expects them to fall on their faces.

And most of all, America’s middle class counts on houses. Most have few assets beyond their own homes. They have no secrets accounts in Switzerland. They have no euros. They have no Picassos and no Bugattis — or Joe Camels. They have no gold. Even the little they do have — their own homes — are mortgaged more heavily than at any time in the past. A modest decline in prices would leave millions of people upside down — with mortgages higher than their house prices.

Americans used to pay off their mortgages during their working years and then live in their homes, free and clear of debt, during their retirements. Typically, houses were then passed along to the next generation. Now, the house serves a new role. It is supposed to pay the bills from the cradle to the grave. Rather than savings or pensions, people are counting on the rising value of their own homes, not only for current expenses, but for those in retirement, too. Many people take out mortgages on their primary residences, says USA Today, in order to buy vacation houses. When they retire, they intend to live in their second home year round, sell their primary house, and use the proceeds to fund their golden years. Who is going to pay for all those houses left behind? Illegal immigrants from Mexico? Maybe.

Don’t wait too long, is our advice. Remember, voting eventually yields to truth. The truth is, houses are already so expensive in many areas that few people can afford them. And the foreigners look like they could wise up at any moment.

Boom begets bust. A bust in housing would leave a lot of Americans broke at the worst possible time — just when their working years are coming to a close. A real collapse in the housing market would wipe out much of America’s middle class — no matter what happens to the dollar.

“Bay area home sales fall sharply,” says one of yesterday’s ominous headlines.

u2022 “One Million in Britain Fear Bankruptcy,” is the headline story on today’s subway tabloid. Only a million? Surely the number will go up as the down cycle intensifies.

u2022 In America, two headlines suggest worry among top officials: “Fed Chief Urges Caution on Mortgages,” says one, from the Financial Times. The other comes to us from the Wall Street Journal: “Greenspan Expresses Concerns on Derivatives…” Fed chiefs, present and past, are covering their derrieres.

u2022 And in Afghanistan and Iraq, things seem to go from bad to worse…bombings, drugs, murders. We recalled our own words from four years ago: No one goes to war in Afghanistan or Mesopotamia without later regretting it.

u2022 Gold…gold…gold! Gold fever has not yet hit the world’s investors. This is still just the second stage of the bull market. As foretold in this space, gold seems to be in a correction. We looked at a chart this morning that made us think the price should drop between $$650 and $$545 before the correction was over. But what do we know?

All we know is that when the voting stops and the truth-telling begins, gold is likely to be a lot more valuable — in dollar terms — than it is now. We are hoping the price falls below $$650. We will buy more.

u2022 Finally, we are always trying to connect the dots in order to see the big picture. Sometimes we see clearly, but most often, not. We thought we saw a few more connections on Sunday, when listening to our favorite Anglican priest, Peter Mullen, at St. Michaels.

Unlike other economists, we have no illusions about our trade. We cannot tell you how to get rich (other than the old-fashioned way: work hard, save your money, get lucky), nor can we offer any new raz-ma-tazz formula for the U.S. economy. In fact, we are always amused when the question is put to us: “What should the U.S. do to avoid the financial disaster you see coming?”

“Well, nothing,” is our stock reply.

Of course, there is a lot that could be done, but nothing that would actually eliminate the problems. People are too deeply in debt. They, and their elected representatives, have made promises that can’t be kept. To make matters worse, the world economy is evolving. The great advantage enjoyed by the West for the last 300 years is disappearing. The teeter-totter is teetering toward the East. Like it or not, the Western nations are destined — on a relative basis — to get poorer. And their creditors, foreign and domestic, are likely to be stiffed.

Still, government officials and private consumers could cease making the situation worse. They could stop spending money they don’t have, on things they don’t need. Of course, that would trigger the very crisis they hope to avoid. At least it would clear the air and prepare the way for genuine growth and prosperity in the future.

But don’t hold your breath, dear reader. It is not likely to happen. Success is a hard thing to recover from. The success of the American empire — and the American consumer economy — will not be corrected easily. It will, most likely, require full, frontal catastrophe. That is just the way things work. All of life grows, develops, matures, corrupts, degrades, degenerates…and eventually expires. At its peak, an organism — or an institution — is like a man in his 50s at the top of his success — a midlife crisis waiting to happen. It could be a pretty girl in the office, a war in a foreign country, architecture, booze, disease, or just the advancing years: something will bring him down.

“People make a fundamental mistake,” explained Mr. Mullen, or words to that effect. We don’t take notes during a sermon…perhaps we should. “They confuse themselves with God. They think that their own personalities are divine. So, when they do something wrong, and feel bad about it, they don’t think they need to stop doing it. No, they think they need to find a way to feel good about what they are doing.”

That is the problem with modern economics, too. Economists have given up trying to figure out what rules an economy follows. Few seem to have any interest in the rules and even fewer advise people to stick to them. Instead, they make up their own rules as they go along — helping to set interest rates, trade restrictions, fiscal policies, tax levels, all in the guise of managing and guiding the economy. There is no right and no wrong, they say, just technique. They admit that they cannot tell us what price oil will sell for next week…or even tomorrow. Still, they pretend that they can look into the future and improve it before it happens, by adjusting, jiggling, tuning, and manipulating whatever levers are available to them.

We don’t believe it will work. “As ye plant, so shall ye reap,” we recall. If ye cast your seed on barren rock, it will not grow — no matter how many levers ye yank. And if ye sow the wind, well, ye might end up getting a cyclone.

369542,"There was a piece on LRC Friday, August 29, ""Where the Rubber Meets the Sky,"" from the New York Times of August 28. It told of a 78-year-old WW II vet, Bob Bender, who often treks from his home in Mineola, Long Island, to Hangar B at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn to fly small, rubber-powered model airplanes.

The Times article, by Vincent LaForet, is what journalists call a soft feature. It was a beautiful piece of reporting. I think that is true not just because it resonated so strongly with me, but because what was brilliantly conveyed in this story of a dedicated man is what I am calling for this piece the essence of flight.

I am using the term essence in a particular way and will come back to that.

But first to talk about my own reaction. I am a bit older than Mr. Bender, but I know where he is coming from, as people say nowadays. I started building rubber-powered models about 1930, when I too was seven, and kept at it until I went to college. I have since returned to the hobby a few times, but the last time was perhaps more than 20 years ago. Mr. Bender has got me salivating to get started again.

When I built a model for my son when he was about ten, I thought I should get with the latest thing and made a gas-powered job. We went down to the local field and powered up. (This was a first  and as it turned out  last time for me. I had got out of the game when gas power was just coming into it back in the late 30s.)

We let the model take off and watched it climb . . . and climb and climb, and disappear into the void. I had ignored some instructions about installing a fuse to detach the tail after a certain period of flight, which I thought needlessly complicated and mysterious. We never saw that plane again, and my son was understandably not converted. He returned to baseball and fishing.

I realized much later, contemplating this fiasco, that I really did not dig gas engines. Guys my age and some younger ones, all over this country, and in many other nations, make gas-powered model planes of almost incredible finish and sophistication and fly them outdoors at often quite elaborately outfitted airdromes. But I am no longer tempted, as I once was, to get into that end of the hobby.

I did have a brief period after the gas engine disaster of making ""peanuts,"" as the little 12-inch wingspan planes like the ones Bender flies are known to enthusiasts. I never found a proper place to fly them indoors, however, and they don't do well in wind. Now I want to get back into it. Why?

Well, let me try to say. You have ingredients that cost at most a few dollars. (Back in the 1930s it was a matter of pennies.) You need only a few tools. The secret of success is not in money but in craft and understanding something about aerodynamics. It's skill, not power. And success, watching a tiny plane fly around in circles and glide back down to the ground, is somehow a uniquely satisfying experience. One has flown. One has experienced the essence of flight, and that, like the intuition of any essence, is a brush with the eternal, with something that is always the same and always true.

LaForet's piece on Bender includes these lines:

""Mr. Bender allows each [of the youngsters who come to watch him fly his planes] to choose a plane and guides them through winding the [rubber] motors, each with that precise number of turns. Then he walks them to a clear spot and let's them set the planes free. u2018You should see the look on the kids' faces,' he said, u2018when they fly those planes.'""

I know what they are feeling. I can still feel it. They have experienced a genuine marvel, not available, I do believe, to any human beings before the Wrights. It seems to be something a little beyond simple imagination, and I think it goes over into a realm that is difficult for me to write about, probably because my thoughts about it are only half formed.

At this point I have to veer off on a tangent. In recent months I have read a ferocious amount of Internet and periodical commentary and reached the point finally where I could see that my absorption in the war and the D.C. follies was (a) getting in the way of the work I am supposed to be doing, and (b) keeping me more or less constantly upset and furious about the barbarisms and betrayals du jour. I was gagging on the menu of horrors being served up by our leaders and suffering from a sense of total impotence to do a damn thing about any of them.

Not long ago, in a fight-back posture, and without, certainly, giving up on my daily fix of insights from LRC, I decided to start spending a lot more time reading books. You know, the lasting, permanent kind of thing. Not long after that I bumped once again into the phenomenon of the Spanish-American philosopher Santayana.

I have long had a copy of Irwin Edman's excellent 1936 ""Baedeker"" to Santayana's writings, The Philosophy of George Santayana, and have read Santayana's best-selling 1936 novel, The Last Puritan, several times over the last 50 years. This last had a special appeal to my Boston-bred brothers and me because, besides being an intensely moving story of the whole life of a New England youth killed in WW I, it is also an enormously circumstantial, skillful, and ironic send-up of the ""Boston scene,"" which delighted us ""Irish boys"" because it took so unseriously the ponderously serious Boston-Cambridge intellectual scene.

But I do not bring up Santayana here to go off on a critique of him or a mini-biography, but rather to say that I have become at last a halfway serious student of his work. I have bought a whole bunch of his books from the online booksellers and will buy more as funds permit. My present view, which has been developing over recent weeks, is that he is one of the most consistent, honest, readable and profound of 20th century philosophers, as well as one of the most ignored and underrated. I notice that his books sell secondhand at remarkably low prices.

I am working toward trying to grasp his concept of essences, which I know he did not consider existences. That is, he said, essences do not ""exist."" All existence is a flowing, a becoming; whereas essence (I hope I have this right) is true Being. It, as it were, rides over and sums existence, and is, if you will, superior to it, or at least it is fixed and unchangeable, not subject to the universal flux.

Well, as you can plainly see I am not the man, at least not just now, to tell you what George Santayana was saying in his late work, The Realm of Essence. But I had an intuition that I trust, and which constitutes for me what I consider real learning, when I read that piece about model plane builder Bender and reflected on my own experience, vivid to me as I write this.

I am convinced that both in the article and in my recollections, I perceive an essence, the distillation of experience into permanence and unforgettable truth.

369842,"Retired General William Odom, who served as a national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan, spoke last Thursday to the Committee for the Republic in Washington, DC. He described the Iraq War as a historic blunder that the United States should end.

Most of General Odom’s presentation dealt with his new book The Inadvertent Empire published by Yale University Press. This academic book focuses on the role of the United States as an empire. General Odom sees mainly good coming out of the U.S. empire and evidenced this by highlighting how countries want to be part of the empire, share in the wealth we create and the liberal democracy we have developed. He describes the U.S. empire as an ideological empire, not a territorial one. And, unlike other empires in history, it is a money-making not a money losing empire. He sees other institutions, like the WTO, IMF and World Bank as part of the system and notes that they were created by the U.S. Finally, he sees the role of the U.S. military as projecting our power and influence as well as keeping peace among our allies. ""The military umbrella,"" according to Odom, ""is critical to sustaining the empire.""

An example of the positive role the U.S. empire plays is the re-unification of Germany. This was opposed by most of Europe but quiet behind-the-scenes discussions by the United States resulted in the re-unification being accepted. This was good for Europe and the world, but likely would not have occurred without U.S. influence.

According to Odom, ""The biggest threat to the U.S. empire is incompetent U.S. leadership."" This brought the discussion to Iraq, which General Odom has described as a major foreign policy blunder.

He was asked — if President Bush sought your advice on Iraq what would you say in a letter to him. Odom responded that he would tell the President that ""he is losing in Iraq"" and that he ""has made the most strategic foreign policy disaster in U.S. history.""

To get out he suggests the President send Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to Europe ostensibly to talk about Kyoto. In reality, the purpose of the visit would be to say the President wants to meet with you in the Azores to discuss Iraq. Once a meeting is organized the President should tell other foreign leaders ""I screwed up and am pulling out."" He should make the point that the U.S. pulling out could make things worse for the region, Russia and the Far East because terrorists in Iraq will be freed up to go to other countries. The country least likely to be effected by this would be the United States. The President should seek the involvement of these countries in order to minimize the destabilization that might occur. Then he would instruct the Secretary of Defense to develop the logistics for getting out of Iraq.

In order to bring stability to the region the best approach, according to Odom is to ""develop an opening between the United States and Iran."" The conflict with Iran needs to be turned on its head. The President should send a private delegation to Iran to explain our common interests. We should be willing to make concessions on the nuclear bomb — get the nuclear bomb off the table and begin to work with Iran to stabilize the region.

General Odom was asked by an Iraq veteran who had just returned how he knew the war was lost when we have only been there for three years. Odom described the problems in Iraq as beyond our ability to control. The multiple ethnic groups in Iraq, the divisions in Arab culture and their lack of history with a limited state makes ""Iraq one of the hardest places on earth to put in place a liberal democracy."" Odom sees spreading democracy, especially liberal democracy, as very difficult.

When asked how we can bring the president to heel? Odom responded with a question ""how do you impeach the president?"" He went on to express concern about the weakening constitutional balance in the United States.

When it came to Congress, Odom talked about meeting with Rep. Walter Jones (R-NC) where he congratulated Jones for ""taking the lead because then it won’t go to the radical left and we won’t be spitting on our soldiers."" Regarding Rep. Jack Murtha (D-PA), Odom said he ""absolutely agrees with Murtha.""

Odom came to oppose the Vietnam War, not from the left but from the right and he is doing so on Iraq as well. He saw Vietnam as uniting our enemies and failing to contain China. He sees the same thing occurring in Iraq. The unintended consequences of strengthening Iran, undermining U.S. influence in the Middle East and the world and strengthening Osama bin Laden make this a war counterproductive to U.S. interests. He pointed out that like Vietnam the Iraq War was justified by false intelligence comparing the Gulf of Tonkin with the Weapons of Mass Destruction claims. Odom saw three stages in Vietnam: 1961—65 getting into the war; 1965—68 understanding we are not fighting it right, changing approach to a pacification policy; 1968 to end — Vietnamization and phony diplomacy in Paris. He sees us at the end of Phase II in Iraq and beginning Phase III this year. We are seeing the Iraqization of the war and concludes we will see Congress starting to break with the President more and more; and the final conclusion will be the U.S. leaving the ""Green Zone"" much like the U.S. left the embassy in Vietnam.

Odom noted that the United States is ""running out of Army"" and that people underestimate how difficult the Iraq War is on the Army. Indeed, he said ""if we took a referendum among U.S. troops 80 percent would favor leaving. We might be winning tactically, but we are losing strategically."" He predicted a dramatic draw-down by next Christmas with some type of political cover invoked to accomplish it.

Regarding U.S. influence, Odom sees U.S. influence in the region diminishing. Further, according to Odom ""it is important that the U.S. does not become the catalyst for upheavals, we should stop them from spreading not be their cause."" The way to regain our influence would be ""resolving the Israel-Palestinian conflict.""

As to the idea that the Iraq War is a war for oil, Odom described oil as a ""red herring. Oil is a commodity. Our enemies will sell us oil."" However, Odom did see a need to break U.S. addiction to oil. He recommended a $$2 tax on oil to build up a research and development fund for alternative energies. He realized the political leadership may not be able to accomplish this feat.

On the larger issue of American Empire, and the lessons from Iraq. Odom urges that ""the United States should be an empire that acts like a Republic. We should use our power like a teacher on a playground — not like one of the kids."" It is possible that the U.S. empire is history, but he hopes not.

361958,"Fifty years ago, a man named Roger LaPorte, a Catholic Christian, immolated himself at the United Nations in New York City in order to bring to light and to protest the savagery of the Vietnam War. It was a last resort, the desperate act of a young man who was trying to love his brothers and sisters in Vietnam and in the U.S. by laying down his life for them.

What brought him to the point, where he perceived that this is what he wanted to, should do, must do, will forever be unknown in this world. The moral quality of his act before God will also be forever unknown in this world. Did he intend to do God’s will as revealed by Jesus? Was he following his conscience? From whence did he derive the idea that he could be doing God’s will by killing himself to try to save the earthly life of others?

Seven days later on November 9, 1965, Roger LaPorte burned himself to death in front of the Dag Hammarskjold Library at the United Nations. He lived for a short while after and in a state of complete lucidity made what the Catholic priest who administered the Sacrament of Reconciliation to him said was “a perfect confession.” In the only public communication he left explaining his action he said, “I did this as a religious act.” There can be little doubt that this serious, informed and empathic twenty-two year old Catholic young man in 1965—when the overwhelming majority of his fellow Catholics, laity, clergy and hierarchy were in support of the war in Vietnam or just indifferent to the slaughter of Vietnamese men, women and children that was taking place under the auspices of the U.S. military, and when the most prominent and powerful Cardinal in the U.S. was aping Stephen Decatur’s words of nationalistic jingoism, “My country right or wrong,” as justification for Catholics slaughtering by the car loads Vietnamese people, 7000 miles away—found meaning, and hence some of his motivation, in the examples of the prior acts of self-immolation mentioned above.

Yet, the post-mortem histories of the aforementioned four who immolated themselves to help the people of Vietnam are quite different. Thich Quang Duc, is revered by Vietnamese Buddhists as a bodhisattva (saint), the intersection where he set himself afire has a monument and park dedicated to him and his intact heart is preserved as a relic of the spirit of compassion in a glass chalice. Alice Herz, who was also a refugee from Nazi Germany, has a plaza named after her in Berlin. Shingo Shibata, the Japanese philosopher, established the Alice Herz Peace Fund in her memory. Norman Morrison has a road named after him in the Vietnamese city of Da Nang. In Hanoi a street is named after him and the Government of Vietnam has issued a postage stamp in his honor. An HBO film about him has been made and poems and books have been written about him. Roger LaPorte’s charred dry bones lay in the ground of section 1, row 11 of Saint Alphonsus Cemetery in Tupper Lake, NY. —long dead, long gone and long forgotten.

His name is not to be found on any wall of remembrance in Washington, DC. Yet, was he not a casualty of that war? There is no state monument remembering the Lethally Wounded Non-Warriors of War. Nor, have I ever seen in any U.S. Catholic Church the slightest memento that would call to mind the non-warrior victims of U.S. wars—for the purpose of praying for them and their killers. Yet, the overwhelming majority of victims of war are not warriors but rather are non-warriors. Do not they deserve recognition and prayers and help as much as dead warriors or wounded warriors? Roger LaPorte is just another one of the billions of non-warrior victims of war lost to history.

By political and ecclesial necessity and arrangement the warriors, dead or alive, are fawned over, but the billions of non-warriors they maimed and destroyed must be kept out of sight, out of mind and out of memory, lest they reveal the immensity of the evil the honored warriors and their honorable puppet masters have done to fellow human beings, who did them no harm and who intended to do nothing harmful to them. In other words the non-warrior victims of the warrior heroes must be expunged from history, must become as if they never existed, or if they existed were of no worth. The victorious warriors and their controllers carefully manage the memory of the past, so as to assure that in the future the young will experience being used as violent and lethal warriors to be nobly heroic. The non-warrior victims of the honored and obedient warriors and their sting-pullers are consigned to historical oblivion as unworthy of being remembered, as they were unworthy to continue life. To such a community of the dead has Roger Laporte been consigned—“unwept, unhonored and unsung.”

223330,"This morning, TSA searches are #1 on the google news list, no doubt because John Tyner‘s video went viral. Mr. Tyner, thank you for an heroic deed.

Yesterday CBS News reported a poll (taken between November 7 and November 10) in which 8 out of 10 of the 1,137 adults surveyed answered the following question “Yes”:

“Should Airports Use Full-Body X-Ray Machines?”

The 15 percent who disapproved of the x-ray machines adds up to a considerable number of adult Americans, at least 34 million. (That’s 15 percent of the 73 percent of the 310 million Americans who are over the age of 20.) Those who recently approved of imposing even more nationalized health care on Americans claimed to be terribly worried about 40 million uninsured Americans. Are they equally concerned about the 34 million who have no good choices when it comes to air travel?

These machines are new. Their operations at airports are new. Information about their negatives has not spread through the population. Information about their violation of the supreme Law of the Land and about their radiation hazards has not been fully disseminated throughout the population. Almost no information has been publicized or discussed about alternatives to the x-ray machines, such as screening and profiling on the basis of other non-physical information. There has not been a widespread public debate about the use of these machines. Consequently, this poll is at best a snapshot of uninformed opinion.

Poll results depend on how questions are framed. If the question had been put in different ways, the results may have been considerably different. For example:

“Should Airports Inspect the Anus, Vagina, and Genitals (Stuff, Junk, …) of All Travelers?”

“Should Airports Expose All Travelers To The Hazards Of X-Ray Radiation?”

“Should Airline Pilots and Flight Crews Be Excepted from X-Ray Inspections?”

“Should Pregnant Women and Children Under the Age of 10 Be Excepted from X-Ray Inspections?”

“Should Persons with a Valid U.S. Passport Be Excepted from X-Ray Inspections?”

“Should Persons Who Are U.S. Citizens for at Least 15 Years and Who Have No Criminal Records Be Excepted from Airport Inspections?”

“Should Persons Who Are U.S. Citizens for at Least 15 Years and Who Have No Criminal Records and Who Own Homes Be Excepted from Airport Inspections?”

There are a great many ways to screen or profile travelers beforehand without subjecting them to physical inspections of any kind. The preceding questions suggest this.

Racial profiling, which is the bugbear that is raised against screening, is not the only way to screen people. Country of origin is but one natural way for a government to conduct a non-physical screening that doesn’t violate the dignity, rights, and privacy of its citizens.

If a government is going to conduct safety procedures, at least do it in sensible ways. It means that there will be flexibility in the screening. Some people, indeed the great majority of people, will get through easily and without physical invasions of their persons, exposure to x-rays, rights violations, and without an enormous waste of their time and the resources of taxpayers.

It will be a considerable victory for liberty, even if not a full measure is achieved, if the government recognizes officially that different strokes apply to different folks, that is, they start applying their regulations flexibly based on sensible screening. This effectively recognizes a different legality for some, probably most, people than for other people who are subjected to more intensive screening. Equality of treatment for everyone alike, from baby to octogenarian, at the lowest possible level of physical invasion and x-ray machines gives way to a higher degree of liberty, in which many people effectively secede from the one-size-fits-all regulations or effectively nullify the one-size-fits-all regulations.

Poll results change over time as information is released and people revise their opinions. It may be that 8 out of 10 or 9 out of 10 adults will continue to support the use of these machines. So what? Neither polls nor votes make something right or wrong. If right and wrong are determined by majority rule or by authorities who are acting on behalf of majorities or a consensus of the population they represent or rule, then anything can be right or wrong. In particular, the people and authorities may decide to remove all Jews from the country or deport all Afro-Americans or imprison anyone who sells an ounce of marijuana or stop a person from working at less than $$10 an hour or any number of other such measures. Right and wrong cannot possibly be determined by polls and votes. They are found by examination and discovery of law and justice in both general and particular situations.

Within the current spate of news reports appear various opinions that represent the current debate. Let’s examine some of this thinking.

“Robert Thompson, a professor of popular culture at Syracuse University, says society is entering virgin technological and ethical territory. u2018The scanner’s ability to penetrate is metaphorically powerful. It’s invading privacy in all kinds of new ways,’ he told AFP. u2018Balancing that out, there is the other really basic, powerful argument, which is how you remain safe in the sky in the age of tiny weaponry and concealed bombs.'”

Prof. Thompson is correct that scanners invade privacy. On the other hand, he sees the scanners as an essential technology that is necessary to prevent concealed bombs. It isn’t necessary, however. Screening on the basis of who people are can replace it.

And scanners and molestations by physical feel-ups won’t prevent terrorism. Even if all air travel were 100 percent safe, terrorists could easily shift their focus in countless other directions on land and sea. The focus on air travel safety is misplaced. It ignores the substitution effect, whereby terrorists shift to other targets. The same kind of error is made all the time in banning drugs and tracking down drug importers and distributors. They substitute new kinds of drugs and new networks. They raise the ante of bribery, corruption, and assassinations. The terrorists will win if America ties itself in knots over air travel, and then decides to do the same for malls, arenas, marketplaces, games, nightclubs, trains, busses, or wherever people meet in numbers.

Scanners are already being used at courthouses and public buildings. The war on terror has succeeded in transforming police into terrifying creatures of tribulation. Liberty is falling prey to what passes for necessary domestic security, i.e., “homeland security.” There is no security in having a police state. Who is going to hold back those in charge and those with the guns and those with the perverted laws at their backs? Who is going to stop the tyranny and the usurpations?

“TSA Administrator John Pistole says he understands why people are upset, but u2018everybody who gets on a flight wants to be sure the people around them have been properly screened,’ he told lawmakers Tuesday.”

Mr. Pistole begs the question: What is “properly screened”? He assumes that what the TSA is doing is proper. It isn’t. He asserts that there is a demand for this kind of screening. Maybe there is, but does that mean that it is right? Does it mean that everyone must undergo it, even those who object? Are there no reasonable exceptions? Is there no flexibility? Why not?

“Sullenberger said transport authorities should trust pilots and flight attendants, because u2018we’re trusted partners’ who are already u2018thoroughly screened.'”

Mr. Sullenberger is correct. The same logic applies to most Americans. The government already has so much information on Americans that it could probably screen out 95 percent or more travelers on the basis of such information and eliminate scanning and groping for them.

That’s a minimal way to restore a degree of sanity. Liberty entails choice. If the airlines and airports operated in a free market, which means free of TSA procedures, travelers would have a choice of procedures. Those who wanted to pass through x-ray scanners and/or have their breasts and genitals felt could do so. Those who wanted to get secure travel by market-determined means could do so. Each group would pay its own way. The costs would not be socialized through government.

The government, through building an unnecessary empire, has created enemies throughout the world. It is a wonder that the terrorist backlash has not been even greater. It can only grow if the U.S. persists in killing and terrorizing innocent people in multiple foreign locations such as Iraq and Afghanistan.

The government and people of the U.S. have unlawfully extended majority rule, or government by polls, to almost every area of choice that one can think of. The results are in. These extensions have led to economic instability, economic decline, needless warfare, ruination of family, community, and neighborhoods, loss of values, cultural and artistic decline, moral decline, ethical decline, degradation in discourse and thought, and loss of liberty.

X-rays and genital inspections at airports are part of a noxious cloud of government oppression spreading over the land and choking out liberty and choice. The brainlessness and intimidation of TSA officials is part of this ongoing process. It’s a travesty for the TSA to threaten John Tyner with an $$11,000 fine for doing nothing that would harm anyone.

Do we have to put up with such total nonsense like the following?

“The mood among security officials is u2018anger over the way the media is playing this story,’ according to a senior Homeland Security official. u2018You had a dutiful [transportation security officer], someone who works on the front lines to protect this country from a terrorist attack, someone who did everything by the book and according to his training, and he was accosted and verbally abused by a member of the traveling public,’ the official said. u2018The fact that some in the media would hail the traveler as a kind of folk hero is shameful.’

A senior government official thinks that airports are “front lines.” He sounds like George Bush with his “fronts” in the war on terror. He has absorbed the propaganda that completely and now spreads it further. He absolves those doing the prodding, feeling, groping, and x-raying of any measure of guilt or conscience. They are, like good little Nazis, just doing their duty. Then we have a bald-faced lie, which is that Tyner accosted and verbally abused this dutiful worker! No one is supposed to question these procedures. That becomes a crime. To say “Don’t touch me” becomes a crime.

This thinking is a strong signal that the police state is advancing. The barriers that protect ordinary people from unlawful incursions by police and officials have weakened very considerably. They are being penetrated daily.

It is extremely difficult to be fighting against every single incursion by any official anywhere who is stepping over the proper boundary lines that are supposed to be there. This cannot easily be done when he or she has legalities and regulations and courts and guns and the press and sometimes majority opinion to back them up.

Either one supports government tyranny or majority rule tyranny or one does not. If one does not, the alternative is personal and group secessionism from the state’s authority. Let those who want to be ruled by the state suffer the consequences, but let those who wish to secede from its authority do so. That is what liberty, rights, and the freedom of association mean. They mean voluntaryism. This alternative means ending territorial monopoly. Let any person, group, people, community, or society live under its own law, with none claiming any territorial monopoly, which the current states do, under the ruse that they represent a single society, which, it is evident, is a fiction. Let the statists rule themselves with their statist laws to their hearts’ content, but not be able to extend that rule to the non-statists in their midst. Let no one claim rule over any territory, but only live according to the government or non-government of their choice. Let those who desire freedom, peace, and justice live in societies of their choice that fulfill their aims.

The deepest cause of the airport travails is the presumption that a state has a rightful power to force any person within its borders to obey, whether by due process or not. The deepest cause of this and other problems is the territorial grasp of states. That is what ultimately precludes choice among those living within its enforced borders. It is widespread acceptance of that territorial idea that gives rise to the government tyranny. If we rid ourselves of the idea that government must be territorial, we then rid ourselves of government as a monopoly. All governments enforce their monopoly by use of borders and territory. Take that away and they are subject to competition. That breaks their monopoly power. That frees us.

218335,"Martha Stewart has been sentenced to 5 months in prison and two years of supervised release for not telling the truth about a legal stock tip. The only thing she has been found guilty of is lying about a noncrime.

Mrs. Stewart was neither charged with, nor found guilty of, insider trading. Neither she nor her broker had inside information that ImClone’s anti-cancer drug was turned down by federal regulators. They only knew that ImClone’s founder was selling stock.

Savvy investors often sell when executives sell, because they see stock sales by a company’s management as signs of management’s lack of confidence in the company’s future. If the company’s founder didn’t want ImClone’s stock, Martha Stewart didn’t want it herself. She sold.

Neither Mrs. Stewart nor her broker knew ImClone’s founder was selling on the basis of inside information. When news of an investigation came to light, Mrs. Stewart and her broker were unsure of how her sale would be interpreted by prosecutors. The Securities and Exchange Commission has refused to define ""insider trading"" on the grounds that a vague offense surrounded by uncertainty makes it easier to convict defendants who are accused.

Faced with the possibility of being accused of a vague and undefined crime, Mrs. Stewart and her broker stated that they had an agreement to sell when an agreed price was reached. The statement was not made under oath and if false does not constitute perjury.

Prosecutors claim the statement was a stratagem to cover up a stock tip, the legality of which was unclear to Stewart and her broker, and constituted a false statement that ""obstructed"" the investigation. Thus, even though prosecutors uncovered no evidence that Mrs. Stewart had committed a crime, they indicted her for ""obstructing justice"" by not telling them what they say is the truth about the stock sale — even though what the prosecutors say is the truth about the sale does not constitute a crime.

No one knows whether Martha Stewart and her broker told the truth or not, but jurors navely believed the prosecutors. No one — not jury, judge, nor prosecutor — had enough sense or decency to know that it made no difference one way or the other. No one can be guilty of covering up a noncrime.

Meanwhile the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has released its report, which states that the information used by President Bush, Vice President Cheney, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, and Secretary of State Powell to justify the invasion of Iraq was incorrect. Everything Powell told the UN and Bush told the American people was wrong. A war with tens of thousands of casualties was started, if not on the basis of massive outright lies, on the basis of massive orchestrated misinformation.

The deception was so successful that 45% of Americans purport to still believe that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and links to Osama bin Laden.

The senators say the invasion was unjustified, but no person is to blame — only ""the process."" The intelligence information was not correctly collected, analyzed, processed, or reported. Thus, everything got fuddled up and our incompetent government confused myth with reality.

The buck stops nowhere. No one is to be held accountable for a disastrous blunder that has destroyed tens of thousands of people and a half century of US foreign policy, wasted $$200 billion dollars, and made Americans unsafe for decades to come.

If we apply the ""process is guilty"" standard to Mrs. Stewart that is applied to our government leaders, even if she told a lie the fault lies in the vagueness of the insider trading offense. Not knowing what the offense is, people try to defend against being accused of it. Mrs. Stewart is not guilty. The process of the law is guilty for not defining the offense known as insider trading. Judges and jurors are guilty for allowing prosecutors to use vague laws and regulations to indict people.

Meanwhile, the Bush administration refuses to allow contracts that it handed out to cronies to be audited, while imprisoning corporate executives for far less accounting sins.

Meanwhile, the Bush administration has ordered Japan to detain and extradite former world chess champion Bobby Fischer for playing in a 1992 chess match in Yugoslavia. By playing a chess match, the US government claims that Mr. Fischer violated UN sanctions against Yugoslavia, a country charged with provoking warfare because it tried to prevent secession just as Abe Lincoln did.

Are the American people going to reelect a government that prosecutes citizens for noncrimes while excusing itself of war crimes?

Oh, not the ordinary kind of day in, day out kind of scared, constantly dreading both the appearance of childish-yet-pointless alliteration and the coming calamitous collapse of a catastrophic cataclysm caused, pausing for breath, by the completely insane overproduction of cash and credit by the (you guessed it!) evil Federal Reserve, and then winding up, as we see, with both.

At least back in those olden, golden days, a modicum of blessed comfort was once provided by having gold, silver, and sheer firepower at hand, backed up by 911 on the phone.

Except this is a new!improved!vitamin-enriched! kind of scared. A lot more than, shall we say, was usual over the last 35 years of watching, in mounting horror and disbelief, the growing monetary excesses of the evil Federal Reserve, knowing that Never Before In Freaking History (MBIFH) have such insane creations of cash, credit, and the attendant backbreaking debt, and this is the salient point, NOT ended very, very badly!

It’s obviously the stuff of nightmares and double exclamation points. At least for me, anyway, usually replete with vampires sucking my blood, howling banshees noisily chewing my legs off, kids borrowing my car and returning it all banged up and out of gas, etc.

All this escalation of tensions was, I assume, caused by considering that 37% of households have over $15,000 in credit card debt, which, making a minimum payment of 2% of the outstanding balance, means a cool $300 a month of after-tax income disappears out of their pockets, every month for years and years to come. Poof!

Plus they mostly all pay a mortgage or rent every month, plus a car payment and insurance, plus food and energy bills, plus a phone bill, plus connectivity expenses, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus.

That last repetitive-yet-stupid use of “plus, plus, plus, plus, plus” is obviously a clever literary device we writers use to make you quizzically scratch your chin and think to yourself “Hmmm! Either this is just another example of gratuitous repetitive Mogambo gibberish that is so indicative of some kind of bizarre mental disorder, just like his wife and kids always said, or maybe – just maybe! – he really IS a great big giant genius, just like HE always said!”

And so now comes the bad part, which is inflation in prices for all of this plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus stuff. This is the sad, sorry state of being where the majority of people in the USA are living on nominal incomes that haven’t risen for years (especially those on Social Security), and whose real (inflation-adjusted) incomes have done even worse, even when calculated using laughable government statistics of price inflation, which are seriously understated for obvious political reasons.

This means, proved by direct observation just looking around at price tags, for crying out loud, that Things Cost More (TCM), and that actual, in-your-face price inflation for the plus, plus, plus, plus, plus things that you buy is a lot higher than is popularly advertised!

And, thusly, the dismal fact: Mostly nobody has been receiving more dollars as more income, but every dollar they DO have has been losing buying power, experienced as higher prices. Double whammy time! Big time! The whole time!!

Because you are not only good-looking but also the charmingly curious sort, I can see that you are wondering “What is the significance of two exclamation points ending the last sentence, and what is the point of all this boring less-income/higher-prices crap?”

Let me answer your incisive question by asking another question. Namely, “How come so few people buy gold and silver, even though The Wonderful Mogambo (TWM) so graciously, generously and gently motivates them to do so by deliberately sneering at them in cold contempt and rudely insulting their intelligence when they don’t?”

So, why is nobody buying gold and silver as protection and profit from the obvious on-rushing economic calamity caused by the evil Federal Reserve creating such oceans of debt for so, so, so many years? The answer is: Nobody has any spare cash! Prices have risen until they now consume everything! Plus, plus, plus, plus and all!

Like most people everywhere, every freaking dime is used by my family to pay for their frivolities, like (as a recent example) going to the dentist, which, like everything else these days, seems hideously expensive, and now I am supposed to just cough up The Big Bucks (TBB), when the whole thing could have been easily prevented if the stupid kid had just brushed his teeth more. He screws up, but I gotta pay!

So, my Mighty Mogambo Brain (MMB) ingeniously devised a clever plan of self-sufficiency to save a pile of the aforementioned TBB, with which I could use to buy gold and silver: I cheerfully and generously volunteered to take care of his aching tooth, a project easily effected with a pair of ordinary pliers from the garage, and which will – at no additional cost! – provide him with a handy mental reminder in the future about the vital importance of preventive dental hygiene!

I admit that putting him in a headlock and dragging him kicking and screaming towards the garage was a little over-the-top, but you can understand my rage at the injustice here, can’t you? In the end, though, no dice.

So now, to buy an ounce of gold, on top of this, I have to come up with more than $1,200? Are you freaking kidding me? Talk to the dentist! That’s where my money is!

Sadly, this is just one, lonely, measly example of how all this new debt literally created the cash and credit/debt to do many, many things. And, because everything is ultimately connected to everything, this means that the new debt and spending of all this new money did inflationary new things to everything, one thing or another, such as the government borrowing it to spend on one foolish thing or another, or entrepreneurs capitalizing on one foolish idiocy legislated by Congress or another, all designed to stimulate some industry or other.

And mostly by offering tremendous tax-related incentives of one kind or another, or outright transfer payments of one kind or another, to one group or another, at one time or another, inexorably and eventually mostly going to everybody All The Freaking Time (ATFT)!

Inflation everywhere! No wonder I don’t have any freaking money!

I know you feel my pain. And this one heartbreaking tale of the woes of inflation in the money supply leading to inflation in prices should be enough to get you to ask, with a trembling voice and maybe a couple of bucks in your hand, “What, what, what is going to happen, Exalted Mogambo Guru (EMG), whose very name is like music to our ears?”

Having dispensed with the tawdry preliminaries of worshipping at my Mogambo Aromatic Feet (MAF), I would answer “What is going to happen, inquisitive one is inflation in consumer prices, manifested by you getting screwed in one of three main ways. Or in two of three main ways. But probably in all three main ways at once.

“Firstly, the direct approach, which is to sell the same-sized portions but charge a higher price.

“Secondly, sell smaller portions but charge the same price.

“Lastly, or, if you prefer, ‘thirdly’, sell an inferior, watered-down product made with crappy, low-grade, cheaper ingredients, but with the same size and price.”

And with prices going up, incomes stagnating, then the economy collapses, bit by bit.

And if you DON’T think that the ruination of price inflation will happen to you and your stagnant income, then hahaha! I laugh with customary scorn and derision!

While the damnable Federal Reserve and the damnable Congress can levitate some markets, suppress other markets, bail out political liabilities and give more money to more people, they cannot control the resultant inflation in consumer prices caused by all this new cash and credit, which, because there is not more money pay all the higher prices, means that aggregate consumption must fall, and then everything falls down.

By this time, I can hear you pleading “Stop! Stop! I cannot bear being scorned so cruelly, nor my woeful lack of comprehension of even the rudimentary basics of economics so mercilessly mocked! What, what, what must I do?”

Do? Simplicity itself! Do what everybody else in history who succeeded in weathering such economic storms ended up doing: Convert assets into gold and silver bullion.

I mean, it’s so obvious from 2,500 years of history! And that one, teensy bit of glorious historical fact should be interpreted as “Whee! This investing stuff is easy!”

455757,"Bravo Monsieur le president Macron! You have gotten off to a most impressive start. France’s five-year national depression – known as ‘morosité – has lifted and been replaced by a sense that the republic is not doomed after all. In fact, quite the contrary.

France’s new 39-year old president has astounded nearly everyone. Like the silver-tongued Barack Obama, he appeared out of nowhere and captured the imagination of the nation. Like Obama, Macron is accused of being a cat’s paw for the deep state and/or powerful financial interests. Macron used to work for the influential Rothschild bank arranging deals.

Yet Macron, with limited political experience and few evident allies, chose the perfect moment to enter the lists of French politics. The French public was disgusted by its feckless, self-serving political parties of left and right. The economy was mired in stagnation. France’s former role as leader of Europe had become a distant memory.

In love and politics, timing is everything.

Time to buy old US gold coins

Emmanuel Macron declared himself and his new ‘En Marche’ party above politics and dedicated to ending the vitriolic battle between left and right that has wounded France since the 1930’s. French were sick of the left-right bickering and trench warfare of their professional politicians. Americans should take notice. War at the Top of the ...

Amazingly, France’s Socialist and Communist parties pretty much collapsed in the recent presidential election. So too the far right National Front and the center-right Republicans. The defeated Socialist president, Francois Holland, bore heavy responsibility for the Socialist’s rout. His sad sack image and inability to lower unemployment doomed Hollande’s presidency and his party. Poor Hollande, a decent man for a politician, was so unpopular he decided not to run for a second term. Almost everyone was happy to see him go.

Macron’s brand new party took over France’s legislature and, of course, the reins of government. He appointed a cool new prime minister, Eduard Philippe, and many new faces from left and right in the cabinet.

The new president lost no time in announcing that his priority would be to attack France’s biggest problem: its stagnant economy weighed down by over 10% chronic unemployment, belligerent leftwing trade unions, and absurd labor laws.

In fact, Macron threw down the gauntlet to the left: either reform and modernize or face full-scale war. But all of Macron’s predecessors vowed to modernize and reform France’s labor laws. All failed.

Only 8% of France’s work force is unionized, less than Germany, Britain, or the US. Back in the 1950’s, the number was over 30% unionized. However, joint union-management work councils have given the left inordinate power over industry. Unlike Germany, where labor usually cooperates with management, the relationship in France is too adversarial and ideological.

Worse, five powerful unions are recognized by the French government as labor negotiating partners. Except for a leading moderate union, they are dominated by Communists, Trotskyites, and militant socialists, backed by free-enterprise hating academia and the leftist media. These extreme labor groups are concentrated in transportation, telecommunications, power, trucking and food distribution. They also dominate parts of the farm and fishing sectors.

It takes only a few phone calls for these unions to shut France down. The center right may control the government in Paris, but the left controls the streets, highways, airports and metros. Every time Paris and its union foes fight, up go the barricades and roadblocks and the public suffers. Striking is France’s national sport.

Up until now, union blackmail and violence has won almost every confrontation. It’s become a ritual: they make outrageous demands, up go the barricades, and the two sides palaver until government finally gives in to union demands.

The result has been to make France a no-go zone for industry. Labor laws make firing workers and closing plants almost impossible and hugely expensive. One would be crazy to open a manufacturing business in France. Blizzards of government regulations smother enterprise and hand power to bitter government bureaucrats who hate their jobs and their lives.

The net effect of this Marxist miasma has been to deter French firms from hiring, 40% youth unemployment, and a widespread sense of despair in the business community. Even France’s once glorious gastronomy has been degraded by the Socialist’s daft 35-hour work week and high taxes. The majority of French restaurants now use pre-prepared food in portion packs – much like airline meals. This is unforgiveable.

Seizing the moment, Macron plans to reform the labor code by decree. He calls it ‘the Mother of All Reforms.’ The truculent CGT labor union has already called for strikes and demonstrations on 12 September. This will be the beginning of a ‘battle royale.’

Macron has invited US President Donald Trump to Paris for the 14 July Bastille Day celebration. That should be very interesting.

463270,"I don’t know how the Pentagon comes up with names for its military operations, but I do know that its recent name for a certain military operation in Iraq — Operation New Market — dishonors the memory of the 257 brave young cadets from the Virginia Military Institute who defeated U.S. forces at the Battle of New Market in the spring of 1864, especially the 10 cadets who were killed during that battle.

After all, let’s not forget that the VMI cadets at New Market, along with the other Confederate soldiers who were fighting alongside them, were opposing the invasion of their homeland by the U.S. government. As one weary, barefoot Confederate prisoner late in the war responded after being asked by a Union soldier why Confederate soldiers continued fighting so hard, u201CBecause you’re here.u201D

Let’s also not forget that U.S. forces, in retaliation for the role that the VMI cadets had played in routing Union forces at New Market, burned VMI to the ground shortly thereafter.

Let’s also not forget that soon after burning down VMI, and as part of Gen. William T. Sherman’s vow to make the South howl, U.S. military forces under Gen. Philip Sheridan knowingly and intentionally burned homes and farms throughout the Shenandoah Valley, with the specific intent of leaving Virginia women and children homeless and destitute — a war crime of the first magnitude. As Union Sgt. William T. Patterson described the federal mayhem in the Shenandoah Valley, The whole country around is wrapped in flames, the heavens are aglow with the light thereof…. Such mourning, such lamentations, such crying and pleading for mercy [by defenseless women] … I never saw or want to see again.

The Battle of New Market and, for that matter, the U.S. government’s deliberate destruction of the Shenandoah Valley have never been forgotten by VMI or by the people of Virginia — and rightfully so.

After all, let us also not forget that in an era in which government officials are apologizing for the wrongful acts of their predecessors (e.g., radiation experiments on citizens, syphilis experiments on citizens, and forced sterilization of citizens), U.S. officials have yet to apologize for the war crimes committed by their predecessors in the Shenandoah Valley and the rest of the South. Even if one accepts the notion that Lincoln waged his war to free the slaves rather than, as Tom DiLorenzo has documented so well, to prevent secession, such would still not justify the commission of those vicious war crimes.

With respect to Iraq, the U.S. government’s invasion of that country is a war of aggression against an independent country, one that never attacked the United States or even threatened to do so. Moreover, given that the president has waged his war on Iraq without the constitutionally required declaration of war from Congress, the war is illegal under our own form of government.

Therefore, the naming of a military operation in Iraq after the Battle of New Market is an abomination, a disgrace, and a denigration of those brave young VMI cadets in 1864 who fought and died not to invade another country, as the U.S. government has done in Iraq, but instead to resist the invasion of their homeland by the U.S. government.

On Christmas

morning my mother received a Ron Paul t-shirt from my brother-in-law.

The gift made her giddy as she wants to display to her fellow Floridians

her ""Hope for America.""

Less enthusiastic was she about my presents though. After unwrapping

the last one, she turned to me with disappointment and said, ""Oh,

I figured you'd get me a Paul shirt too."" Later that day, she

added to her booty on her own by purchasing another online. The

new one was emblazoned with a quotation from Sinclair Lewis. Sadly,

she rejected my advice to pick up a model proclaiming ""Ron

Paul Fo' Shizzle.""

Mentioning

my mother here may sound like nepotism (or a desire for bigger and

better gifts), but it is not. People like her showcase the importance

and uniqueness of the Paul candidacy. What makes her story compelling

is that she backed the Democratic Party habitually since 1964 which

was the first year she was eligible to vote. Her moving off the

leftist plantation and appreciation for Dr. Paul's libertarian

ethos indicates why this nation needs him…now, more than ever.

Granted, the

last sentence contained loaded words. ""Now more than ever""

is a cliché forever compromised by Richard Nixon using it

as a slogan during his 1972 reelection campaign. Yet the phrase

is topical and draws attention to the statism endemic to both of

our major political parties. Their embrace of steroidal government

is undeniable and all-pervasive. Republican control of Congress

did nothing to alter its course. Indeed, George W. Bush's two terms

in office actually made spending worse.

Stephen Slivinski

explains the extent to which George W. Bush has ramped up the size

of the federocracy. His ""tenure, however, is a return to the

Johnson and Carter philosophy of budgeting: across-the-board increases

in everything. Inflation-adjusted defense spending is higher today

($$440 billion) than it was at the high point of Reagan's defense

buildup ($$399.6 billion) and outstrips Johnson's largest Vietnam

War defense budget (421.3 billion). And real non-defense spending

has grown by a total of 25% during Bush's presidency so far, compared

to 15% over Clinton's entire presidency.""1

In terms of

the real annual growth rate for federal spending, Bush, at 4.9%,

ranks ahead of all other recent presidents with the exception of

Lyndon Baines Johnson.2 Calling the

43rd president a political conservative is a blatant

non-sequitur. In the midst of this Grand Old Spending Party there

has never been a more opportune moment for a man like Ron Paul to

emerge as the champion of the American people.

Saturday's

second

place showing in Nevada forced the mainstream media to take

notice. To my great astonishment, I even heard Brit Hume on Fox

News make a special reference to Dr. Paul's positive result — although

this, in no way mitigates the damage caused by the network's perpetual

condescending and shoddy coverage of him. Some pointed

out that it continued again that night in their post-primary

coverage as well.

Regardless

of his performance out west, to this commentator, he was always

the only option.3 In fact, were it

not for him I would skip going to the polls on Super Tuesday altogether.

I first became aware of him (I am ashamed to admit) only after I

began reading articles at LewRockwell.com

back in 2000. He struck me then, as he does now, as a most rare

form of Republican. He not only had the courage to express his views

but also the courage to defend them. His honesty is what appealed

most to my mother. She asked me if I thought he would run as a third-party

candidate in the general election but then answered her own question

by concluding, ""Nah, if he says he won't run then he won't.

He'd only say it if he meant it.""

Dr. Paul's

response to Reason's

inquiry about the issues he'd advance on the campaign trail is one

to commemorate. He told them, ""Everything I've talked about

for 20 years!"" Quips like that illuminate why several conservative

opinion outlets have dismissed him as being a fringe candidate and

a cult figure. Candor, rectitude, and honor are traits unwelcome

in an age of soundbites. Rather than hire pollsters to help him

determine the nature of his beliefs, he simply states them.

The calumny

which some conservatives have showered upon him indicates just how

threatening his originalist and authentic positions are. He has

to be demeaned because his economic

views would mesmerize the Republican rank-and-file. The last

thing a RINO needs is to be compared to someone who shares the vision

of his constituents. Further, Dr. Paul has resisted Washington's

corruptive and sybaritic influence but the same could never be said

of many of his colleagues.

Nowadays every

politician in power for a cycle or two has a ""flip-flopping""

problem …but not Ron Paul. The doctor, as opposed to Hillary Clinton,

is the only leader whose election promises us a politics of meaning.

Barack Obama would make a wonderful motivational speaker, but his

""audacity of hope"" is nothing but an empty bag of vapor.

Unlike

Dr. Paul he refuses to go into specifics regarding the precise

nature of his plans. Why would he? There is absolutely nothing exceptional

about Obama in terms of ideology. He loves the federocracy and will

continue to back policies anathema

to conservatives should he find himself in the White House. His

claim of being a uniter is spurious, but if Dr. Paul made the same

boast he would be entirely correct. A bevy of leftists now support

him, and they have made their

reasons for doing so known.

If his campaign

causes the far left to internalize the truth of Thomas Jefferson's

edict that

""a government big enough to give you everything you want, is

strong enough to take everything you have"" then his run will

have done America incalculable good. All of us benefit when the

ranks of those who regard government as being an ber-charity are

depleted. Ron Paul supporters understand that enlarging the state

diminishes the liberties of the people. The brighter all of our

collective prospects will be when more leftists accept this eventuality.

The cancerous

growth of the Leviathan has reached stage

four. Its metastasizing force has contaminated every area of

our culture and public square. Our bureaucracies already reflexively

disseminate politically correct views and enforce them whenever

possible. It will not be long before our thoughts are habitually

tested for criminal content by the judiciary — witness the Democratic

Party's ongoing

support for hate crimes legislation.

Left

or right, if you care about the country's future and think liberty

is not a pejorative then Ron Paul is the candidate for you. A vote

for him is a vote America. He embodies what we once were and what

we should always be. Support him in this race and in any race he

runs in the future? Fo' shizzle, my friends, fo' shizzle.

Government. (Nashville: Nelson Current, 2006). p.149 Ibid, 145 I should

note that I published an interview with John Bootie and dubbed

it, ""Teamster for President."" I do think a straight-thinking

normal person like Mr. Bootie — free from PC guilt and who has

actually had to deal with people on a regular basis — would be

far superior to most of the candidates out there. However, Dr.

Paul is a better choice. I was asked if I would work on the Bootie

campaign but I declined the invitation.

As we signed off on Friday, the Saudis were suppressing a u201CDay of Rage in Arabie Gaddafi was mopping up the resistance in Libya And an earthquake and tsunami left thousands dead in Japan.

But that didnt stop the stock market. The Dow rose 59 points.

Now it is Monday. And in all the excitement we kinda lost track But we gots to know

Is the Great Correction over?

We are coming up on the 4th anniversary. Countrywide  one of Americas leading subprime lenders  went broke in 2007. That was when it began. After more than 6 decades of adding to its liabilities, America began to off-load debt.

And now we have to face a critically important question. Is the Great Correction over?

The New York Times tells us that the Great Correction has done its work. By defaulting on their mortgages and cutting spending, theyve got their debt burden down to the lowest level in 6 years:

Total US household debt, including mortgages and credit cards, fell for the second straight year in 2010 to $$13.4 trillion, the Federal Reserve reported Thursday. That came to 116% of disposable income, down from a peak debt burden of 130% in 2007, and the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2004.

With the help of rising stock prices, the decrease in debts put average household net worth at $$505,000 at the end of 2010, up 5.1% from 2009, though still well below a peak of $$595,000 in the second quarter of 2007, before housing prices plunged.

Defaults on mortgages and credit cards played a large role in bringing down household debt, underscoring the extent of the financial distress still afflicting US families. Commercial banks wrote off $$118 billion in mortgage, credit-card and other consumer debt in 2010, the Fed said. Thats over half the total $$208.8 billion drop in household debt, which also includes new mortgages and credit cards.

People are also fixing their finances the hard way, by boosting the portion of their income that they use to pay down debt. The personal savings rate averaged 5.8% in 2010, up from a low of 1.4% in 2005, and back to a level last seen in the early 1990s.

Even as US households reduce their debt, the countrys overall obligations are rising, with weak tax revenues and efforts to stimulate the economy translating into large budget deficits. Total US nonfinancial debt rose 4.8% to $$36.3 trillion, driven largely by a 20% increase in federal debt. Debts of nonfarm, nonfinancial companies rose 5.4% as companies took advantage of low interest rates, but much of that money went to boost their cash coffers, which grew to $$1.9 trillion.

The Times tells the story of one couple who have reduced their debts (Notice to grammarians Yes, it should be a couple that has reduced its debts. But, what the heck? Weve stopped wearing a tie to work. We havent been to church in weeks. And now were going to be a little loose with the language too.):

Since late 2008, he and his wife have slashed their total debt from nearly $$1 million to zero by walking away from the mortgages on four rental properties and paying off two others, all of which lost about half their value in the housing bust. Hes no longer taking up to $$4,000 from his monthly income to pay mortgage interest that the rental income didnt cover.

Instead, he and his wife are fulfilling their goal of building a new $$350,000, four-bedroom home in the Dallas suburb of Lewisville, where they plan to retire. Its a big relief, said Mr. Shah. We went through some rough times, but now Im comfortable and dont have to worry about my retirement.

What a happy story. Heres a couple that improved its balance sheet by $$1 million simply by walking away from mortgages.

Hey, wait a minute. Surely, those debits were someone elses credits. What happened to the million bucks?

Oh, dont play dumb, dear reader. You know how the system works. The mortgages were held by banks. The banks wrote off $$118 billion last year. Other mortgages were included in packages known as derivatives. When they went bad, the banks sold them to the Fed, which included them on its list of assets.

In 2007-2009 the banks faced losses that would have wiped many of them out  including the biggest. But what are the feds for if not to protect half-wits, incompetents and bankers? So, the bankers were allowed to dump their mistakes on the Fed and the public. Zero interest rates then allowed them to restock their bonus pools while force-feeding debt onto the whole society.

You have to marvel at it. It is as though the debt just disappeared. Trillions worth.

And now what? Private households may still be reducing their debt, but the financial sector  with the Fed behind it  is off to the races again. Corporations are going into the marketplace, borrowing money and distributing it to their owners.

The Financial Times:

Economist Andrew Smithers points out that in the first 9 months of last year, non-financial corporations, listed and un-listed, paid out more to shareholders than they made in profits. In other words, they took advantage of record low interest rates to transfer money from lenders and bondholders to shareholders.

Yes, dear reader, the world may not be going back to the naive bubble of the 05-07 years. No one would want it to. Its moving on  to a new bubble. Total bank loans are still below the level of 2009. But theyre going up. Cov-lite loans  those with little protection for the lenders  are coming back. Even interest only loans are making a re-appearance.

Capital is changing hands from the fools to the knaves. Private equity hotshots are borrowing money at low rates so they can pay themselves. The underlying business is weakened with debt; but nobody seems to care.

The other sector of the economy that is leveraging up in a big, big way is government. Here again, the money goes from the fools to the knaves. Government squanders the money in all the usual ways. But lenders still believe they will get it back. Our guess is that the lenders will be wrong. They are making a bad bet. They will not be repaid.

218207,"by Nicholas Monahan

This morning I'll be escorting my wife to the hospital, where the doctors will perform a caesarean section to remove our first child. She didn't want to do it this way  neither of us did  but sometimes the Fates decide otherwise. The Fates or, in our case, government employees.

On the morning of October 26th Mary and I entered Portland International Airport, en route to the Las Vegas wedding of one of my best friends. Although we live in Los Angeles, we'd been in Oregon working on a film, and up to that point had had nothing but praise to shower on the city of Portland, a refreshing change of pace from our own suffocating metropolis.

At the security checkpoint I was led aside for the ""inspection"" that's all the rage at airports these days. My shoes were removed. I was told to take off my sweater, then to fold over the waistband of my pants. My baseball hat, hastily jammed on my head at 5 AM, was removed and assiduously examined (""Anything could be in here, sir,"" I was told, after I asked what I could hide in a baseball hat. Yeah. Anything.) Soon I was standing on one foot, my arms stretched out, the other leg sticking out in front of me la a DUI test. I began to get pissed off, as most normal people would. My anger increased when I realized that the newly knighted federal employees weren't just examining me, but my 7 months pregnant wife as well. I'd originally thought that I'd simply been randomly selected for the more excessive than normal search. You know, Number 50 or whatever. Apparently not though  it was both of us. These are your new threats, America: pregnant accountants and their sleepy husbands flying to weddings.

After some more grumbling on my part they eventually finished with me and I went to retrieve our luggage from the x-ray machine. Upon returning I found my wife sitting in a chair, crying. Mary rarely cries, and certainly not in public. When I asked her what was the matter, she tried to quell her tears and sobbed, ""I'm sorry…it's…they touched my breasts…and…"" That's all I heard. I marched up to the woman who'd been examining her and shouted, ""What did you do to her?"" Later I found out that in addition to touching her swollen breasts  to protect the American citizenry  the employee had asked that she lift up her shirt. Not behind a screen, not off to the side  no, right there, directly in front of the hundred or so passengers standing in line. And for you women who've been pregnant and worn maternity pants, you know how ridiculous those things look. ""I felt like a clown,"" my wife told me later. ""On display for all these people, with the cotton panel on my pants and my stomach sticking out. When I sat down I just lost my composure and began to cry. That's when you walked up.""

Of course when I say she ""told me later,"" it's because she wasn't able to tell me at the time, because as soon as I demanded to know what the federal employee had done to make her cry, I was swarmed by Portland police officers. Instantly. Three of them, cinching my arms, locking me in handcuffs, and telling me I was under arrest. Now my wife really began to cry. As they led me away and she ran alongside, I implored her to calm down, to think of the baby, promising her that everything would turn out all right. She faded into the distance and I was shoved into an elevator, a cop holding each arm. After making me face the corner, the head honcho told that I was under arrest and that I wouldn't be flying that day  that I was in fact a ""menace.""

It took me a while to regain my composure. I felt like I was one of those guys in The Gulag Archipelago who, because the proceedings all seem so unreal, doesn't fully realize that he is in fact being arrested in a public place in front of crowds of people for…for what? I didn't know what the crime was. Didn't matter. Once upstairs, the officers made me remove my shoes and my hat and tossed me into a cell. Yes, your airports have prison cells, just like your amusement parks, train stations, universities, and national forests. Let freedom reign.

After a short time I received a visit from the arresting officer. ""Mr. Monahan,"" he started, ""Are you on drugs?""

Was this even real? ""No, I'm not on drugs.""

""Should you be?""

""What do you mean?""

""Should you be on any type of medication?""

""No.""

""Then why'd you react that way back there?""

You see the thinking? You see what passes for reasoning among your domestic shock troops these days? Only ""whackos"" get angry over seeing the woman they've been with for ten years in tears because someone has touched her breasts. That kind of reaction  love, protection  it's mind-boggling! ""Mr. Monahan, are you on drugs?"" His snide words rang inside my head. This is my wife, finally pregnant with our first child after months of failed attempts, after the depressing shock of the miscarriage last year, my wife who'd been walking on a cloud over having the opportunity to be a mother…and my anger is simply unfathomable to the guy standing in front of me, the guy who earns a living thanks to my taxes, the guy whose family I feed through my labor. What I did wasn't normal. No, I reacted like a drug addict would've. I was so disgusted I felt like vomiting. But that was just the beginning.

An hour later, after I'd been gallantly assured by the officer that I wouldn't be attending my friend's wedding that day, I heard Mary's voice outside my cell. The officer was speaking loudly, letting her know that he was planning on doing me a favor… which everyone knows is never a real favor. He wasn't going to come over and help me work on my car or move some furniture. No, his ""favor"" was this: He'd decided not to charge me with a felony.

Think about that for a second. Rapes, car-jackings, murders, arsons  those are felonies. So is yelling in an airport now, apparently. I hadn't realized, though I should have. Luckily, I was getting a favor, though. I was merely going to be slapped with a misdemeanor.

""Here's your court date,"" he said as I was released from my cell. In addition, I was banned from Portland International for 90 days, and just in case I was thinking of coming over and hanging out around its perimeter, the officer gave me a map with the boundaries highlighted, sternly warning me against trespassing. Then he and a second officer escorted us off the grounds. Mary and I hurriedly drove two and a half hours in the rain to Seattle, where we eventually caught a flight to Vegas. But the officer was true to his word  we missed my friend's wedding. The fact that he'd been in my own wedding party, the fact that a once in a lifetime event was stolen from us  well, who cares, right?

Upon our return to Portland (I'd had to fly into Seattle and drive back down), we immediately began contacting attorneys. We aren't litigious people  we wanted no money. I'm not even sure what we fully wanted. An apology? A reprimand? I don't know. It doesn't matter though, because we couldn't afford a lawyer, it turned out. $$4,000 was the average figure bandied about as a retaining fee. Sorry, but I've got a new baby on the way. So we called the ACLU, figuring they existed for just such incidents as these. And they do apparently…but only if we were minorities. That's what they told us.

In the meantime, I'd appealed my suspension from PDX. A week or so later I got a response from the Director of Aviation. After telling me how, in the aftermath of 9/11, most passengers not only accept additional airport screening but welcome it, he cut to the chase:

""After a review of the police report and my discussions with police staff, as well as a review of the TSA's report on this incident, I concur with the officer's decision to take you into custody and to issue a citation to you for disorderly conduct. That being said, because I also understand that you were upset and acted on your emotions, I am willing to lift the Airport Exclusion Order….""

Attached to this letter was the report the officer had filled out. I'd like to say I couldn't believe it, but in a way, I could. It's seemingly becoming the norm in America  lies and deliberate distortions on the part of those in power, no matter how much or how little power they actually wield.

The gist of his report was this: From the get go I wasn't following the screener's directions. I was ""squinting my eyes"" and talking to my wife in a ""low, forced voice"" while ""excitedly swinging my arms."" Twice I began to walk away from the screener, inhaling and exhaling forcefully. When I'd completed the physical exam, I walked to the luggage screening area, where a second screener took a pair of scissors from my suitcase. At this point I yelled, ""What the %*&$$% is going on? This is &*#&$$%!"" The officer, who'd already been called over by one of the screeners, became afraid for the TSA staff and the many travelers. He required the assistance of a second officer as he ""struggled"" to get me into handcuffs, then for ""cover"" called over a third as well. It was only at this point that my wife began to cry hysterically.

There was nothing poetic in my reaction to the arrest report. I didn't crumple it in my fist and swear that justice would be served, promising to sacrifice my resources and time to see that it would. I simply stared. Clearly the officer didn't have the guts to write down what had really happened. It might not look too good to see that stuff about the pregnant woman in tears because she'd been humiliated. Instead this was the official scenario being presented for the permanent record. It doesn't even matter that it's the most implausible sounding situation you can think of. ""Hey, what the…godammit, they're taking our scissors, honey!"" Why didn't he write in anything about a monkey wearing a fez?

True, the TSA staff had expropriated a pair of scissors from our toiletries kit  the story wasn't entirely made up. Except that I'd been locked in airport jail at the time. I didn't know anything about any scissors until Mary told me on our drive up to Seattle. They'd questioned her about them while I was in the bowels of the airport sitting in my cell.

So I wrote back, indignation and disgust flooding my brain.

""[W]hile I'm not sure, I'd guess that the entire incident is captured on video. Memory is imperfect on everyone's part, but the footage won't lie. I realize it might be procedurally difficult for you to view this, but if you could, I'd appreciate it. There's no willful disregard of screening directions. No explosion over the discovery of a pair of scissors in a suitcase. No struggle to put handcuffs on. There's a tired man, early in the morning, unhappily going through a rigorous procedure and then reacting to the tears of his pregnant wife.""

Eventually we heard back from a different person, the guy in charge of the TSA airport screeners. One of his employees had made the damning statement about me exploding over her scissor discovery, and the officer had deftly incorporated that statement into his report. We asked the guy if he could find out why she'd said this  couldn't she possibly be mistaken? ""Oh, can't do that, my hands are tied. It's kind of like leading a witness  I could get in trouble, heh heh."" Then what about the videotape? Why not watch that? That would exonerate me. ""Oh, we destroy all video after three days.""

Sure you do.

A few days later we heard from him again. He just wanted to inform us that he'd received corroboration of the officer's report from the officer's superior, a name we didn't recognize. ""But…he wasn't even there,"" my wife said.

""Yeah, well, uh, he's corroborated it though.""

That's how it works.

""Oh, and we did look at the videotape. Inconclusive.""

But I thought it was destroyed?

On and on it went. Due to the tenacity of my wife in making phone calls and speaking with relevant persons, the ""crime"" was eventually lowered to a mere citation. Only she could have done that. I would've simply accepted what was being thrown at me, trumped up charges and all, simply because I'm wholly inadequate at performing the kowtow. There's no way I could have contacted all the people Mary did and somehow pretend to be contrite. Besides, I speak in a low, forced voice, which doesn't elicit sympathy. Just police suspicion.

Weeks later at the courthouse I listened to a young DA awkwardly read the charges against me  ""Mr. Monahan…umm…shouted obscenities at the airport staff…umm… umm…oh, they took some scissors from his suitcase and he became…umm…abusive at this point."" If I was reading about it in Kafka I might have found something vaguely amusing in all of it. But I wasn't. I was there. Living it.

I entered a plea of nolo contendere, explaining to the judge that if I'd been a resident of Oregon, I would have definitely pled ""Not Guilty."" However, when that happens, your case automatically goes to a jury trial, and since I lived a thousand miles away, and was slated to return home in seven days, with a newborn due in a matter of weeks…you get the picture. ""No Contest"" it was. Judgment: $$250 fine.

Did I feel happy? Only $$250, right? No, I wasn't happy. I don't care if it's twelve cents, that's money pulled right out of my baby's mouth and fed to a disgusting legal system that will use it to propagate more incidents like this. But at the very least it was over, right? Wrong.

When we returned to Los Angeles there was an envelope waiting for me from the court. Inside wasn't a receipt for the money we'd paid. No, it was a letter telling me that what I actually owed was $$309  state assessed court costs, you know. Wouldn't you think your taxes pay for that  the state putting you on trial? No, taxes are used to hire more cops like the officer, because with our rising criminal population  people like me  hey, your average citizen demands more and more ""security.""

Finally I reach the piece de rsistance. The week before we'd gone to the airport my wife had had her regular pre-natal checkup. The child had settled into the proper head down position for birth, continuing the remarkable pregnancy she'd been having. We returned to Portland on Sunday. On Mary's Monday appointment she was suddenly told, ""Looks like your baby's gone breech."" When she later spoke with her midwives in Los Angeles, they wanted to know if she'd experienced any type of trauma recently, as this often makes a child flip. ""As a matter of fact…"" she began, recounting the story, explaining how the child inside of her was going absolutely crazy when she was crying as the police were leading me away through the crowd.

My wife had been planning a natural childbirth. She'd read dozens of books, meticulously researched everything, and had finally decided that this was the way for her. No drugs, no numbing of sensations  just that ultimate combination of brute pain and sheer joy that belongs exclusively to mothers. But my wife is also a first-time mother, so she has what is called an ""untested"" pelvis. Essentially this means that a breech birth is too dangerous to attempt, for both mother and child. Therefore, she's now relegated to a c-section  hospital stay, epidural, catheter, fetal monitoring, stitches  everything she didn't want. Her natural birth has become a surgery.

We've tried everything to turn that baby. Acupuncture, chiropractic techniques, underwater handstands, elephant walking, moxibustion, bending backwards over pillows, herbs, external manipulation  all to no avail. When I walked into the living room the other night and saw her plaintively cooing with a flashlight turned onto her stomach, yet another suggested technique, my heart almost broke. It's breaking now as I write these words.

I can never prove that my child went breech because of what happened to us at the airport. But I'll always believe it. Wrongly or rightly, I'll forever think of how this man, the personification of this system, has affected the lives of my family and me. When my wife is sliced open, I'll be thinking of him. When they remove her uterus from her abdomen and lay it on her stomach, I'll be thinking of him. When I visit her and my child in the hospital instead of having them with me here in our home, I'll be thinking of him. When I assist her to the bathroom while the incision heals internally, I'll be thinking of him.

There are plenty of stories like this these days. I don't know how many I've read where the writer describes some breach of civil liberties by employees of the state, then wraps it all up with a dire warning about what we as a nation are becoming, and how if we don't put an end to it now, then we're in for heaps of trouble. Well you know what? Nothing's going to stop the inevitable. There's no policy change that's going to save us. There's no election that's going to put a halt to the onslaught of tyranny. It's here already  this country has changed for the worse and will continue to change for the worse. There is now a division between the citizenry and the state. When that state is used as a tool against me, there is no longer any reason why I should owe any allegiance to that state.

And that's the first thing that child of ours is going to learn.

90229,"Recently by Egon von Greyerz: Ignore the Noise

Every day 5,000 tons of silver and 650 tons of gold are traded in the paper market. This is an astonishing 25% of annual production of each metal that is traded daily. Currently there is clearly intervention to hold down the price of gold and silver at every important level. Like all interventions, this one will fail too. The paper market is massively short and would be incapable of delivering even a small fraction of physical gold or silver against their commitments.

So what we are seeing is a short-term correction in the continuous rise in gold and silver against paper money. The correction is likely to be short-lived and eventually lead to new highs.

But investors should not really be concerned. Gold will continue to reflect the escalating deficits and the never-ending money printing by governments.

We know that no government is capable of maintaining any serious level of austerity. This will automatically lead to rejection by the voters and loss of power. So governments worldwide will continue to spend money they dont have and print endless amounts of it. The situation is the same in the US. Neither candidate is capable of taking any measure that will cut the escalating deficits. Since Bernanke became chairman of the Fed in 2006, the Federal Debt has doubled from $8 trillion to $16 trillion! This makes Bernanke the most productive person in history. But this is only the beginning. There is nothing that will change the trend (as shown in the chart above) of rising deficits and rising gold.

There are secret ingredients that don’t show up on labels, like the kidney cells of monkeys, cells from aborted human fetal tissue, and genetically engineered insect viruses.

Adjuvants in vaccines actually weaken our immune systems, making us more susceptible to illnesses.

Heavy metal ingredients pass through the blood-brain barrier and can cause life-long neurological damage.

Undisclosed ingredients given in vaccines to very young children can be at the root of the rash of severe life-threatening allergies that so many people suffer from these days.

The comparison of American vaccine schedules with the schedules of other countries is mind-boggling.

Even though schools will try to tell you otherwise, there are exemptions available in every state for your child to attend school without receiving vaccinations.

There is also input from such luminaries as Paul G King PhD , Mike Adams, Roxie Fiste, Ethan A Huff, Tim O’Shea DC, Cilla Whatcott, Judy Wilyman, Isabella Thomas, MD JD MPH, and Mayer Eisenstein.

Here is the Amazon synopsis of the book:

Vaccination Voodoo uses peer reviewed journal studies, U.S. health agencies information, and other documentation to disclose what’s in vaccines that consumers, unfortunately, do not know. Vaccine ingredients can include such components as Thimerosal, which is 49.6% ethylmercury, aluminum, 2-Phenoxyethanol, formaldehyde/Formalin, polysorbate 80, phenol, antibiotics, gluteraldehyde, MSG, sodium borate, plus a ‘shopping list’ of other neurotoxic chemicals, along with vaccine production media that includes anything from monkey kidney and other animal tissues to genetically engineered insect virus to diploid cells, which are aborted human fetal tissue. Surely, vaccines are not just an antigen and saline water, as many health professionals would have you believe.

Check Amazon for Pricing. vaccination campaigns are being closed down by governments due to so many adverse effects from vaccines–something the U.S. media doesn’t report. Vaccination ‘politics’ and how they affect everyone from the newborn infant to senior citizen become apparent with the author’s candid discussion of what her research of vaccines since the 1980s has uncovered. Many of the myths revolving around vaccines and vaccinations are exposed for what they truly are, public relations and media spin. Vaccination Voodoo, What YOU Don’t Know About Vaccines will open readers’ eyes to information they should know and utilize as part of being informed healthcare consumers.

Some readers may find the author’s writing style to be a bit unusual. This should not influence the decision of whether or not the information contained within is useful. The sources are carefully cited, and the research is very credible.

To make informed choices about the medical care that you and your children receive, rather than just accepting what the doctor tells you, use the data compiled in this book. Check things out thoroughly before allowing your innocent kids to be injected with whatever the physician suggests. There is no reason that you can’t make a second trip if you decide, after reviewing the information, that the benefits outweigh the risks. Don’t be pushed, guilted, or bullied. It is your job to protect your children, and you must have the resources to make informed decisions for them.

Vaccination Voodoo: What YOU Don’t Know About Vaccines is a must-read to combat the disinformation being put forth by the medical industry, Big Pharma, and the government, who are aided and abetted by the mainstream media. I strongly recommend the information contained within this book.

90590,"Have you been at the zoo when the monkeys start rattling their cages and screeching in unison? That about sums up the last 24 hours since the euro zone’s December CPI printed at negative 0.2% versus prior year. Within minutes of the release, brokerage house “economists” were out in force caterwauling that $1 trillion of ECB bond purchases were now in the bag, meaning that gamblers who had ridden the Italian 10-year bond, among other peripheral junk, all the way down from 7.5% to 1.72% would have another bountiful payday.

Then, just to make sure, the rather vague reference in the Fed’s 2pm meeting notes about headwinds emanating from economic weakness in Europe was spun shortly thereafter by the Fed’s PR firm, Hilsenramp & Blackstone, as an explicit instruction to Draghi et. al. to crank up the printing presses to full throttle.

But then about 8pm came the screech that ignited the robo-traders to another 300 Dow point buy-the-dip-rip. The screecher was Charles Evans, who has spent the last 24 years in the central banking cage at the Chicago Fed—–that is, after having been trained previously in the intricacies of global money and capital markets as an assistant professor of economics at the University of South Carolina.

Never mind the upbeat picture of macroeconomic success painted in the meeting notes, said he. To actually allow money market rates to rise from the zero bound, where they have been pinned by the Fed’s big fat thumb for 73 months now, would be a “catastrophe” he averred. Or as one wag noted at that moment,

SPHs are up 17.30 as we write because uber dove and Chicago Fed Prez Evans said the Fed ‘should not rush to hike rates’ and hiking rates would be a ‘catastrophe.’ Algos went berserk and bought SPHs. Ergo, Evans pulled a ‘Bullard’ last night.

A “Bullard” indeed. Since Evans has a vote this year and Bullard doesn’t it is evident that the monkeys are interchangeable. But how else could you describe the babble and gibberish that emanates from the world’s central bankers and the casino economists, strategists and touts who amplify it?

There is overwhelming evidence that the rampant money printing of the past decade or two has done nothing to generate sustainable growth in mainstream living standards and real wealth. Yet the monkeys keep rattling the cage, promising and demanding more ZIRP(and now N-ZIRP) and more fraudulent purchase of government debt with fiat credit congered by their printing presses.

Consider some striking proof of failure. Presumably, the welfare state mecca comprising the EU-19, for example, needs at least some growth in industrial production to sustain the massive state spending, redistribution and borrowing of its member nations. But behold, there has been no net increase in industrial production since 2001.

Eurozone Industrial Production

Now, fourteen years of going net nowhere can’t be due to want of applying the recipe de jour. Rather than stringency, the euro zone experienced a heaping big serving of monetary expansion and inflation during this same period. Even taken at face value, the balance sheet of the ECB is 2.6X its size in 2004——at a time when EU-19 industrial production was exactly at today’s level.

So the central bank balance sheet grew at a 10.5% CAGR over the last decade, while industrial production expanded at a 0.0% CAGR. Double digit annual money printing is not enough?

Well, actually, not even 15% annual money printing was sufficient to lift European industrial production off the flat-line. The truth of the matter is that the ECB balance sheet has not actually retracted at all from its euro 3.1 trillion peak in 2012. The trillion euro difference is just parked off balance sheet in hedge funds and the trading accounts of trend-following European banks who took Draghi’s “whatever it takes” ukase as a bankable commitment.

Why not rent out your balance sheet to the ECB in order to make enormous windfall gains on the soaring bonds of the bankrupt peripherals? And then to complete this larcenous romp, fund the bonds with zero cost deposits mandated from Frankfurt, while keeping your trigger finger on the “sell” button for the day when Draghi is forced to make good?

Stated differently, that’s what all the screeching was about yesterday. It was just a proclamation that the balance sheet of the ECB is actually $3.5 trillion at today’s FX rate, and that the balance sheet renters were much obliged for the negative CPI print.

Likewise, it can’t be said that the euro zone’s flat-lining industrial production was caused by “low-flation”, let alone negative inflation. In fact, the EU’s harmonized CPI index printed at 88.58 in January 2000 and stood at 117.7 in December 2014. That computes out to exactly a 1.9% CAGR. You can’t get any closer to the ECB’s arbitrary 2.0% inflation target than that, yet where’s the beef? Why hasn’t the elixir of prodigious money printing and ample inflation resulted in any net growth in euro zone industrial output at all?

Eurozone Harmonized CPI

Actually, the real picture is much worse. Nearly every EU-19 country has lower industrial production today than it did in the year 2000 except Germany; and much of the latter’s gain was due to the explosion of engineered machinery and other high-value exports to China’s building boom. Current industrial production in France, for example, is still 12% below its turn of the century level. In the case of Italy, production is down by 24%.

There is a reason for Europe’s economic stagnation, of course, and it has nothing to due with insufficient money printing enthusiasm at the ECB. The culprit is “peak debt” and the relentless expansion of the state’s barriers to enterprise, investment and growth.

In the case of the former, the graph below needs no elaboration. During the two decades ending in 2012, and especially upon the arrival of the single currency in 1999, and what in effect became German interest rates all across the continent, the euro zone private sector went on a borrowing binge. Bank loans to the private sector soared by 3.5X during the period, growing at a 7.0% CAGR for twenty years running.

What has happened since the peak two years ago is self-evident. Europe ran out of credit-worthy borrowers——even at bank rates floating a few points above LIBOR at zero. In short, households and businesses in Europe are already in debt up to their eyeballs, or, at least, to the limits of their income carrying capacity.

Additional money printing at the ECB will therefore accomplish nothing more than what the fast money speculators and their compatriots in the halls of government intend. Namely, that the public debt will be fraudulently sequestered in the ECB’s vaults, while the gamblers collect handsome windfall gains on the securities they rented in the repo market.

Even as private sector spending and investment was capped by peak debt, and therefore constrained to levels supportable by current income and cash flow, the state sector was piling on additional baggage. Namely, as the euro zone countries have desperately tried to rein-in their soaring public debt, they have resorted to heavy tax increases, taking the tax burden to an all-time high of nearly 47% of GDP.

Eurozone Tax Share Of GDP (%)

And yet it is a virtual certainty that future tax rates will rise even more owing to the fact that the public debt ratio exploded upwards during the same period. Is it not surprising, therefore, that already debt-saturated households and business are not eager to take on even more debt. The ECB money printers are not only pushing on a string; they’re being completely thwarted by a rising fiscal burden that has crushed business enterprise and labor incentives across much of the continent.

Eurozone Public Debt As % Of GDP

Nor is the ECB the only money printing central bank pushing on a string. The Federal Reserve has been engaged in the same futile undertaking since the financial crisis of 2008. The fact is, there is no magic economic process by which central bank monetary policy is transmitted to the private sector. Its all about credit expansion, and the boost to spending that happens on a one-time basis while balance sheets are being levered-up.

But that’s over and done in the US, and most of the DM for that matter. In the case of US households, the only growth in debt has been for student loans and sub-prime auto borrowers. We already know where the latter will end-up—-with a surge of business for the repo man.

Moreover, the explosion of student loans to nearly $1.2 trillion was never really about lending in the first place; it was about lifetime debt servitude. Not surprisingly, on that portion of student debt that is actually in repayment status, the default rate is already north of 30% and rising rapidly.

The real story about household debt is conveyed in the chart below. “Peak debt” was reached in 2008 when total household credit outstanding reached nearly 220% of wage and salary income—or nearly 2.5X its historic and sustainable ratio prior to the 1980s. Since the financial crisis, debt ratios have been slowly falling, but still have a long way to go.

Consequently, the US household sector is now on its own. That is, its spending rate is now constrained by the tepid rate of income growth; the Keynesian parlor trick of credit inflation is over and done.

Likewise, the credit channel of monetary policy transmission is also no longer operative in the business sector. Too be sure, total business credit outstanding (corporate and non-corporate) has soared by nearly 30% from the pre-crisis peak, rising from $11 trillion in 2007 to $14 trillion at present.

But the overwhelming share of that surge has gone into financial engineering, not productive asset investment. And that is directly the result of the Fed’s 75 month long spree of ZIRP and massive balance sheet expansion. These ruinous policies have caused a veritable explosion of risk asset inflation, while at the same time herding investors into a desperate scramble for yield.

Not surprisingly, with the S&P 500 at 3X is post-crisis low, the return to the C-suite from stock buybacks, M&A and leveraged buyouts has dramatically outpaced gains from capital investment and R&D. These investments are being shunned for a logical reason. Namely, they must compete over the longer haul in a world that is universally saturated with excess capacity and malinvestments owing to the central bank financial repression and false pricing of capital markets over the last decade and one-half.

Indeed, even the modest level of CapEx posted in the US since the 2007 peak amounts to less than meets the eye. As shown in the chart below, the total increase in CapEx and R&D for the S&P 500 over the past six years was a modest $180 billion or less than 4% at an annual rate. But fully half of that gain—-$90 billion—- was accounted for by gains in the energy sector, and especially the shale patch.

Aside from the energy anomaly, which was driven by the $100/bbl. China bubble and an orgy of cheap junk debt issuance, the growth rate for investment spending in the rest of the economy has been a negligible 2.5% per annum. That’s right. After accounting for inflation, non-energy sector investment has been less than 1% annually.

Needless to remind, since 2007 the Fed’s balance sheet has exploded by 5X—from $900 billion to $4.5 trillion. And what does all that ZIRP and QE have to show for it? Well, a false boom in the shale batch owing to artificially expensive oil and inordinately cheap junk debt that is now fracturing violently; miniscule growth in non-energy business investment despite an eruption of ultra-cheap corporate debt; and a household sector that remains pinned down by peak debt.

Now that’s pushing on a string!

Its also the opposite of the Keynesian promise of “escape velocity” and “decoupling” in the USA. Take the fudge out of the phony Q3 GDP gain of 5%, and set aside the one-time run-up of sub-prime driven auto sales, and this is what you have.

Real GDP ex-autos expanded at a 2.3% rate during the four quarters ending in Q3 2014. That’s the same rate as for the year ending in Q3 2013, and actually below the 2.4% rate recorded for the four quarters ended in Q3 2012.

There has been no growth acceleration or escape velocity. The US economy is inching forward on its own capitalist hind legs. The Fed’s massive pushing on a string is only generating another giant financial bubble, as was evident in today’s rip by the day traders and robo machines.

Yet when the Fed’s bubble bursts again for the third time this century, the main street economy will be sent sprawling once more. Indeed, pushing on a monetary string is not only futile; it’s also ruinous in its ultimate effect.

Yes, what we are now hearing is the screeching of monkeys rattling their cages. And their awful clatter is not likely to abate any time soon.

372607,"Some critics of Edward Snowden criticize his chosen escape route from the United States. This criticism initially showed up as moralistic shock and outrage over the fact that Snowden had chosen to flee to China. “Why, China is an oppressive regime!” the critics cried.

Like most states, including the United States, China is in fact authoritarian, and not exactly a libertarian utopia. For Snowden, however (and it’s hard to blame him for this), it was better to be in China, than to be tortured in a military prison somewhere like Bradley Manning. Snowden has now apparently left China and is in Russia.

In neither Russia or China, has the local regime shown much interest in delivering Snowden to Snowden’s pursuers. Snowden, so far, it appears, has been rather savvy in his strategy to elude the American police state.

For the average regime apologist, for whom the U.S. government is the embodiment of all things just and moral, it is for some reason outrageous that Snowden has been playing one regime against another to protect his own interests. He knows that the Russian and Chinese governments have little interest in helping the American regime, and he also knows that in those two countries at least, the local regime was less likely to be bullied by the Americans into turning him over. We live in a multipolar world now, and not the world of the “American Superpower” that nostalgic neocons still pine for.

In response, the claims of the nationalists in the media and government has been to claim that Snowden is somehow a traitor or in league with the U.S’s “enemies.” We’re told he’s a Chinese spy. Now that he’s in Russia, I guess we’re supposed to assume he is a Russian spy. The fact that these foreign regimes which Snowden is using to his advantage do not adhere to libertarian notions of civil liberties, is supposed to therefore prove to us that Snowden must not actually care about liberty, and that’s he’s some sort of hypocrite. This claim doesn’t follow logically, of course, and it merely shows that Snowden likes to move to whatever place he feels is most likely to meet his particular needs.

People do this all the time, including libertarian-minded ones, who might move to a less free, more oppressive American State (i.e. New York) or unfree foreign country (i.e., The United Kingdom) in order to earn more money or be close to relatives. Few reasonable people would call someone a hypocrite because he accepted a job transfer to California, even if said person advocates for lower taxes or more gun ownership.

It is also true that Snowden is simply doing what states do all the time, which is to engage in realpolitik in pursuit of their own interests. Why is it immoral for Snowden to play the Russian regime against the American one, when it is moral for the American regime to pit the Syrian “rebels” (who eat the internal organs of their victims) against the Syrian regime? Over the years, the United States has allied itself with an endless list of mass murderers ranging from Stalin to Pol Pot to Pinochet and Saddam Hussein. But Snowden lived in China for a little while! What an horrible guy!

Unlike states, which use realpolitik to increase their own power and ability to kill, maim, and steal, Snowden has employed similar methods in the pursuit of being left alone and to simply tell Americans what the US Government does with our money.

224173,"Recently by Mac Slavo: American Powder Keg: Black Panther Chairman Declares ‘The Hour of War Is at Hand’

A couple of weeks ago our report that some Austrian banks had begun restricting the sale of gold and silver to 15,000 Euro (~$$20,000 USD) reportedly because of money laundering issues was met with disbelief by many readers of financial news and information web sites. As we mentioned in that commentary, it is our view that governments, namely in Western nations, are making it more difficult for individuals to make gold purchases, as well as to do so anonymously.

It looks like this trend of restricting the peoples ability to acquire assets of real monetary value is expanding. If a recent report from France is accurate, and based on the French governments official web site it looks like it is, then as of September 1, 2011, anyone attempting to sell or purchase ferrous or non-ferrous metals, which includes gold and silver, will be required to pay for their purchase via a credit card or bank wire transfer if it exceeds 450€ (~ $$600 USD):

Here is the applicable French law via www.legifrance.gouv.fr and translated into English by Google Translate:

Article L112-6 Amended by Law n ° 2011-900 of July 29, 2011  art. 51 (V)

I. Can be made in cash payment of a debt greater than an amount fixed by decree, taking into account the place of tax residence of the debtor and the professional purpose of the operation or not.

In addition a monthly fixed by decree, the payment of salaries and wages is subject to the prohibition contained in the preceding paragraph and shall be made by check or by transfer to a bank or postal account or account held by a payment institution.

Any transaction on the retail purchase of ferrous and non ferrous is made by crossed check, bank or postal transfer or by credit card, not the total amount of the transaction may not exceed a ceiling set by decree. Failure to comply with this requirement is punishable by a ticket for the fifth class.

II.-I Notwithstanding, the costs of the department conceded that exceed the sum of 450 euros must be paid by bank transfer.

III. The preceding provisions shall not apply:

a) For payments made by persons who are incapable of binding themselves by a check or other payment, as well as those who have no deposit account;

b) For payments made between individuals not acting for business purposes;

c) paying the expenses of the state and other public figures.

According to independent reports the law was passed to curb the illegal sale of stolen metals like copper, steel, etc. Given the rampant rise in thefts of these metals from telephone poles, construction sites and businesses here in the United States, we can certainly see this as a reasonable assessment for why the French passed this law.

However, the fact that no exception was made for gold and silver simply cannot be ignored. The new law effectively makes it illegal to purchase even a single Troy ounce of gold or around 18 ounces of silver in cash.

Looking at a single incident, for example the identification requirements in some major US cities like Houston, TX if you want to trade bullion, or the aforementioned restrictions in Austria, could be construed as coincidence or no big deal. But the most recent example in France suggests that what we have here is not a coincidence, but rather, a pattern. If there truly is a behind-the-scenes push to keep gold out of the hands of the people, then it would likely be done through indirect means and we commoners would be none the wiser.

How long before the US Congress, as a result of the rise in metals thefts here in the United States, uses this same excuse as a pretext to follow in the footsteps of the French?

Strike that question. That cant happen in America.

218188,"In 1961, I returned from the Soviet Union with a collection of propaganda posters. I used the posters to illustrate to students how government in a closed society can substitute propaganda for fact.

The most dramatic poster in my collection depicts a fascist who has climbed the upraised arm of the Statue of Liberty. A fiery torch in the fascist’s hand overlays the stone torch in Liberty’s hand, sending forth the flames of war. Bombs are falling on dark-skinned, white-robed Arab women and children.

This was Soviet propaganda’s portrait of the attempt in 1956 by Britain, France and Israel to reclaim from Egypt the Suez Canal, an effort that would have succeeded but for President Eisenhower’s intervention. The Soviet Union was not about to credit the United States for stopping the invasion.

Looking at the colorful poster, one is struck that a half century later events have turned propaganda into truth. American bombs have been falling on Arabs, killing thousands.

The entire world now knows that the reason Bush and Blair gave for invading Iraq was false. The invasion was a strategic blunder. It has created new enemies for America throughout the Muslim world, and perhaps beyond.

In The Pity of War, Niall Ferguson concludes his history of the First World War: “It was nothing less than the greatest error in modern history.” Is Bush’s invasion of Iraq the second greatest error in modern history? Has Bush set into motion the unification of hundreds of millions of Muslims under religious leaders?

Michael Polanyi wrote that World War I destroyed Europe. He did not mean merely the destruction of buildings and an entire generation. He meant the war destroyed European culture. After the senseless slaughter, the values rang hollow. Commitments lost their meaning. From the ashes rose Lenin, Stalin and Hitler. With them came alien doctrines that almost extinguished European civilization in the 20th century.

A newly released Heritage Foundation report on the dangers of a dirty bomb brings two questions to mind: (1) why have we so carelessly created enemies motivated to release radioactivity in our cities, and (2) will we see our culture destroyed as we become a police state in a vain attempt to forestall terrorist acts?

Recreating the ancient state of Israel after thousands of years was an audacious act requiring godlike diplomacy. But force took diplomacy’s place. As force has intensified, objections to Israel have mounted. The United States has foolishly spent $$200 billion creating new enemies for itself and Israel by invading Iraq. Imagine what this enormous sum could have achieved by ensuring the prosperity of an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. Peace is always cheaper than war.

As we are belatedly learning in Iraq, there are no easy military solutions to terrorism. If there were, Israelis would have achieved security many years ago. Terrorism requires that grievances be acknowledged and addressed. This requires humility. Jacobin arrogance merely stirs the pot. If we keep stirring the pot, we are going to become the least safe people on earth, living in fear not only of terrorists, but also of our own police state.

Bush and Blair diminish themselves daily with their continuing insistence on Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. It is as if they are reincarnations of Lord Curzon, British viceroy of India.

A century ago, Curzon convinced himself that Tibet was filled with Russians and Russian weapons, and had become a threat to British India. Curzon sent off an invasion force that managed to slaughter several hundred Tibetans but failed to find any Russians or weapons. By humiliating the hitherto impenetrable mysterious country, Curzon opened the door for the Chinese. In the same way, Bush’s invasion of Iraq has flung open the door for terrorism.

For me, that latter is the hardest. So take my advice with a grain of salt. In fact, I’d rather tell you all the ways in which I’ve messed up in negotiations. Because this is really the classroom I learned in.

A) IF YOU HAVE A SMALL LIST OF TERMS, YOU LOSE.

Let’s say you are selling a company. One side is usually focused on the final price. That side will henceforth be called “the loser”.

Make your list bigger: what are the terms of the non-compete, what is the length of the earn out, what are the salaries of the new top executives, what are the perks, what are the options packages.

Or if it’s a job: what are the responsibilities, what are similar people being paid, what is the path to higher promotions, what are the details of health, vacation, moving expenses, reviews, etc.

The side with the bigger list can give up the nickels for the dimes to the loser.

B) IF YOU DON’T GET ENOUGH SLEEP, YOUR WILLPOWER WILL BE ZERO.

Carl Icahn, one of the best investors in the world, uses this technique.

He schedules his negotiations for the early evening.

Our peak mental ability (according to Dan Ariely, author of Predictably Irrational, and many other books) is approximately 2 hours after we wake up until about 4 hours after we wake up.

And then throughout the day, our willpower slowly leaks away until we sleep again. That’s why we watch TV and eat donuts at night rather than when we first wake up.

So Carl Icahn will sleep until 4pm and then go to the negotiation at 6pm.

Choose Yourself! James Altucher Best Price: $$1.97 Buy New $$6.50 (as of 01:45 EST - Details )

BAM! Who do you think will win that negotiation.

C) MOST PEOPLE THINK SHORT-TERM. BE THE VISIONARY AND YOU WIN.

Applied Semantics didn’t want to sell to Google in 2001. They had raised some money and thought they could make it.

A few months earlier I had made the mistake of turning them down when they were raising money. “The search engine business is dead!” said the greatest prophet of modern times.

Me.

Larry Page told the CEO of Applied, “I’m not getting off the phone until you say yes”.

So Applied Semantics sold themselves in exchange for 1% of Google. ONE PERCENT.

This was before Google went public. So it was a total unknown what those shares would be worth. Larry Page had the vision of where they would be.

Applied Semantics became the Adsense division of Google. Which now accounts for 99% of Google’s revenues.

Are they upset? Shouldn’t they have sold for more?

Of course not. They sold for over a billion in value and created the end goal of making one of the best companies in the world.

You can only get rich once. Don’t worry so much about maximizing your percentage of something. One percent of $$250 billion is better than 100% of nothing, as the saying goes.

—

I’m going to take a break for a second and say something that has saved me considerable stress.

NEVER WORRY ABOUT WHAT IS IN SOMEONE ELSE’S POCKET.

Let other people do well. Then you will do well.

Ok, back to what you shouldn’t do in a negotiation.

—

D) DON’T SAY NO.

I say this even though I wrote the book, “The Power of No”. What I really mean here is, bury your NO inside of a YES.

I was negotiating with one company once. They wanted me to be an advisor. I said, “no”. But not like that. What I really said was, “You have a great company and I am happy to give advice.”

This made them want me as an advisor even more. Eventually they offered enough that I said, “yes”. They followed my advice exactly. The advice that I had already given for free.

There’s a well-known improv technique of “Yes, and…”

In improv, the first performer creates the premise. The second performer can’t change it or reject it, he can only build on it.

In a negotiation if someone says, “well, you’re only worth $$1 because you have X” you can say, “yes, and we also have Y so let’s take that into consideration.”

Suddenly your value is higher because you didn’t start a fight. You agreed and added.

E) MANY PEOPLE NEGOTIATE WITH THE WRONG MATH.

This is the part many people don’t get right and it’s hard to explain. I’ll take a simple example. I don’t know if the negotiation took place this way but it describes what I mean.

Why did Facebook buy Instagram for $$1 billion. Instagram had 11 employees and zero revenues.

On that basis, maybe Instagram was worth…nothing. Or close to it.

But maybe the negotiation went something like this:

Instagram: Let’s agree to a formula first on how we should value our company.

Facebook: Err…Ok.

Instagram: Forget about our revenues for a second. But let’s just assume we can earn $$X for every user you have (call that number $$Y). Pay us $$X * Y.

Facebook: Err.Ok.

Instagram probably then showed how they could add $$1 in value for every customer Facebook had. Facebook has a billion users. So a billion dollars.

Come to the negotiation with your formula. Know how to fill in the variables before the other side does. Every good negotiator does this.

The reason I know this? Because this is how I’ve lost many negotiations to good negotiators. I’ve had very good mentors on this one aspect of negotiation.

Because we all negotiated the formula, but not the price, in advance, then everyone has already said “Yes” to something and they basically have to stick with it.

(Well, they don’t have to. But it’s high stakes and you don’t want to seem like you don’t live up to your word.)

F) IF YOU HOPE FOR ONLY ONE OUTCOME, YOU NEVER GET IT.

I really wanted my company, Stockpickr, to be bought by Google. I threw everything I could into the basket. I would send them love notes in the middle of the night.

I didn’t have a technical team was the problem. We built the whole site for a few thousand dollars. I had one partner. We had 99% margins on our revenues but Google likes technical teams.

Oh well.

I then focused on getting alternatives. I called AOL, Yahoo, Reuters, Forbes. Then thestreet.com bought us.

Sometimes people write me and say, “I sent my ten ideas to my favorite company but they haven’t called back. Should I call them again?”

That’s the wrong question. The right question is: “What’s the next 100 companies I should write to?”

It’s no secret that being able to walk away from a negotiation is the best starting point in a negotiation.

G) SMARTER PEOPLE LOSE.

This is what I like to say: you guys are the experts at this, we’ve just been focused on building our product, company, art, whatever.

Then I say, “if you were me, what would you ask for?”

I ask them advice. Because they are the experts. It’s not a lie.

If you are applying for a job with someone more senior than you, why not ask the more senior guy for advice? He knows more than you.

Very often they give very good advice.

H) IF YOU NEGOTIATE WITH A LOSER, YOU LOSE.

If two sides are negotiating, you need at least one champion for what you are doing on the other side.

One time I was working with a company and GE offered us a billion dollars for the company. Yes, a BILLION.

They laid out the time frame. “The deal will be closed by November 15” said the highest ranking person in the room from GE.

I went back to the CEO of the company I was advising and told him that.

He said, “Who were you talking to?” I told him.

He said, “100% chance this deal doesn’t happen”.

But they offered! I told him. They actually made an offer.

“Trust me. No way. There’s no real champion for you on the other side who is close to being a decision maker. She is 5 rungs below the decision maker and she’s your only champion.”

You can only cross the bridge to the other side if someone strong is there holding out their hand to pull you in.

I) THE DEAL IS NOT THE FINAL DEAL. DON’T RELAX!

People think when they agree on a deal, that’s the end of the negotiation.

I’m sorry to say, that is only the beginning of the negotiation.

There’s agreeing, there’s signing, and there’s closing.

The final two steps are equally important and everyone assumes they are easy.

They aren’t. They are excruciatingly painful. The honeymoon period lasts for two days after you agree. Then there can be another six months to go.

Agreeing is easy. “I’ll buy your product or business for $$X.”

Signing a deal involves all the little things that are the nickels and dimes (see above).

Closing a deal means both sides delivering everything they represented in a deal.

At each stage of this is buyer’s remorse and seller’s remorse and often things have to be renegotiated.

So every day after agreement, make it a point to stay in touch, be friends, keep focusing on the vision (particularly with the champion for your deal on the other side), have just as much energy to close all the details, keep in touch with the lawyers to make sure paperwork is going through, keep working on the alternatives (since the negotiation is not done til it’s DONE), and so on.

So many deals fall apart after agreement. You don’t need this pain in your life.

—

LOVE IS A NEGOTIATION.

Taking another break here in the post. Please forgive me for not laying it out all perfect.

When I used to go on a first date I was both scared and excited. I’d get excited first, “she wants to date me!” And then I’d get scared. “Ugh, what do I do now?”

I’d literally do homework for the date. I’d find out her interests and read books on them. I’d watch comedy beforehand. I’d think of things to say and questions to ask. I’m not saying preparation is bad.

One time I was an expert on Kaballah. Another time I had to be an expert on Al Gore (long story). Another time I had to bribe the counter girl to pretend she knew me before my date arrived.

I’d be too scared to show my real self so I’d have to get her to like my fake self long enough for me to feel comfortable showing the real me.

This is the difference between agreeing on a deal (the first date) and closing (trust, love, real compassion). This is a problem I’m afraid I will always have. I hope I am getting better bit by bit.

—

J) MOST DEALS DON’T WORK OUT.

You agree, you sign, you close, and STILL it’s not the end.

Don’t be the guy (or woman) who falls apart now that all the energy of the deal has been expended.

It’s a negotiation and a deal because NOW there is work to do. There is a common vision to be achieved. There is a fantasy that must be made into reality.

Be that person. Be the one who delivers. You have a new baby in your hands as the result of this negotiation.

Now the hard work begins. Raise that baby to be a good adult.

466775,"Did the Fossil Skull Found in Africa Deserve Worldwide Headlines? Yes, But For Different Reasons Than Those Widely Reported. This Skull Undermines the Popular Theory of Darwinian Evolution

by Bill Sardi

There is a lot of envious competition in the field of paleontology these days. There have been so many recent breakthrough fossil finds that it boggles the mind. Tim Friend, reporter for USA Today, called this the “discovery of yet another human ancestor.”

Teams of bone diggers have been pulling out old fossils from their collections and conjuring up how to gain notoriety. They have now dug up yet another incredulous fossil, a skull from Chad in central Africa, that is causing quite a stir in scientific circles. In fact, it has been designated a whole new pre-human species, Sahelanthropos tchadensis.

Did This Fossil Warrant The Headlines?

There is so much uncertainty and speculation that surrounds this fossil that it is difficult to draw any conclusions, yet the news headlines herald this discovery as “one of the most sensational fossil finds in living memory,” says Time Magazine. “This is one of the most important fossil discoveries in the past 100 years,” according to Daniel Lieberman, biological anthropologist from Harvard University.

Fossil Fills Time Gap, So They Say

What would cause researchers to come to this conclusion? According to researchers, it is remarkably old, about 6 to 7 million years, so they say, and that makes it fill a 5 million year gap in time that has remained empty till now. The oldest ape fossils are dated back 7 to 8 million years and the oldest hominids (mammals that walk upright on two feet) are about 2 million years.

“It most certainly dates from very near that crucial moment in prehistory when hominids began to tread an evolutionary path that diverged from that of chimps, our closest living relatives,” says Time Magazine. The fact the skull has ape and human characteristics makes it a missing link, an evolutionary mixed-breed. One researcher calls this fossil “the closest thing we have to a common ancestor.” Lead paleontologist Michel Brunet says: “Sahelanthropus is the oldest and most primitive known member of the hominid clade, close to the divergence of hominids and chimpanzees.”

There is a great deal of criticism aimed at Brunet and his colleagues for calling their fossil a new hominid species. The skull and brain are no bigger than a chimp’s. “Features like a short face with a massive brow ridge, a mouth and jaw that protrude less than in most apes, and relatively small canine teeth make it clear that this creature was not a chimpanzee,” says Time Magazine. In fact, “A lot more modern looking than anyone would have expected at so early an evolutionary stage,” says Time. Some researchers believe this new fossil has more modern features than Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis) which is dated between 3.6 and 2.9 million years.

Just A Female Gorilla?

But Sahelanthropus may in fact be nothing more than a chimp. “If the new skull is from a female rather than a male, the canines are ‘less striking’ and more in line with those of living and extinct apes,” says Carol Ward of the University of Missouri, Columbia. Citing a similar fossil skull that was discovered in the 1960s and mistakenly accepted for two decades as that of a hominid before everyone agreed it was that of a gorilla, Brigitte Senut of the Natural History Museum in Paris says the recently found skull from Chad is nothing more than that of a female gorilla. “I don’t think we can say it’s a human relative, or even whether it’s male or female,” says Chris Stringer of the Human Origins Group at the Natural History Museum in London.

No Conclusive Proof It Walked Upright

Furthermore, the researchers only have a skull with few other bones from its relatives. The research team has only found two lower-jaw fragments and three isolated teeth they believe are from the same species. So they don’t have much to work with to prove its sex and whether it walked upright. Ann Gibbons of Science Now says “This debate could be settled if Brunet finds skeletal bones that show that Sahelanthropus was bipedal — and hence a hominid.” Time Magazine hesitatingly says Sahelanthropos “may have walked upright.” Without proof of being bipedal, how does this fossil rate such headlines?

Specious Dating Methods Used

Science writers for the news media don’t explain the assumptions many of these discoveries are based upon. A glaring problem is that of dating ancient fossils. If you buy into the evolutionary uniformitarian dating scheme (the fossil record ranges from the most simple forms of life in the deepest earth layers to the most complex life in the youngest surface rock beds), then you will have no trouble accepting what these researchers have to say. For decades now paleontologists have continually used circular reasoning to date fossils, an error repeated with the Sahelanthropus find. According to Michel Brunet and colleagues who found the ape-like/human-like skull in the sands of Chad, this fossil is 6 to 7 million years of age. It was dated by comparing the age of 42 species of surrounding animal and plant fossils (elephants, crocodiles, lizards) that have been dated in other geographical locations in this same ancient time period. The researchers repeatedly use the rock layers to date the fossils and index fossils to date the rocks.

Paleontologists usually attempt to corroborate their fossil ages with radiometric dating, calculations of decay rates of radioactive materials such as argon and potassium, which they attempted in this case. But again, these estimates are based upon assumptions of constant rates of decay. The flaws of radiocarbon dating are rarely pointed out to the lay reader. Unfortunately, Sahelanthropos was found in desert sand, not in between layers of volcanic ash which can be used to perform radiometric dating. So the researchers relied upon radiometric dating of similar animals found in other locations. Imagine a prosecutor in a court of law, before a jury, presenting extraneous evidence that was found far away from the scene of a crime. The case would be thrown out of court. Science reporters are slow to criticize anthropologists knowing their livelihood depends upon blockbuster news stories like Sahelanthropos.

Evolutionary Tree Flawed

The more remarkable back-door admission that has been squeezed out of evolutionists with the discovery of Sahelanthropos is that the current ape-to-man evolutionary tree displayed in biology textbooks is grossly in error. Time Magazine says “It could entirely demolish the idea of a tree, but rather that of a bush…with many species fighting for survival.” “A hominid of this age should certainly not have the face of a hominid less than one-third of its geological age,” says Bernard Wood of George Washington University.

“We’ve got it all wrong. There is no way you can shoehorn this discovery into any scenario that exists today,” says Ian Tattersal, curator of anthropology American Museum Natural History, New York. But don’t bet on any of those drawings of evolutionary trees pictured in textbooks being withdrawn anytime soon. Biology books have passed on evolutionary myths for decades, including pictures of mistaken missing links like Piltdown man (a fraud), Nebraska man (fossil consisted only of a tooth), and the Neanderthals (now considered a fully modern human who fabricated clothing, musical instruments and star maps and even mourned their dead).

Says Chris Stringer of the Human Origins Group at the Natural History Museum in London: “This discovery makes us realize how limited a view we have of human evolution. Questions in the world of paleontology are always complex and because evidence is usually incomplete, and there is little agreement about what key features characterize a distinct human ancestor.” With statements like that, again one wonders why a picture of this fossil skull has been aired by every major news outlet on the planet.

Missing Link Finally Found?

While Sahelanthropos may be found to be a monkey, its combination ape and human characteristics pose it as a possible evolutionary intermediate, a fact that has Darwinian evolutionists salivating. “Even if it is a big monkey, it’s even more interesting as a missing link,” says Yves Coppens of the College of France. Yet the time frame in which a common ape-like ancestor evolved into Homo sapiens is being shortened. The current evolutionary scheme believes this occurred 5 to 7 million years ago. Sahelanthropos is dated close to that period. The oldest ape fossils from Asia are about 7 to 8 million years old.

Rapid Or Slow Evolution?

Evolutionary change, facilitated by genetic mutations, is supposed to take millions of years. Now evolutionists have to explain faster changes than the previously estimated rate of Darwinian evolution. Overlooking the fact that genetic mutations only give rise to negative traits and defects, neo-Darwinists speculate that “punctuated equilibrium” may have taken place, a rapid jump or genetic alteration that produces a new species spontaneously. Punctuated equilibrium has never been observed.

Similar To Modern Humans?

In its story on Sahelanthropos, National Geographic indicates humans share 98 percent of their DNA with chimpanzees, but a recently completed human genome map startlingly discovered a very small human genome pool, not enough genes to explain the wide differences in characteristics between humans and lower forms of life.

Not Many Bones

It has been said that the total number of fossil bones used to substantiate evolutionary theories can be placed in a small box. Now the entire evolutionary scheme is about to be re-drawn based upon one skull. It hardly seems like enough evidence to alter ideas of man’s origins.

Says Michel Brunet, the discoverer of Sahelanthropos, “It will never be possible to know precisely where or when the first hominid species originated.”

Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery and made her stand in the middle. They said to him, ""Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?"" They said this to test him, so that they could have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with his finger. But when they continued asking him, he straightened up and said to them, ""Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her."" Again he bent down and wrote on the ground. And in response, they went away one by one, beginning with the elders. So he was left alone with the woman before him. Then Jesus straightened up and said to her, ""Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"" She replied, ""No one, sir."" Then Jesus said, ""Neither do I condemn you. Go, (and) from now on do not sin anymore."" (John 8: 311)

As we approach the new year with conservatism again ascendant in the political sphere, this story of Jesus uncompromising libertarianism seems even more timely than stories of his birth, despite the approach of his celebrated birthday. Nowhere does Jesus admonish social conservatives more harshly.

There is an important distinction here. By social conservative, I do not mean anyone who disapproves of certain human behavior. The freedom to follow the dictates of ones conscience was the first inalienable right recognized by the founders of our nation. If one truly believes that homosexuality, adultery, or other non-conservative behavior violates the laws of God, it is that persons inalienable right to disapprove of it, even to voice his disapproval of it, regardless of the anguished cries of the political correctness lobby on the left.

However, no one has a right to use violence against those who engage in behavior that does not harm another person, regardless of whether or not that behavior violates the laws of God. Since all laws are enforced under the threat of violence (as this story also makes wonderfully clear), Jesus makes it clear in this passage that it is not for men to enforce the laws of God. With the exception of cases in which one human being has harmed another, the right to punish the behavior of others is reserved for God.

It is important to recognize that Jesus does not condone the sin that the anonymous woman has committed. When he has shamed away the mob who would have stoned her, Jesus commands her to sin no more. Neither does he insinuate that her behavior might not have consequences for her soul. With flawless libertarian reasoning, Jesus teaches us the true meaning of freedom: that God grants us the liberty to do as we wish, even to reject him and his laws, but that we also bear the full consequences of our actions. If we harm another person, then we are subject to the laws of men. However, it is for each individual to determine the will of God according to his conscience and to choose whether to act accordingly or not. There never has been nor can there ever be any body of corruptible men who can save an individuals soul.

This is by no means the only place in the gospels that Jesus teaches us this lesson. His entire public ministry was one admonishment of the hypocritical, socially conservative theocracy after another. Indeed, it is the Jewish state that is Jesus chief antagonist throughout the gospels. He is noticeably disinterested in the more secular Roman government, despite its tyranny over his people. While he certainly doesnt approve of the Romans, he has no interest in political revolution. As Jesus tells Pilate, my kingdom is not of this world. (John 18:36). However, his own government does not merely commit secular, political oppression against its people. It usurps the authority of God and attempts to judge in his place. For this, Jesus constantly lets loose his most venomous admonishments.

The chief priests and Pharisees are constantly shown up for what they are throughout the gospels. They do not seek to punish sins to defend the honor of God, but for their own selfish political motives. Their persecution and eventual murder of Jesus himself is quite obviously perpetrated out of fear of his influence over the people. And what is this subversive influence that warrants torture and death? Love one another as I have loved you. Love your enemies. Do unto others as you have them do unto you. Of course the state would hate such a message. It runs afoul of every depravity that the state tries to exhort its citizens to, including its wars, its persecution of non-conformists, and its rampant looting of the citizenry dressed up as public works.

When Jesus encounters man-made laws masquerading as the laws of God, he openly condones breaking those laws. When his disciples pick fruit on the Sabbath and are caught in the act by the Pharisees, Jesus beats them at their own game by citing Jewish scripture, which describes David actually eating sacred bread out of the temple, reserved for the priests by Jewish law.

Demonstrating how perverse any theocratic state eventually becomes, the Pharisees then bring a man forward with a withered hand, daring Jesus to cure him and break the law himself. They are willing to see this man miss his one chance to be cured in the hopes that they can use their distorted interpretation of Gods command to keep holy the Sabbath to ensnare Jesus for political ends. Jesus breaks the law without hesitation, saying that it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath. Caring little for the wisdom of the lesson and interested only in maintaining their own autocratic power, the Pharisees withdraw to begin planning Jesus murder. (Matthew 12: 114)

By attempting to use the law to enforce their morality, social conservatives violate the very principles that they say that they cherish most. Social conservatives decry Islam because it attempts to propagate the faith by the sword. However, there is only a cosmetic difference between promoting your religious views through acts of terrorism and doing likewise through passing unjust laws against minorities who have no recourse but to obey or suffer violence. In both cases, it is the sword that compels the victim rather than the mind or the heart. Neither can social conservatives rely on the argument that their laws are passed by an elected body representing the people. If that justifies socially conservative laws, then what is their objection to the welfare state?

No part of this argument should be misconstrued as an endorsement of political correctness or the lefts agenda to grant positive rights to their own special interest groups for political purposes. If we are truly a free country and we meant what we said in the first amendment to our Constitution, then every individual, whether the most fundamentalist Christian or the most libertine atheist, should have the right to speak freely, even if what they say offends another person. For many devout Christians, it is their sacred duty to try to persuade their fellow man to repent of his sins and embrace Jesus as his savior.

However, there is an ocean of difference between persuasion and coercion. The minute that we say, there ought to be a law, we are picking up the sword. If we do so in defense of the inalienable human rights of life, liberty, and property, we are within our rightful authority. If we do so to supplant the authority of God, we become the very type of people that Jesus spent his life fighting against. To truly be Christian, we must recognize the need for a wall of separation between church and state.

Jesus was very clear about his views on what would lead to salvation and what would not. Jesus condemned many behaviors, like adultery, that social conservatives likewise condemn. He also said that no one comes to the Father except through me. (John 14:6) However, he does not go on to say, Therefore, if your brother does not come to me willingly, then draw your sword and force him. Salvation must be chosen; God did not create a race of slaves.

As we celebrate the birth of this great libertarian, let us not forget the lesson of his life and death. Jesus was murdered by the theocratic state for exposing their hypocrisy and resisting their unjust, blasphemous laws. Let us follow his example of speaking our minds according to our consciences but never raising our hand to save our brothers souls. Each one of us will ultimately find that our understanding of the will of God is imperfect, as we are imperfect. Therefore, we must follow Jesus example of tolerance and forgiveness, lest we find that we ourselves have mistakenly punished the innocent. Our laws should keep us from harming each other, and leave each persons soul to the judgment of God.

223384,"Recently by William Norman Grigg: ‘Mission No. 77’: U.S. — Funded False Flag Terrorism in Egypt

""There are things in the Constitution that have been overtaken by events, by time,"" insisted the late Rep. Henry Hyde in 2002, as the regime of Bush the Lesser prepared to invade and occupy Iraq. ""Declaration of war is one of them. There are things no longer relevant to modern society. Why declare war if you don't have to? We are saying to the president, ‘Use your judgment.’"" Having Congress declare war, Hyde concluded, would be ""inappropriate, anachronistic — it isn't done anymore.”

Were Hyde still alive, it would be interesting to ask him this question: Is it more appropriate and up-to-date for the United States to be committed to a war completely unrelated to our national interest by a synod of foreign diplomats meeting in a room on the banks of the East River in New York? That is what happened today when the UN Security Council, acting in a role equivalent to the Mafia “Commission” granting permission for an inter-mob hit, voted to “authorize” war in Libya. This was done in a fashion entirely uncontaminated by the congressional interference that militarist conservatives like Hyde found so disagreeable.

Like most modern conservatives, Hyde’s conspicuous reverence for the U.S. Constitution did not extend to the document’s unambiguous provision that Congress alone has the power to commit the U.S. Government to war by way of a formal, explicit declaration. Conservatives of his type are stridently committed to strict construction of the Constitution regarding every function of the federal government, save only the costliest and most destructive one.

Regarding the war-making power — which Madison described as the greatest of all “enemies of public freedom” — conservatives sound a great deal like FDR, who dismissed constitutional limitations on federal power as the archaic residue of “horse-and-buggy thinking.”

Warfare “encompasses and develops the germ” of every variety of domestic tyranny, Madison warned. It breeds “armies, and debts, and taxes,” which are “the known instruments for bringing the many under the dominion of the few”; this is why “no nation can preserve its freedom in the midst of continued warfare.” Madison’s indictment, while sound, neglects one aspect of perpetual war’s full-spectrum malignity: Continual warfare is, at best, a program for the incremental destruction of a nation’s independence.

The impending war with Libya is now added to the list of undeclared wars being conducted by the Regime in Washington. The Obama administration, emulating the diplomacy of the first Bush administration, circumvented Congress entirely, building an international “coalition” for a UN declaration of war. It did so in stupendously cynical fashion.

Several days ago, the Arab League, by unrecorded voice vote, petitioned the UN to enact a “no-fly zone” over Libya. The League’s resolution was brought about, in large measure, through a covert deal between Washington and Riyadh allowing the Saudis to dispatch an expeditionary force to Bahrain to help the Sunni al-Khalifa monarchy put down an uprising on the part of its suppressed and persecuted Shiite minority.

372275,"Sanity still exists, it’s just not consistently applied.

For instance, consider marriage. It is generally agreed that it ought to be voluntary – that both parties should be mutually consenting. And not just to the initial union, either – but to the union on an ongoing basis. If at any point the union is no longer satisfactory, the couple’s right to part from one another is rarely questioned. This is sane. The idea that they should be forced at gunpoint to stay together is (rightly) regarded by most people as insane.

Yet the same principle is rarely translated over to the realm of politics. We are told as children by our teachers about the “consent of the governed.” But when that consent is withdrawn, why is it that most people recoil from the idea of peaceful separation? Why do most people celebrate the forcible “union” of unwilling partners? How is it different to be told you must accept being lorded over by a certain form of government – or else – vs. being told you must stay with your husband or wife – or else? Is it a function of numbers? That is, because more than just two people are involved, it becomes ok to force some to be bound by others? Is it because of “process”? What makes that any different from a husband declaring he has a piece of paper in his hand that entitles him to “perpetual union” with his unwilling wife? Society, after all, is just intellectual shorthand for all the people in a given area. “Society” does not consent to anything because society does not exist. Only individual people exist – and do – or do not consent.

This right to consent – or not – necessarily implies the right to go our separate ways in peace, if the arrangements are not to the liking of each party to the “contract.” Each of us has an absolute right to demand our free consent before we are bound by anything. And to be unbound when the arrangement is no longer mutually satisfactory. It is a simple, logical argument – based on the same premise as a married couple choosing to part from one another. Yet most people – who agree that an unhappy married couple has a right (each of them) to pursue their own happiness, to leave the “union” if that is their choice – deny that same choice to themselves and everyone else when it comes to consenting to being governed. It is like insisting that before a woman may divorce her husband she must seek and obtain permission from her parents and his – perhaps also from the larger “community.” And that the “community” has a right to veto the woman’s free choice – and compel her to remain, by any means deemed necessary.

Is it not bizarre?

Americans pay homage to free choice – in theory – but increasingly deny it in everyday practice. This is so obvious it ought not to be necessary to mention examples, but: You are not free to hire whom you wish, to sell to whom you wish, to do as as you wish with your own property or your own physical body – even when none of these actions involves harm to the persons or property of others. It is enough that others don’t like whatever it is you’re wanting to do. This gives them the justification – as they see it – to take away your freedom to choose and in its place, compel you to accept the tyranny of others choosing for you. The circle of real free choice grows smaller almost daily in the “land of the free.” You may choose “venti” or “tall” at Starbucks. A Chevy rather than a Ford. But you may not choose to sell people coffee – or cars. Not without permission – and only under certain conditions. You’re not even free to travel without permission.

You have the freedom to do as you are told. To decide whether or not you will obey.

America is a strange land in which wrongs becomes right – ethically permissible – when groups commit them.

89929,"President Obama got his training with ACORN. Where the ACORN falls, so grows the tree.

ACORN has fallen.

ACORN got caught by a pair of creative actors, both conservatives. They went to ACORN posing as a pimp and his woman. How could they get government aid? ACORN had suggestions. They videotaped the exchange. Then they took a modified video — yes, faked — to Andrew Breitbart, the Web site master. The fake was this: in the video, the young man appears in a pimp’s outfit. In fact, he did not wear it in the room. This is being made into a big deal by the liberal media. ""Why, it’s all a fake!"" Look, the whole stunt was fake. What was not fake was the response from ACORN’s employees: the offer to help them get the money and break the law.

Breitbart tried to get the networks to run the video. He was turned down. So, he took it to Mr. Video Clip, Glenn Beck. Beck ran it. That was how ACORN got on the Web. The story is here.

The publicity has ruined ACORN. It lost a fortune in contracts from the Federal government. It is close to bankruptcy, laments this Leftist site.

It has local chapters. Its agenda will survive. But the tree got knocked down.

THE GREAT IRONY

I am of course both amused and delighted. Mostly amused. This was the perfect response to ACORN. That is because ACORN had long employed the tactics of a master organizer, Saul Alinsky. He wrote a book on his tactics, Rules for Radicals. It was published in 1971, the year before he died.

Alinsky was a radical, not a revolutionary. His strategy was to study an organization carefully. Understand how it works, he said. Then identify a weakness that is inherent in its rules or practices. He was amazingly successful at challenging organizations and forcing them to change their policies.

The two actors may not have understood that they were using a tactic devised by Alinsky. They spotted a weakness in ACORN’s practices: its commitment to getting government money for small businesses. They staged a charade. ACORN’s employees fell for it. It did not seem remarkable to them that a white teenage hooker and her white pimp wanted money from the government to set up a prostitution house for teenage girls who were in the clutches of a ""bad"" pimp. Government-subsidized entrepreneurship was right up ACORN’s alley. That was the end of ACORN. The charade was legal. There is no law against impersonating a hooker and her pimp.

Let me describe a classic Alinsky tactic. I wrote about it in 1983. A Christian college’s administration had allowed the students to invite Alinsky to speak. This was stupid. They soon learned just how stupid it was. Students came up to him after the lecture. They complained that nothing was allowed on campus. ""What is allowed?"" he asked. ""We can chew gum."" ""That’s it,"" he said. He told them to buy lots of gum. ""Keep chewing it. Spit it out the school sidewalks. Keep doing it, day after day. Tell the administration you will quit when it relaxes the other rules."" It took one week. You can read my column on Alinsky here.

ACORN got gummed by a pair of actors.

Now it is Obama’s turn to get gummed.

OBAMACARE AND THE HEALING STATE

National health care is the second most important of all government welfare programs. The first is funding education and making it compulsory. But this is generally enforced at the state level in the United States.

Why is government-funded medical care so important? Because it is the symbol of a state that has the power to extend life. It is the supreme agency of healing. Any government that does not pass laws funding and controlling the health care delivery system is seen by the apologists of state power as being inconsistent. A state that cannot heal is not a true god. The modern humanist state presents itself as the final court of appeal. It supposedly possesses final sovereignty.

Four centuries ago, this was called the divine right of kings. That meant that the king was the final court of appeal. There was no one or nothing higher, other than God. Today, the government’s position is that there is no God. Therefore, the state is the final sovereign. It is God by default.

A final sovereign must possess the power of life and death. So, we live under the jurisdiction of a welfare-warfare state.

The United States has had Medicare ever since 1965. The state has proclaimed itself as a healer of the old. This expense will bankrupt the Federal government unless the law is modified to allow cost-cutting. Politically, this is not yet possible. The oldsters want the money: over to $11,000 a year in subsidies.

This was not enough, according to Democrats. Another 30 million Americans need health insurance coverage. Now they are going to get it. Voters are going to pay.

Why isn’t this good politics? Because the Federal government waited too long. It is now running annual deficits over $1.5 trillion. This does not count the extra two trillion or so that accrue to the unfunded Medicare program each year. That is part of the off-budget budget.

At some point, all those oldsters who are dependent on the off-budget budget will be placed on the off-life support system. They will have their life support unplugged, at least figuratively and in some cases literally.

The motivation to get those 30 million people inside the health insurance system is a deeply religious motivation. The Democrats were upset that the United States government was not doing enough. What kind of healer is that?

The total expenditure for health care in the United States is about 15% of gross domestic product — higher than any other nation. This was not enough. There had to be more, the Democrats said. So, there will be. Costs will rise. Politicians are now on the hook. Who will pay these costs? It’s a government program now. There is no escape for the politicians. They must make some voting bloc angry. But which? What a dilemma!

The anger is enormous. It will increase. As of March 20, 59% of voters were opposed.

They see themselves as being ignored, which is in fact the case. This has created an opportunity for Republicans. They voted no unanimously.

This is pure politics. How often does a party vote 100% opposed? Almost never. They smell blood, and they reacted as sharks do. They voted for Bush’s bankrupting prescription drug subsidy program. Now they are all opposed. It’s politics.

Fifty years ago, I was talking with my liberal Democrat friend Joel Blain. Both of us knew how the subsidy ratchet works. It just keeps going up. So, he said to me, knowing full well I understood the game, ""Just let us pass a health care bill. We’ll try it for a couple of years. If it doesn’t work, you can repeal it."" That was Eisenhower’s last year in office. There was no way that the Federal government would pass a socialized medicine program. We both knew that. But if it ever did, it would be forever. It would create voting constituents.

Half a century later, the Democrats have gotten their way. The leadership recognizes that it will not be repealed. The leadership is serious about this law. These people know that the fall elections will result in Democrat losses. Harry Reid is way behind in Nevada. Yet they voted for the bill. They understand the religious implications of such sacrifice. They did it for the cause. The Federal government has extended its authority as a healer. With this authority will come lots of additional power.

They have sent a message to voters: ""We have sacrificed the principle of majority rule for the sake of a higher cause."" In principle, this is correct. If the voters want something evil, politicians should not vote for it. In early America, this was understood. Democracy meant the right of a majority to vote out of office anyone who opposed its will. It did not mean that a politician had a moral obligation to do what the majority wanted done every time. He was allowed to commit political suicide.

The Democrats face this problem: this view of democracy has not been widely preached or believed since 1913: the direct election of Senators. The push toward mass democracy has been constant. The older view has been abandoned. But now the Democrats have reverted to the older view. They will pay for this next November.

POLITICAL REVENGE

There is nothing morally wrong with the politics of revenge. Getting back at a politician for voting the wrong way was basic to early American politics. The Jeffersonians in 1800 got back at John Adams and the Federalists for the Alien and Sedition Acts. That ended Federalism as a national force. No one mourns their passing today. Few did in1801.

This time, there is enormous anger among hard-core Republicans and independents. They will not forget. Usually, voters do forget, but not this time. The law back-loads the financing. The burden will hit in full force in 2014. This is standard politics, but this time, it will backfire. Why? Because of the size of the Federal deficit.

The welfare states of Western Europe swallowed the pill of socialized medicine after World War II. The voters have gotten used to the cost. It is part of the social background. To single out medical costs as uniquely bankrupting is unthinkable, even though true.

Here, it is different. The law will go into effect at a time when the deficit has become unthinkably high. It finally is getting through to voters that it threatens their lifestyles in the future. They are beginning to get afraid. They should be afraid.

The Democrats waited too long. The deficits are now Obama’s. They must be dealt with on his watch. He refuses to deal with them. In this setting, the Democrats rammed through the bill.

The voters will be reminded, year by year, that this was done against their will. The Democrats will not be able to blame Bush. The burden will aggravate people, because they did not want the program.

Democrats assume that voters will forget. Voters at the margin will not forget. They will be reminded.

To get blamed, the Republicans must have the White House, the House, and 60 votes in the Senate. Until this happens, they can play the role of helpless babes in the woods. That means the Democrats will get blamed. This issue will not go away, because costs will rise.

The tea party movement is at present amateurish. Time will take care of that. If Republicans do not deal with it, they will lose elections. The revolt against waffling is real. These people are dangerous to Republicans who waffle on spending. They will not be able to be elected.

Usually, negative voting blocs get marginalized. The beneficiaries of boondoggles are concentrated. They want the subsidy. The opponents are not well organized. The costs of the boondoggle are shared by too many taxpayers. Resistance is minimal compared to the promotion.

This time it will be different. The politics of vengeance is now in play. The voters will be reminded, year after year, that the program was shoved down their throats.

CONCLUSION

Alinsky always searched for the weak spot in the opposition’s system. Then he exploited it.

Obama now has a weak point: ObamaCare. This time, the taxpayers and insurance premium payers and patients sitting endlessly in filled doctors’ offices will be reminded about who did it to them. It was Obama and the banshee with the huge Medicare gavel, Nancy Pelosi. They pride themselves on having thwarted the voters. They believe they will get away with it. They think voters will forget. But medical care costs are close to people’s hearts. They will pay attention to their bills, including their tax bills.

The tea party types will make it hot for Republicans who think they can keep spending. The climate of opinion has changed. The deficit has changed it.

The costs of this program will not be ignored. This is not Europe. This is a new program. It was passed by a defiant majority in Congress. That majority will be depleted.

The very phrase, ""ObamaCare,"" will become a liability. It ought to be called PelosiCare, but it isn’t. Obama has defined his administration by this one law. He got it passed. He owns it.

The tea parties have only just begun. The Democrats are not afraid yet. What will make a difference will be Republicans who lose because they refuse to give the tea party voters what they want.

The Christian Right got bought off easily in Reagan’s first year. All they demanded was rhetoric. Reagan was good at this. So, they were eased out by the Bush faction, which ran the White House under Reagan. They were in the Bush family’s hip pocked, so the Bushes sat on them.

The tea party will not get bought off so easily. Their anger is too great.

55056,"This essay is adapted from Jeffrey’s new book, Sing Like a Catholic.

The people who make modern inventions are often celebrated for improving our lives. But what about those one thousand years ago who laid the very technological foundation of civilization as we know it? They too served the world, but with the primary purpose of contributing to the faith. I’m thinking here of those who solved the architectural problem to build the great cathedrals of the middle ages, and the scientists of the period who took the first steps toward modern medical knowledge.

Also we don’t often consider the innovations in art that make all music possible. There is one person who stands out here: the late 10th and early 11th century Benedictine monk named Guido d’Arezzo (991/992—after 1033). He is credited with fantastic musical innovations that led to the creation of the modern system of notes and staffs, and also the organization of scales that allowed for teaching and writing music.

His contributions have usually been seen as technical innovations and evaluated as such, though known only inside a small circle of music historians. Without his contribution, the music you hear on your iPod and on the radio would not likely exist.

A new book by Angelo Rusconi, synopsized by Patrick Reynolds from the Italian, and appearing in Goldberg #46 (2007), offers a more complete picture of what drove Guido, and the results will be very exciting for anyone who seeks to understand how any serious innovation upsets the status quo, makes enemies, causes a bit of social upheaval, and ultimately makes the world a better place.

Consider the technical feat that Guido undertook. Imagine a world without printed music. How would you go about conveying a tune in printed form? It’s one thing to render words on paper in a way that others can read them. But what about sound? It floats in the air and resists having a physical presence at all.

How can you share the melody without singing it for them, by just writing things down? People had tried since the ancient world without success. Some attempts in the 8th and 9th centuries came a bit closer (but the results look like chicken scratch to us). It was Guido who made the breakthrough with lines and scales that illustrate for the eye what the voice is to sing, and precisely so. His innovation was a beautiful integration of art and science.

And what a remarkable innovation, if you think about it. From the beginning of time until his time, the teaching of music was done by a tiny and ever-arrogant cartel of masters. You had to sing exactly as they instructed you. If they weren’t around, you were stuck. They held the monopoly. To become a master of music, you had to study under one of the greats, and then receive the blessing to become a teacher yourself, and you know that they wanted to limit their numbers. One can imagine that you had to be sycophantic to even get your foot in the door.

Guido’s innovation busted up the cartel. Rusconi shows that Guido’s primary interest was in notating not just music in general but Gregorian chant in particular. He was frustrated that the chant was passed on by oral tradition only. He worried that melodies would be lost, especially given the then new fashion for multi-part improvisation.

So while writers have usually treated Guido as an innovator, what’s been forgotten is that his innovations were driven by the desire to conserve and preserve for future generations. The desire to maintain the chant and pass it on was the key issue for him; the technical aspects of the music and writing were merely tools and not ends in themselves. And there was an interesting sociological element here. He had become seriously annoyed at the cartel of chant masters and the power they exercised over the monastic community. He wanted the chant to be freed and put into the hands of everyone both inside and outside the monastery walls.

For this reason, his first great project was a notated Antiphoner, a book of melodies: “For, in such a ways, with the help of God I have determined to notate this antiphoner, so that hereafter through it, any intelligent and diligent person can learn a chant, and after he has learned well part of it through a teacher, he recognizes the rest unhesitatingly by himself without a teacher.” He goes further. Without a written form of music “wretched singers and pupils of singers, even if they should sing every day for a hundred years, will never sing by themselves without a teacher one antiphon, not even a short one, wasting so much time in singing that they could have spent better learning thoroughly sacred and secularly writing.” The elite musicians resisted his attempt to democratize the knowledge and conserve time. Guido did whatever great innovator does: he freed up resources for other uses even while improving lives.

But as a result of his innovation, his monastery in Pomposa, Italy, tossed him out into the snow. He then went to the Pope, who was very impressed, and gave him a letter of support. With the letter in hand, he went to the Bishop of Arezzo, who took him in so that he could continue his preaching and his work. Now, one can’t but think of mistakes that have been made over the years with the Gregorian chant: the attempt to keep it the private preserve of musicologists; the dominance of singers by a single master who believes that he knows the one true way; the perception that chant is only for monasteries but not regular people; and on and on.

Here we see Guido embodying the same principle that drove the Solesmes monastery at the early part of the restoration efforts in the late 19th century: innovation in order to preserve, teach, and distribute this glorious music as widely as possible, in the service of the faith. They had the right ordering of priorities: technical innovation in the service of preserving universal truth.

This story illustrates a general principle in the history of technology. There does seem to be a real pattern here. There are those who believe that innovation is for everyone and ought to be accessible to all — that everyone should be permitted to have access to the forms and structures that make for progress. This side loves technical innovation not for its own sake but in the service of great goals. Then there is the other side, which is reactionary, hates technical innovation, wants to reserve technical forms to a tiny elite, fears freedom, detests the idea of human choice, and advances a kind of Gnosticism over technical forms — always wants it to remain the private preserve of the elect who appoint each other and operate as a kind of guild. This Gnostic guild wants to guard and exclude and privatize, and the people are ultimately their enemy.

This perspective hearkens back to the ancient world where priests served the philosopher kings, and sparingly hand out religious truth to the masses based on what they believe they should know in the service of their agenda.

One can detect these two tendencies from all ages.

In his pedagogy, he adapted an existing song to illustrate the scale: Ut Queant Laxis, a hymn to St. John the Baptist, who was then considered the patron saint of singers. On the first syllable of each ascending note, the words were Ut, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol — the very foundation of music pedagogy to this day: do, re, mi, etc.

A millennium later, Guido’s innovation is still with us!

Here is a model for our times and all times.

457320,"National Security Adviser Susan Rice recently wound up her stay in China to prepare the November visit of President Obama, President of The Indispensible Nation. She was greeted with due pomp by Xi Jinping, President of China, one of the Dispensible Nations.

I wrote about that visit earlier. A transcript of the interchange was not available at the time, but it has now been provided by anonymous sources, every bit as reliable as those of the NYT’s Chief Military Correspondent, the indispensible Michael R. Gordon. (For those not aware of Gordon’s reportorial prowess, he co-authored, with Judith Miller, the key article on Iraq’s WMD in 2002, which was praised greatly by Vice-President Richard Cheney on the very day it appeared and assigned page one status by the indispensible editors of the Times.)

This reporter noticed similarities in style and nuanced diplomatic language between Rice and Victoria Nuland, the Indispensible Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, which makes the authenticity of the transcript even more credible. The transcript is as follows:

Xi: It is a delight to have you here in Beijing, and all China looks forward to President Obama’s forthcoming visit. We hope to discuss the emerging possibility of win-win agreements with your country, which will be a great benefit to East Asia and the entire world.

Rice: Let us not waste your time or mine. Why don’t you get behind our sanctions on Russia and Iran – and Cuba and Venezuela while we are at it. We need to get them to change their behavior and eventually their governments. Defying the Indispensible Nation has consequences in the long term. You should make them keenly aware of that.

Xi: (Surprised). Ms. Rice, as you know, our policy is not to interfere in the internal matters of other nations. That has been our policy for centuries and it remains our policy now. And many of your European partners do not appear to be very enthusiastic about such a course either, especially in the Ukraine, if I may say so.

Rice: (Annoyed). To quote my Indispensible colleague, Victoria Nuland, protégé of our next President, the Indispensible Hillary Clinton, “F**k the EU“ – and Russia too while we are at it.

Xi: (Blushing). Russia is a close partner of ours as we seek to develop our countries and those of Central Asia. We plan a vast trading partnership, a new Silk Road. The United States can also benefit from this.

Rice: (Now Angry). Silk Road? You and I know that is just an attempt to build a Eurasian trade path that bypasses the Oceans, which are under control of the Indispensible Navy. I assure you it will not be a happy venture once Russia collapses.

Xi: (Startled). Russia collapse? Its economy has made great gains since the departure of Yeltsin, and its forms of democracy, largely European, seem to be suited to its culture which has made the country more stable.

Rice: (Furious now). Putin is another Hitler – as everyone who reads in rows not columns knows. We have decided that he and the portion of the Russian elite that does not kowtow to the Indispensible Nation must go. Period, Xi, baby.

Xi: (Remaining composed). We hope that you can look for a win-win situation with our friend Vladimir Putin. We were disturbed to see the emergence of neo-fascist forces in Ukraine, and Russia handled that violent situation in a largely peaceful way. Let us hope Ukraine can now have beneficial relations with both the EU and Russia.

Rice: (Even more infuriated). We’ll see about that. You better be a bit more concerned about Japan, where our friend Mr. Abe is on his way to creating an Asian order that will put China in its proper place.

Xi (Shocked). We are indeed concerned about the rise of militarism in Japan. The forces behind it are the very ones that brought the sufferings of World War II on China and the rest of East Asia. And they are all too similar to the ones that have emerged in Kiev. The world does not need that again. And there is no guarantee that such a development would not turn on the United States in the long run. That would serve no one well.

Rice: We shall see about that. You know I have not even mentioned human rights. You are lucky to get off the hook on that one.

Xi: Every country has its human rights problems. We hope to make more progress but already personal liberties are at an all time high her and improving. Well, I know that you have other preparations to make for the upcoming visit of your president. Please contact me if I can help. (Xi departs.)

73827,"Peace, Prosperity, and Liberty

by Rep. Ron Paul, MD

In the House of Representatives, September 5, 2002

Introduction

Mr. Speaker:

Thomas Jefferson spoke for the founders and all our early presidents when he stated: “peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none…” which is, “one of the essential principles of our government.” The question is: Whatever happened to this principle and should it be restored?

We find the 20th Century was wracked with war, peace was turned asunder, and our liberties were steadily eroded. Foreign alliances and meddling in the internal affairs of other nations became commonplace. On many occasions, involvement in military action occurred through UN resolutions or a presidential executive order, despite the fact that the war power was explicitly placed in the hands of Congress.

Since World War II, nearly 100,000 deaths and over a quarter million wounded (not counting the many thousands that have been affected by Agent Orange and the Persian Gulf War Syndrome) have all occurred without a declaration of war and without a clear-cut victory. The entire 20th century was indeed costly, with over 600,000 killed in battle and an additional million wounded.

If liberty had been truly enhanced during that time, less could be said about the imperfections of the policy. The evidence, however, is clear that we as a people are less free, and the prosperity we still enjoy may be more illusionary than many realize. The innocent victims who have suffered at the hands of our militarism abroad are rarely considered by our government. Yet they may well be a major factor in the hatred now being directed toward America. It is not currently popular to question corporate and banking influence over a foreign policy that replaced the wisdom of Washington and Jefferson. Questioning foreign government influence on our policies, although known about for years, is not acceptable in the politically correct environment in which we live.

There’s little doubt that our role in the world dramatically changed in the 20th century, inexorably evolving from that of strict non-interventionism to that of sole superpower, with the assumption that we were destined to be the world policeman. By the end of the 20th century, in fact, this occurred. We have totally forgotten that for well over a hundred years we followed the advice of the founders by meticulously avoiding overseas conflicts. Instead we now find ourselves in charge of an American hegemony spread to the four corners of the earth.

Now we have entered the 21st century, and there is not a country in the world that does not either depend on the U.S. for protection, or fear her wrath if they refuse to do her bidding. As the 20th century progressed, American taxpayers were required to finance, with great sacrifices to their pocketbooks and their liberty, the buying of loyalty through foreign aid and intimidation of those countries that did not cooperate.

The question remains, however: Has this change been beneficial to freedom and prosperity here at home, and has it promoted peace and trade throughout the world? Those who justify our interventionist policies abroad argue that the violation of the rule of law is not a problem, considering the benefits we receive for maintaining the American empire. But has this really taken into consideration the cost in lives lost, the damage to long-term prosperity, as well as the dollar cost and freedoms we have lost? And what about the future? Has this policy of foreign intervention set the stage for radically changing America — and the world — in ways not yet seen? Were the founders completely off track because they lived in different times, or was the foreign policy they advised based on an essential principle of lasting value? Choosing the wrong answer to this question could very well be deadly to the grand experiment in liberty begun in 1776.

The Slippery Road to World Policeman

The transition from non-interventionism to our current role as world arbiter in all conflicts was insidious and fortuitous. In the early part of the 20th century, the collapse of the British Empire left a vacuum, which was steadily filled by a US presence. In the latter part of the century, the results of World War II and the collapse of the Soviet system propelled us into our current role. Throughout most of the 20th century, it was our competition with the Soviets that prompted our ever-expanded presence around the world. We are where we are today almost by default. But does that justify interventionism or prove it is in our best interest?

Disregarding for the moment the moral and constitutional arguments against foreign intervention, a strong case can be made against it for other reasons. It is clear that one intervention begets another. The first problem is rarely solved, and new ones are created. Indeed, in foreign affairs a slippery slope exists. In recent years, we too often slipped into war through the back door, with the purpose rarely defined or understood and the need for victory ignored.

A restrained effort of intervention frequently explodes into something that we did not foresee. Policies end up doing the opposite of their intended purpose — with unintended consequences. The result is that the action taken turns out to actually be detrimental to our national security interests. Yet no effort is made to challenge the fundamental principle behind our foreign policy. It is this failure to adhere to a set of principles that has allowed us to slip into this role, and if unchallenged, could well undo the liberties we all cherish.

Throughout history, there has always been a great temptation for rulers to spread their influence and pursue empire over liberty. Few resist this temptation to power. There always seems to be a natural inclination to yield to this historic human passion. Could it be that progress and civilization and promoting freedom require ignoring this impulse to control others, as the founders of this great nation advised?

Historically, the driving force behind world domination is usually an effort to control wealth. The Europeans were searching for gold when they came to the Americas. Now it’s our turn to seek control over the black gold which drives much of what we do today in foreign affairs. Competing with the Soviet Union prompted our involvement in areas of the world where the struggle for the balance of power was the sole motivating force.

The foreign policy of the 20th century replaced the policy endorsed by all the early presidents. This permitted our steadily growing involvement overseas in an effort to control the world’s commercial interests, with a special emphasis on oil.

Our influence in the Middle East evolved out of concern for the newly created state of Israel in 1947, and our desire to secure control over the flow of oil in that region. Israel’s needs and Arab oil have influenced our foreign policy for more than a half a century.

In the 1950s, the CIA installed the Shah in Iran. It was not until the hostage crisis of the late 1970s that the unintended consequences of this became apparent. This generated Iranian hatred of America and led to the takeover by the reactionary Khoumini and the Islamic fundamentalists. It caused greater regional instability than we anticipated. Our meddling in the internal affairs of Iran was of no benefit to us and set the stage for our failed policy in dealing with Iraq.

We allied ourselves in the 1980s with Iraq in its war with Iran, and assisted Saddam Hussein in his rise to power. As recent reports reconfirm, we did nothing to stop Hussein’s development of chemical and biological weapons and at least indirectly assisted in their development. Now, as a consequence of that needless intervention, we’re planning a risky war to remove him from power. And as usual, the probable result of such an effort will be something our government does not anticipate — like a takeover by someone much worse. As bad as Hussein is, he’s an enemy of the Al Qaeda, and someone new may well be a close ally of the Islamic radicals.

Although our puppet dictatorship in Saudi Arabia has lasted for many decades, it’s becoming shakier every day. The Saudi people are not exactly friendly toward us, and our military presence on their holy soil is greatly resented. This contributes to the radical fundamentalist hatred directed toward us. Another unfavorable consequence to America, such as a regime change not to our liking, could soon occur in Saudi Arabia. It is not merely a coincidence that 15 of the 9/11 terrorists are Saudis.

The Persian Gulf War, fought without a declaration of war, is in reality still going on. It looks now like 9/11 may well have been a battle in that war, perpetrated by fanatical guerillas. It indicates how seriously flawed our foreign policy is. In the 1980s, we got involved in the Soviet/Afghan war and actually sided with the forces of Osama bin Laden, helping him gain power. This obviously was an alliance of no benefit to the United States, and it has now come back to haunt us. Our policy for years was to encourage Saudi Arabia to oppose communism by financing and promoting Islamic fundamentalism. Surely the shortcomings of that policy are now evident to everyone.

Clinton’s bombing of Sudan and Afghanistan on the eve of his indictment over Monica Lewinsky shattered a Taliban plan to expel Osama bin Laden from Afghanistan. Clinton’s bombing of Baghdad on the eve of his impeachment hardly won any converts to our cause or reassured Muslim people in the Middle East of a balanced American policy.

The continued bombing of Iraq over these past 12 years, along with the deadly sanctions resulting in hundreds of thousands of needless Iraqi civilian deaths, has not been beneficial to our security. And it has been used as one of the excuses for recruiting fanatics ready to sacrifice their lives in demonstrating their hatred toward us.

Essentially all Muslims see our policy in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as being openly favorable toward Israel and in opposition to the Palestinians. It is for this reason they hold us responsible for Palestinian deaths, since all the Israeli weapons are from the United States. Since the Palestinians don’t even have an army and must live in refugee camps, one should understand why the animosity builds, even if our pro-Israeli position can be explained.

There is no end in sight. Since 9/11, our involvement in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia has grown significantly. Though we can badger those countries — whose leaders depend upon us to keep them in power — to stay loyal to the United States, the common people of the region become more alienated. Our cozy relationship with the Russians may not be as long-lasting as our current administration hopes, considering the $40 billion trade deal recently made between Russia and Saddam Hussein. It’s more than a bit ironic that we find the Russians now promoting free trade as a solution to a difficult situation while we’re promoting war.

This continuous escalation of our involvement overseas has been widespread. We’ve been in Korea for more than 50 years. We have promised to never back away from the China-Taiwan conflict over territorial disputes. Fifty-seven years after World War II, we still find our military spread throughout Europe and Asia.

And now, the debate rages over whether our national security requires that we, for the first time, escalate this policy of intervention to include “anticipatory self-defense and preemptive war.” If our interventions of the 20th century led to needless deaths, unwinnable wars, and continuous unintended consequences, imagine what this new doctrine is about to unleash on the world.

Our policy has prompted us to announce that our CIA will assassinate Saddam Hussein whenever it gets the chance and that the government of Iraq is to be replaced. Evidence now has surfaced that the United Nations inspection teams in the 1990s definitely included American CIA agents who were collecting information on how to undermine the Iraqi government and continue with the routine bombing missions. Why should there be a question of why Saddam Hussein might not readily accept UN inspectors without some type of assurances? Does anybody doubt that control of Iraqi oil supplies, second only to Saudi Arabia, is the reason U.S. policy is belligerent toward Saddam Hussein? If our goal is honestly to remove dictators around the world, then this is the beginning of an endless task.

In the transition from the original American foreign policy of peace, trade, and neutrality to that of world policeman, we have sacrificed our sovereignty to world government organizations, such as the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO. To further confuse and undermine our position, we currently have embarked on a policy of unilateralism within these world organizations. This means we accept the principle of globalized government when it pleases us, but when it doesn’t, we ignore it for the sake of our own interests.

Acting in our own interest is to be applauded, but what we’re getting is not a good alternative to a one-world government. We don’t get our sovereignty back, yet we continue to subject ourselves to a great potential financial burden and loss of liberty as we shift from a national government, with constitutional protection of our rights, to an international government, where our citizens’ rights are threatened by treaties we haven’t ratified, like the Kyoto and International Criminal Court treaties. We cannot depend on controlling the world government at some later date, even if we seem to be able to do that now.

The unilateralists’ approach of dominating world leaders and arbitrarily ignoring certain mandates — something we can do with impunity because of our intimidating power — serves only to further undermine our prestige and acceptability throughout the world. And this includes the Muslim countries as well as our European friends. This merely sets the stage for both our enemies and current friends to act in concert against our interests when the time comes. This is especially true if we become financially strapped and our dollar is sharply weakened and we are in a much more vulnerable bargaining position.

Unilateralism within a globalist approach to government is the worst of all choices. It ignores national sovereignty, dignifies one-world government, and places us in the position of demanding dictatorial powers over the world community. Demanding the right to set all policy and exclude ourselves from jurisdictional restraints sows the seeds of future discontent and hostility.

The downside is we get all the bills, risk the lives of our people without cause, and make ourselves the target for every event that goes badly. We get blamed for the unintended, unforeseen consequences and become the target of terrorists that evolve from the radicalized fringes.

Long-term, foreign interventionism does not serve our interests. Tinkering on the edges of our current policy will not help. An announced policy of support for globalist government, assuming the financial and military role of world policeman, maintaining an American world empire, while flaunting unilateralism, is a recipe for disaster. US unilateralism is a far cry from the non-intervention that the founders advised.

The Principle Behind Foreign Policy

The term “foreign policy” does not exist in the Constitution. All members of the federal government have sworn to uphold the Constitution, and should do only those things that are clearly authorized. Careful reading of the Constitution reveals Congress has a lot more responsibility than the President in dealing with foreign affairs. The President is the Commander-in-Chief, but can’t declare war or finance military action without explicit congressional approval. A good starting point would be for Congress to assume the responsibility given it and to make sure the executive branch does not usurp any authority explicitly granted to Congress.

A proper foreign policy of non-intervention is built on friendship with other nations, free trade, and open travel, maximizing the exchanges of goods and services and ideas. Nations that trade with each other are definitely less likely to fight against each other. Unnecessary bellicosity and jingoism is detrimental to peace and prosperity, and incites unnecessary confrontation. And yet, today, that’s about all we hear coming from the politicians and the media pundits who are so anxious for this war against Iraq.

We should avoid entangling alliances and stop meddling in the internal affairs of other nations — no matter how many special interests demand otherwise. The entangling alliances that we should avoid include the complex alliances in the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO. One-world government goals are anathema to non-intervention and free trade. The temptation to settle disputes and install better governments abroad is fraught with great danger and many uncertainties.

Protecting our national sovereignty and guaranteeing constitutional protection of our citizens’ rights are crucial. Respecting the sovereignty of other nations, even when we’re in disagreement with some of their policies, is also necessary. Changing others then becomes a job of persuasion and example — not force and intimidation — just as it is in trying to improve personal moral behavior of our fellow citizens here at home.

Defending our country from outside attack is legitimate and is of the highest priority. Protecting individual liberty should be our goal. This does not mean, however, that our troops should follow our citizens or their investments throughout the world. While foreign visitors should be welcomed, no tax-supported services should be provided. Citizenship should be given with caution, and not automatically by merely stepping over a national boundary for the purpose of giving birth.

A successful and prosperous society comes from such policies and is impossible without a sound free-market economy, one not controlled by a central bank. Avoiding trade wars, devaluations, inflations, deflations, and disruption of free trade with protectionist legislation is impossible under a system of international trade dependent on fluctuating fiat currencies controlled by world central banks and influenced by powerful financial interests. Instability in trade is one of the prime causes of creating conditions that lead to war.

The basic moral principle underpinning a non-interventionist foreign policy is that of rejecting the initiation of force against others. It is based on non-violence and friendship unless attacked, self-determination, and self-defense while avoiding confrontation, even when we disagree with the way other countries run their affairs. It simply means that we should mind our own business and not be influenced by special interests that have an ax to grind or benefits to gain by controlling our foreign policy. Manipulating our country into conflicts that are none of our business and unrelated to national security provides no benefits to us, while exposing us to great risks financially and militarily.

What Would a Foreign Policy For Peace Look Like?

Our troops would be brought home, systematically but soon. Being in Europe and Japan for over 50 years is long enough. The failure in Vietnam resulted in no occupation and a more westernized country now doing business with the United States. There’s no evidence that the military approach in Vietnam was superior to that of trade and friendship. The lack of trade and the imposition of sanctions have not served us well in Cuba or in the Middle East. The mission for our Coast Guard would change if our foreign policy became non-interventionist. They, too, would come home, protect our coast, and stop being the enforcers of bureaucratic laws that either should not exist or should be a state function.

All foreign aid would be discontinued. Most evidence shows that this money rarely helps the poor, but instead solidifies power in the hands of dictators. There’s no moral argument that can justify taxing poor people in this country to help rich people in poor countries. Much of the foreign aid, when spent, is channeled back to weapons manufacturers and other special interests in the United States who are the strong promoters of these foreign-aid expenditures. Yet it’s all done in the name of humanitarian causes.

A foreign policy of freedom and peace would prompt us to give ample notice before permanently withdrawing from international organizations that have entangled us for over a half a century. US membership in world government was hardly what the founders envisioned when writing the Constitution. The principle of Marque and Reprisal would be revived and specific problems such as terrorist threats would be dealt with on a contract basis incorporating private resources to more accurately target our enemies and reduce the chances of needless and endless war. This would help prevent a continual expansion of conflicts into areas not relating to any immediate threat. By narrowing the target, there’s less opportunity for special interests to manipulate our foreign policy to serve the financial needs of the oil and military-weapon industries.

The Logan Act would be repealed, thus allowing maximum freedom of our citizens to volunteer to support their war of choice. This would help diminish the enthusiasm for wars the proponents have used to justify our world policies and diminish the perceived need for a military draft.

If we followed a constitutional policy of non-intervention, we would never have to entertain the aggressive notion of preemptive war based on speculation of what a country might do at some future date. Political pressure by other countries to alter our foreign policy for their benefit would never be a consideration. Commercial interests and our citizens investing overseas could not expect our armies to follow them and protect their profits. A non-interventionist foreign policy would not condone subsidies to our corporations through programs like the Export/Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. These programs guarantee against losses, while the risk takers want our military to protect their investments from political threats. This current flawed policy removes the tough decisions of when to invest in foreign countries and diminishes the pressure on those particular countries to clean up their political acts in order to entice foreign capital to move into their country. Today’s foreign policy encourages bad investments. Ironically this is all done in the name of free trade and capitalism, but it does more to export jobs and businesses than promote free trade. And yet when it fails, capitalism and freedom are blamed.

A non-interventionist foreign policy would go a long way toward preventing 9/11 type attacks. The Department of Homeland Security would be unnecessary, and the military, along with less bureaucracy in our intelligence-gathering agencies, could instead provide the security the new department is supposed to provide. A renewed respect for gun ownership and responsibility for defending one’s property would provide additional protection against potential terrorists.

Conclusion

There are many reasons why a policy of peace is superior to a policy of war. The principle that we do not have the moral authority to forcibly change governments in foreign lands just because we don’t approve of their shortcomings should be our strongest argument — but rarely today is a moral argument in politics worth much.

The practical argument against intervention, because of its record of failure, should certainly prompt all thoughtful people to reconsider what we have been doing for the past many decades.

We should all be aware that war is a failure of relationship between foreign powers. Since this is such a serious matter, our American tradition as established by the founders made certain that the executive is subservient to the more democratically responsive legislative branch on the issue of war. Therefore, no war is ever to be the prerogative of a president through his unconstitutional use of executive orders, nor should it ever be something where the legal authority comes from an international body such as NATO or the United Nations. Up until 50 years ago, this had been the American tradition.

Non-intervention prevents the unexpected and unintended consequences that inevitably result from well-intended meddling in the affairs of others.

Countries like Switzerland and Sweden who promote neutrality and non-intervention have benefited for the most part by remaining secure and free of war over the centuries. Non-intervention consumes a lot less of the nation’s wealth — and with less wars, a higher standard of living for all citizens results. But this, of course, is not attractive to the military-industrial complex, which enjoys a higher standard of living at the expense of the taxpayer when a policy of intervention and constant war preparation is carried out.

Wisdom, morality, and the Constitution are very unlikely to invade the minds of the policy makers that control our foreign affairs. We have institutionalized foreign intervention over the past 100 years through the teachings of all our major universities and the propaganda that the media spews out. The powerful influence over our policy, both domestic and foreign, is not soon going to go away.

I’m convinced however, that eventually restraint in our interventions overseas will be guided by a more reasonable constitutional policy. Economic reality will dictate it. Although political pressure in times of severe economic downturn and domestic strife encourage planned distractions overseas, these adventures always cause economic harm due to the economic costs. When the particular country or empire involved overreaches, as we are currently doing, national bankruptcy and a severely weakened currency call the whole process to a halt.

The Soviet system armed with an aggressive plan to spread its empire worldwide collapsed, not because we attacked it militarily, but for financial and economic reasons. They no longer could afford it, and the resources and wealth that it drained finally turned the people against its authoritarian rule.

Maintaining an overseas empire is incompatible with the American tradition of liberty and prosperity. The financial drain and the antagonism that it causes with our enemies, and even our friends, will finally force the American people to reject the policy outright. There will be no choice. Gorbachev just walked away and Yeltsin walked in, with barely a ripple. A non-violent revolution of unbelievable historic magnitude occurred and the Cold War ended. We are not immune from such a similar change.

This Soviet collapse ushered in the age of unparalleled American dominance over the entire world, and along with it allowed the new expanded hot war between the West and the Muslim East. All the hostility directed toward the West built up over the centuries between the two factions is now directed toward the United States. We are now the only power capable of paying for and literally controlling the Middle East and its cherished wealth, and we have not hesitated. Iraq, with its oil and water and agricultural land, is a prime target of our desire to further expand our dominion. The battle is growing more tense with our acceptance and desire to control the Caspian Sea oil riches. But Russia, now licking its wounds and once again accumulating wealth, will not sit idly by and watch the American empire engulf this region. When time runs out for us, we can be sure Russia will once again be ready to fight for control of all those resources in countries adjacent to her borders. And expect the same for China and India. And who knows, maybe one day even Japan will return to the ancient art of using force to occupy the cherished territories in her region of the world.

The most we can hope for will be, once the errors of our ways are acknowledged and we can no longer afford our militarism, we will reestablish the moral principle that underpins the policy of “peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations, entangling alliances with none.” Our modern-day war hawks do not respect this American principle, nor do they understand how the love of liberty drove the founders in their great battle against tyranny.

We must prepare for the day when our financial bankruptcy and the failure of our effort at world domination are apparent. The solution to such a crisis can be easily found in our Constitution and in our traditions. But ultimately, the love of liberty can only come from a change in the hearts and minds of the people and with an answered prayer for the blessings of divine intervention.

738974,"I was watching Fox News a week ago and I witnessed a bunch of hubbub about how Bush wanted to ""eliminate the income tax"" and replace it with a national sales tax.

It comes as no surprise that the Fox gang would embrace Bush’s proposal. If Bush wants to do something, the people at Fox usually support it, in their own fair and balanced way.

More surprisingly, many libertarians and free-market types not only favor, but spend much of their time advocating, such a reform.

Cutting spending while changing the tax code may very well be better than cutting spending and leaving the oppressive code intact. However, we should be skeptical of plans to change the code drastically while leaving spending rates the same, which is precisely the idea on the table: a ""revenue-neutral"" sales tax. Instead of focusing on the real problem — government is far, far too large and takes far too much of all of our money — a lot of well-meaning Americans have become distracted into putting energy into trying to get the state to steal our money in a different way.

You got to hand it to the Bush Republicans. They might eschew neutrality in foreign affairs, but they love it when it comes to how much loot the government confiscates from us.

Now, taken for granted that a national sales tax would be revenue neutral, we have to consider what would happen if the program came to pass.

If the income tax were to be immediately abolished and replaced with a sales tax, the results could be devastating, especially in the short term. Before the new tax goes into effect, Americans would be motivated to buy as much as they could, far beyond the exchanges that would occur in the natural market. This would cause shortages, price increases, and the perfect atmosphere to blame economic problems on the ""laissez-faire"" tax reformers. Once the tax is implemented, buyers and sellers would be penalized a hefty 20% or more on each exchange. This would discourage trading on the market, and instead incite people to become more economically self-sufficient. The division of labor on which civilization relies would suffer a major blow, as economic activity became far more atomized than optimal in a free market. Furthermore, older folks who saved for their retirement and paid taxes on their income their entire lives would suffer a whole new assault on their livelihoods. Whole industries that are currently free from taxation would also take a beating, once the Internet is taxed, which is part of the sales taxes being contemplated.

Since it would likely be a gradualist reform, the introduction of a new national sales tax and the ""phasing out"" of income tax might well lead, ultimately, to Americans being saddled with both. One of the arguments for an income tax was that it would lead to lower tariffs. However, some of America’s highest tariffs came after the establishment of an income tax. Since the government no longer depended on tariffs for all their revenue, politicians were able to jack them up as high as they wanted, for protectionist purposes, without worry that revenues from tariffs would sink because overtaxed Americans decided to buy fewer products from overseas.

Republicans (Lincoln, William Taft, Hoover, et al.) deserve credit for giving us both the income tax and the high protective tariff. We should hesitate to trust them with establishing yet another kind of government theft, no matter how much they promise to reduce the burden of the other kinds they have introduced in the past.

(Another incidental problem with the national sales tax is its Constitutionality. It is not clear how so many technicalitarian opponents of the income tax can confidently assert that the 16th Amendment was never ratified or that it never meant to tax American citizens but that, for some reason, it is okay to implement a national sales tax that is nowhere to be found in any of the Constitution’s amendments, properly ratified or not.)

So what are the arguments for a revenue-neutral national sales tax? One is that the government would somehow become more friendly, less invasive and intrusive, and more respectful of our rights. Such a prospect is pure comedy! If the government is still poking its nose in all the retail stores in the country, auditing their records and treating people as guilty until proven innocent — which are the preferred tactics when the government is trying to collect trillions of dollars of revenue — we can expect no more privacy or freedom from a sales tax regime than what we now have.

Another argument for the idea is that a national sales tax will encourage saving. But free-market advocates should realize that the government should not take on the role of encouraging or discouraging any economic behavior. Saving should happen voluntarily, and reflect the personal preferences of the savers in a free market.

Yet another argument contends that sales taxes are somehow more voluntary than income taxes, because people have to earn an income but they don’t have to buy goods and services. This is a bizarre line of reasoning, seeing as how the selling of labor and goods are technically both voluntary, and yet any taxes on them are not.

The most frequent, and perhaps the worst, argument in free-market circles is that the poor would finally pay their fair share. The reasoning further goes that if the poor have to finance a higher percentage of the state’s activities, and if such a tax is visible and apparent every time they buy something, the nation’s poor will have more incentive to shrink the state and not support social programs.

This is just like the cynical argument for the draft! If the nation’s affluent have to see their kids die in Iraq, maybe they’ll oppose the war, so goes the argument. We should keep in mind that if a draft comes, the statists imposing it will not have an antiwar agenda, nor will the statists imposing a sales tax have a tax-cutting agenda. And the pro-tax anti-state argument makes just as little sense as the pro-draft antiwar argument, once put under a moment’s worth of scrutiny.

First of all, it’s not fair to assume that poor people are the principal reason we have a growing government that is readily approaching a total state. It’s not the poor who are in power, who have brought the US federal budget to nearly two and a half trillion dollars with Medicare expansions, explosions in education spending, agricultural pork programs, and a massive warfare state. And even if the poor tended to believe in Big Government, taxing them more wouldn’t do any good. It’s not like they would all of a sudden call their Senators, say they opposed the new expansions of government, after all, and that the government need not grow anymore on their account. It’s not as if the Senators would listen.

Secondly, the poor already pay more in taxes than they should. They pay regressive taxes to the rotten Social Security Administration and to their state governments all the time. The rich are also overtaxed. So is the middle class. And no matter how the government decides to extract twenty percent of the GDP from the productive sector, it will inevitably destroy the wealth of all peaceful participants in the market economy. Just as taxing the rich hurts the poor, so too does taxing the poor hurt all of us. The real problem, once again, is too much government — not that the wrong people are being victimized.

Besides, if we do see a national sales tax, it will likely come with all sorts of gimmicks to relieve the poor of some of the burden, including a check to every American to pay sales tax on basic necessities. So much for making people feel less dependent on the government!

The common arguments for a revenue-neutral sales tax — that in the long run it will increase revenue, or reduce it; that it will shift the burden, or offset the new burdens by eliminating old ones; that it will simplify the tax code and yet have enough built-in mechanisms to soften the blow against fixed-income earners — are quite inconsistent.

However the government taxes us, it is way too big, and it isn’t that way only because of the poor, or the rich, or the Republicans or the Democrats. The reasons it is too big are more complicated than that. One reason is that Americans have become divided against each other by the political process, and instead of focusing their animosity and energy on reducing the power of the institution that has divided us, many of us blame one group or the other, and fall into the trap of trying to use the state against those that we perceive are using it against us now. Such divisive political activism allows the state to expand, widens oppression, and fails to address the fundamental problem. Attempts to reform the tax code are often manifestations of this kind of division.

If we really want taxes to be less painful, we need to cut spending. We could eliminate almost all federal taxes entirely if the government simply obeyed its Constitutional limits, and the remaining taxes, whatever form they took, would be quite tolerable by today’s standards. Moving halfway toward Constitutional government, which would still leave intact a system about as big as we had during the end of the Reagan administration, would be enough to scrap federal income taxes entirely, and any step in this direction would reduce the real burdens of government on the taxpayer and do more good than switching from an income tax to a revenue-neutral sales tax.

Bush and the Republicans probably do not want to cut government at all, so we shouldn’t fall for their Republican trick of ""tax reform."" Spending increasers make bad tax cutters. Taxes can never be fair or economically neutral or sound. They can, however, be lower — but only if the government is made smaller. Unless and until Bush reduces the size of government, libertarians have little reason to celebrate any of his huckstering tax ""reforms.""

466333,"Recently by Charles Goyette: Something Wicked This Way Comes

White House polling must show how badly gas prices are hurting Obama’s approval numbers. Badly enough that he’s even trying to ease up on attacking Iran.

Here’s Obama on the campaign trail: ""The problem is … speculators and people make various bets, and they say, you know what, we think that maybe there’s a 20% chance that something might happen in the Middle East that might disrupt oil supply, so we’re going to bet that oil is going to go up real high. And that spikes up prices significantly.""

While blaming economic conditions on speculators is the common stock in trade of demagogues and politicians of all stripes, what is the president actually saying?

People who need energy to keep their businesses working, business that make modern life possible, look around at world events and grow concerned that the U.S. government and others may conspire to interrupt the flow of oil. Behaving like good stewards of their enterprises, they and their agents seek to assure needed oil supplies in an uncertain future by contracting for tomorrow’s oil needs today.

While Obama deprecates the activity, saying that those trying to prepare for future conditions, are ""betting,"" most oil users would actually prefer stable prices and would just as soon forego the guessing game about future prices. It’s a game that costs them if they are wrong and only allows them to stay in business if they are right. Most are happy that someone  those speculators politicians love to vilify  are willing to take on the risk of being wrong about future price movements for the rewards of being right. The real oil users can then count on liquid markets when they need them and keep their attention  and their capital  focused on delivering the blessings of modern life instead of betting on the movement of prices.

And there is something wrong with this? Hold the phone a moment!

It’s not as though those seeking to secure oil for their future needs are making something up. They’re not concerned about some fantasy development, some exogenous agent like space aliens appearing out of nowhere to suck up all of earth’s oil. This isn’t science fiction. They’re trying to keep things working in the face of very real and very familiar government threats to our way of life.

Maybe they should be praised, not condemned.

While one administration bureaucrat has claimed there is a ""Wall Street premium"" on the price of oil, it takes government to make a war. Speculators trying to anticipate future prices in the event of a war don’t impose embargos. Nor do they launch airstrikes.

In The Dollar Meltdown, I estimated that during the constant saber rattling and elective wars of the Bush years, the fear premium on the price of oil may have run from $$20 to $$40 a barrel, depending on developments. It was, in any case, a huge transfer of wealth from the American people to the oil sheikdoms, Putin’s Russia, and Chavez’s Venezuela.

If Obama is prepared to further de-capitalize the American people and deliver another blow to an economically-depressed world by supporting an Israeli strike on Iran and risking the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, isn’t it a good thing that he has to confront at least some of the cost of such recklessness?

He’s a politician. He should pay a political price.

George W. Bush never did. But we would be better off economically if he had to reckon with the price for his elective war.

Might Bush have been dissuaded from his unnecessary war if he had known that it would cost not under $$50 billion, as his administration claimed, but more like $$5 trillion?

Would Bush have given up plans for his counterproductive war on Iraq  a war that has only consolidated Iran’s Shi’ite power bloc in the region  if he had known that he would preside over an explosion of the nation’s visible debt from $$5.7 trillion to $$10.6 trillion?

Would Bush have foregone his wasteful war justified by forged documents and phony intelligence if he had known that its cost would help trigger the steepest downturn in America since the Great Depression, even as the cost of the Vietnam War helped create the stagflation decade of the 1970s?

If he had known the costs and the outcome, would Bush have been capable of better decisions?

Nah. Bush was not capable of forethought or making wise decisions. When he ran for reelection in 2004, Americans still hadn’t come to terms with the monstrosity of his bogus war. And his opponent, John Kerry (""Reporting for duty!"") wasn’t willing to risk defeat by opposing the prevailing war fever. Had he done so, he would have still lost in 2004, but could have easily been elected on the ""told you so"" platform by the time people began seeing through Bush’s war in 2008.

Whatever Obama’s real view about war with Iran, he at least has enough foresight to know that it will result in even higher gas prices.

At his first press conference of 2012, Obama responded to a question about gas prices with a question of his own, asking the reporter, ""Do you think the President of the United States going into reelection wants gas prices to go up higher? Is there anybody here who thinks that makes a lot of sense?""

Obama knows that the price at the pump can cost him the election.

If it is wariness about the political cost of higher oil prices that has Obama preferring ""engagement"" to bombing Iran, it is a good thing. If it is speculators buying oil against future possibilities that keep Obama from reacting as Romney and the neocon Republicans egg him to start another needless and ruinous war, then we owe speculators a debt of gratitude.

459012,"Recently by Sherwood Ross: The CIA: Beyond Redemption and Should BeTerminated

President Obama  as well as his mother, father, step-father and grandmother  all were connected to the Central Intelligence Agency  possibly explaining why the President praises the Agency and declines to prosecute its officials for their crimes.

According to a published report in the September Rock Creek Free Press of Washington, D.C., investigative reporter Wayne Madsen says Obamas mother Ann Dunham worked on behalf of a number of CIA front operations, including the East-West Center at the University of Hawaii, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Ford Foundation. The East-West Center had long been affiliated with CIA activities in the Asia-Pacific region, Madsen says.

Whats more, Obamas father, Barack Obama Sr., arrived in Hawaii from Kenya as part of a CIA program to identify and train Africans who would be useful to the Agency in its Cold War operations against the Soviets, Madsen says. Obama Sr. divorced Ms. Dunham in 1964.

Ms. Dunham married Lolo Soetoro the following year, a man Madsen says assisted in the violent CIA coup against Indonesian President Sukarno that claimed a million lives. Obamas mother taught English for USAID, which was a major cover for CIA activities in Indonesia and throughout Southeast Asia, Madsen reports. That USAID was a cover for CIA covert operations in Laos was admitted by its administrator Dr. John Hannah on Metromedia News. Madsen says the organization was also a cover for the CIA in Indonesia.

Ms. Dunham worked in Indonesia at a time when Midwest Universities Consortium for International Activities(MUCIA)  a group that included the University of Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan State, Minnesota and Indiana  was accused of being a front for CIA activities in Indonesia and elsewhere. Ms. Dunham traveled to Ghana, Nepal, Bangladesh, India and Thailand working on micro-financing projects for the CIA, Madsen reports.

And Ms. Dunhams mother, Madelyn Dunham  who raised Obama while his mother was on assignment in Indonesia  acted as vice president of the Bank of Hawaii in Honolulu, which Madsen says was used by various CIA front entities. She handled escrow accounts used to make CIA payments to U.S.-supported Asian dictators including Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu, and President Suharto in Indonesia, Madsen says.

In effect, the bank was engaged in money laundering for the CIA to prop up covertly its favored leaders in the Asia-Pacific region, Madsen writes. It is clear that Dunham Soetoro and her Indonesian husband, President Obamas step-father, were closely involved in the CIAs operations to steer Indonesia away from the Sino-Soviet orbit after the overthrow of Sukarno.

President Obamas own work in 1983 for Business International Corporation, a CIA front that conducted seminars with the worlds most powerful leaders and used journalists as agents abroad, dovetails with CIA espionage activities conducted by his mother, Madsen says. There are volumes of written material on the CIA backgrounds of George H.W. Bush and CIA-related activities by his father and children, including former President George W. Bush. Barack Obama, on the other hand, cleverly masked his own CIA connections as well as those of his mother, father, step-father, and grandmother, Madsen points out.

A review of the influence on the Oval Office by the CIA, particularly since the presidency of Bush Sr., a former director of the Agency, it becomes apparent the Agency has played a major role in the shaping of U.S. foreign policy  a role that has been largely kept secret from the American public and one which most Americans would not have approved. The CIAs overthrow of the democratic government of Iran in 1953 is an example. The overthrow occurred after the Iranian government nationalized the oil industry following alleged cheating on payments by contractor British Petroleum, then known as Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. For another, the CIAs widespread use of illegal rendition and torture of suspects is repugnant to Americans who still believe in their Constitution.

217974,"“Rien ne saurait interrompre les actions généreusement bienfaisantes de la France en Indochine.” (Nothing can stop the generous good works of France in Indochina [Vietnam].)

~ Indo-China Governor-General Pierre Pasquier, 1930

A joke made its way around the Internet following the train bombings in Madrid:

“In response to the terrorism events in Madrid, the French government announced a change in its alert status…from ‘run’ to ‘hide.’ If the threat worsens, the French may be forced to increase their level of security, declaring a move to ‘surrender’ or ‘collaboration’ status as events develop.”

One of the many conceits Americans permit themselves is that they bravely face up to the world’s terrorist menace, while others — most notably, the French — cower in fear.

Elsewhere, in the International Herald Tribune, comes a letter to the editor in which the writer takes issue with an apparently widespread report that John Kerry is worried about looking “too French” and that this is a sign of “weakness” in the eyes of the lumpen voters.

We stop still in our tracks. We hold our breath. There must be a price to be paid for such arrogant dumbo-ism. But Americans are ready to believe anything — if it flatters them.

Anyone who has ever cracked open a history book couldn’t help but know that French history is drenched in blood. When it came to butchering each other, what the Gaullic tribes didn’t know about it probably wasn’t worth knowing. And then, there were the wars with the Romans…and with the English…and religious wars…and wars with between princes…between kingdoms…wars for no reason. Weakness? Cowardice? A group of Norman French fighters no bigger than a small-town police force invaded and captured all of England. Bonaparte took on all of Europe…and almost beat them all.

General Marbot records an incident in the campaign against Russia in which a group of French soldiers is cut off from the main force, but visible from the Emperor’s commandpost. Realizing that they could not expect reinforcements, the brigade sent a message to Bonaparte — ‘We, who are about to die, salute you.’ Then, they fought to the last man.

Later this month comes the anniversary of the Battle of Camerone. Napoleon’s nephew sent troops to Mexico in the 1860s. In the action surrounding the siege of Puebla, a group of 60 French foreign legionnaires was cut off and confronted by an army of 2,000 Mexicans. The Mexican commander asked for a surrender. Instead, the French vowed to fight to the last man. Trapped in an inn, the soldiers had nothing to eat or drink. Then, the Mexicans set the place on fire.

“In spite of the heat and smoke,” explains a report on the Internet, “the legionnaires resisted, but many of them were killed or injured. By 5 pm on April 30, 1863, only 12 men could still fight with 2nd Lieutenant Maudet. At this time, the Mexican colonel gathered his soldiers and told them what a disgrace it would be if they were unable to defeat such a small number of men. The Mexicans were about to give the general assault through the holes opened in the walls of the courtyard…[they] once again asked Lieutenant Maudet to surrender. Once again, Maudet scornfully refused.

“The final charge was given. Soon, only 5 men were left around Maudet; Corporal Maine, legionnaires Catteau, Wensel, Constantin, and Leonard. Each had only one bullet left. In a corner of the courtyard, their backs against the wall, still facing the enemy, they fixed bayonets. When the signal was given, they opened fired and fought with their bayonets. Luitenant Maudet and 2 legionnaires fell, mortally wounded. Maine, along with his 2 remaining companions, were about to be slaughtered when a Mexican officer saved them. He shouted: ‘Surrender!’

“‘We will, only if you promise to allow us to carry and care for our injured men and if you leave us our guns.’

“‘Nothing can be refused to men like you,’ answered the officer.”

And this spring also marks the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Writer Graham Greene visited the French just before the shooting started. He found them well supplied — with 48,000 bottles of wine. But after the Vietnamese terrorists captured the airstrips, the French were cut off and doomed. Still, they held out — hoping a diplomatic solution could be found. It did not come.

After a 56-day siege, French general de Castries radioed his superior in Hanoi: “I’m blowing up the installations. The ammunition dumps are already exploding. Au revoir.”

“Well then,” came the reply, “au revoir, mon vieux.”

After the fall of Indo-China, the French renounced their “civilizing mission” foreign policy. Now, it is America that tromps over the planet, claiming to make the world a better place.

But when it comes to blockheaded bellicosity and desperate courage, Americans have nothing to teach the French.

In comparison to Napoleon’s grand campaigns, America’s early wars were piddling, tawdry affairs. Its wars against the Mexicans and Spaniards, for example, were more sordid than glorious. Even its Revolutionary War was merely a minor engagement in comparison to the Napoleonic wars, and only won because the French intervened at a crucial moment to pull Americans’ chestnuts out of the fire. Here, we quote Charles W. Eliot’s history, in which he describes how the patriots had fallen “into a condition of despondency from which nothing but the steadfastness of Washington and the Continental army and the aid from France saved them.”

In WWI, the French battered themselves against the Germans for two years — and suffered more casualties than America had in all its wars put together — before Pershing ever set foot in France. Again, in WWII, Americans waited until the combatants had been softened up…before entering the war with an extraordinary advantage in fresh soldiers and almost unlimited supplies.

Americans have no history. Probably just as well. The French, on the other hand, have too much. Practically every street in Paris reminds them of a slaughter somewhere. Upon the Arc de Triomphe, Les Invalides, and dozens of other piles of stone, the names of towns in Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland, Russia…or North Africa…are inscribed. Each one marks the deaths of thousands of French soldiers — gone early to their graves for who-remembers-what important national purpose. Every town in France, even the most remote and forlorn little burg, has at its center a pillar of granite or marble — with the names of the men whose bodies were torn to bit by flying lead or corroded by some battlefield disease. A whole race of orphans grew up after WWI…and special seats on the subway were designated for those “mutilated in war” including thousands of “sans gueules” — men who had had their jaws blown away and yet survived, too horrible to look upon.

The French have had enough of war — at least for now. Let them enjoy a well-earned cowardice. We will get our chance.

Early last month, the Georgia legislature approved a bill to change the state flag, and the governor signed the bill into law. So now, we Georgians have a new state flag.

Or do we? The market, it appears, has vetoed the flag change.

Oh, the new flag will soon be flying atop government buildings. But since the government changed the state flag, sales of the old state flag  a pretty flag which displays the Georgia state emblem behind a field of blue on its left side and the Confederate battle flag on its right  have gone through the roof. So have sales of t-shirts, swim suits, license plates, belt buckles, bumper stickers, glassware, and numerous other items emblazoned with the Confederate battle flag.

Collectibles is a firm here in Glynn County that sells old state flags, new state flags, and an assortment of Confederate battle flag paraphernalia. The proprietors of Collectibles report that, since the government adopted the new state flag, sales of the old state flag, as well as battle flag emblazoned paraphernalia, are up 40 to 50 percent.

Sheffield's, an establishment 45 miles up the road in Wayne County, has seen a similar increase in its sales of old state flags and battle flag paraphernalia.

And The Cavalier Shoppe, a retail and mail order firm in Bruce, Mississippi, reports a whopping increase in orders from Georgians, primarily for the old state flag, but also for battle flag items. (The Cavalier Shoppe also reports a sharp increase in sales of Mississippi state flags. Later this year, Mississippians will vote on whether or not to change their own state flag.)

Neither Collectibles, Sheffield's, nor The Cavalier Shoppe has received a single order for the new Georgia flag.

Some Georgians are buying the old state flag as a keepsake. But the increase in sales of battle flag paraphernalia indicates that something much deeper than nostalgia is behind the increase in demand for the old state flag. Indeed, in the residential sections of Glynn County, old state flags are now flying where no flags flew before.

The Georgia state flag episode is a first-order case of the Law of Unintended Consequences. The state flag was changed to make the Confederate battle flag less visible. But by shrinking the battle flag to a speck on the new state flag, the governor and the legislature stirred some dormant passions. Now, the battle flag is more visible around the state than ever before.

Our state flag episode also reveals how markets are making government increasingly irrelevant in American society.

People like to think that the essence of democratic government is choice. But democratic government is still government, and government at its core is an instrument of compulsion and coercion. The US government forces us to pay up on April 15 and plenty of other times during a year whether we ordered its services or not. And that's a democratically elected government. Imagine what happens when government is less constrained. (Of course, we know what happens when government is less constrained. For details, see The Black Book of Communism.)

Elections don't change the essence of government. Elections merely grant the majority its choice from a slim menu of tyrants.

But the essence of markets  and the freedom that private property rights bring  is choice. Nobody in a market can pull the kind of coercive stunts that government pulls.

And over the years, the range of choices that markets have made available to people has exploded.

The amazing increase in the types of consumer goods now available  from grocery store items to running shoes to web sites  is apparent to all. Perhaps less noticeable but far more significant is the growth of market substitutes for goods that many believe only government can provide.

As government plods along, markets are honing in on government and its protected domain. And people are increasingly choosing the markets' options.

More and more people are circumventing the government's postal monopoly by paying their bills through financial companies or over the internet. More and more parents are pulling their children out of government schools to enroll them in private schools, or to home school, an increasingly attractive option thanks to all the resources markets have made available to home-schooling parents.

Not only are people increasingly resorting to markets to supersede government, they are increasingly making market choices to protect themselves against some of government's more serious failures. To protect against Social Security's going bust, they invest more in mutual funds. To protect themselves and their property when government doesn't seem up to the job, they buy weapons and security services provided by markets.

And now, when people don't like the government's new flag, they go to the market and buy and fly the flag they prefer. That's what has happened here in Georgia. The market has overridden the governor and the legislature and has retained the old state flag.
