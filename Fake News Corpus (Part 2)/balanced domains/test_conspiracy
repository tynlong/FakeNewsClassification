Everything you said but the above is true. Our stomachs do not contain the nec enzymes to digest RAW flesh. Carnivores (animals) do not cook their food they eat raw flesh. Human ingenuity figured out that cooking, and marinading it made it easier to digest.



Try to replace the amount of meat you eat now with just raw meat for as little as a week, and watch what happens.



We ARE omnivores, not trying to dispute that, but we do not share the same enzymes concentration as most true carnivores.

Actually, many humans do. There are many primitive societies in the world that do still eat raw meat. They eat the meat almost right after they have killed it. So while perhaps people in western cultures, who have been eating cooked meat for generations might have somewhat weaker stomach acids, there are other people in other cultures who eat a good amount of raw meat, and they do not get sick or have trouble digesting it.As far as marinating goes, I eat meat that is not marinated quite frequently and have no problems. Many cultures eat it without marinades as well. Marinating meat is not required to eat it, I dont know where people get that from. Marinating it just makes it very tasty.As far as health goes, eating meat everyday, three meals a day, is not good for you. Thats excess. And that goes for many different types of food. But all this nonsense that completely wiping out meat from your diet is going to make you live a longer and healthier life is nonsense. I have lost faith in most medical studies anyway, and instead, look to real life. My great grandmother, who was a farmer her whole life, ate meat practically every day and lived to be 96, and during those last years she was still sharp mentally and physically. They key is balance and moderation. She ate quite a bit of meat. She also ate alot of fresh veggies, and did not sit on her butt and watch Tv and get fat, but was often zipping around her farm, keeping active and doing her chores.She is by no means an exceptional case. Most of the people anywhere that Ive met who are past their 80's and in good health. Im yet to meet a vegetarian who was that old, though Im sure there are a few. Eating meat doesn't shorten your lifespan or reduce quality of life. What makes one healthy and live longer is an active life, moderation and enjoyment in all things, and generally, a positive, low stress lifestyle.If people dont want to eat dead animals, then don't. But perhaps its that lack of meat-vitamins that makes veggies think that somehow, we are going to be swayed by their arguements. The only arguements I support is of course, how the animals are fed and raised. I believe cows should not be kept in factory like setting and fed grain, but instead should be allowed to eat grass. Natural free range cow meat does taste better, Ive noticed, perhaps because there is less fat and gristle on them, and more meat. but I certainly do not wish to end raising food animals period, just change how the animals are raised and fed.Cows are prey animals, and we are hunters. Cows exist to be eaten by predators, and we are those predators.By the way, I have both hunted and killed animals I have eaten, from rattlesnakes to deer, so yes, i have actually killed an animal and eaten it, and I do not feel bad about it, since I didnt cause the animals in question to suffer by giving them a quick shot to the head.I still dont see any credible, reliable evidence that humans are meant to be vegetarians, or that eating meat in moderation will kill you more than other things will. We all die some day, and with the time we have, we should enjoy ourselves by eating good food and drinking good drinks.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In Apology, Plato relates that:



[1] […] οὖτος μὲν οἴεταί τι εἰδέναι οὐκ εἰδώς, ἐγὼ δέ, ὥσπερ οὖν οὐκ οἶδα, οὐδὲ οἴμαι — This man, on one hand, believes that he knows something, while not knowing [anything]. On the other hand, I - equally ignorant - do not believe [that I know anything].



The impreciseness of the paraphrase of this as ""I know that I know nothing"" stems from the fact that the author is not saying that he does not know anything but means instead that one cannot know anything with absolute certainty but can feel confident about certain things.[2] This may be better exemplified in another translation, that is perhaps more correct, ""I am only wise insofar as what I don't know, I don't think I know""





* False words are not only evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil.



o Phædo 91



* In every one of us there are two ruling and directing principles, whose guidance we follow wherever they may lead; the one being an innate desire of pleasure; the other, an acquired judgment which aspires after excellence.



Awareness10, first thanks for coming by and checking out the thread. I hope it had some positive effect on you. This was the point of it in the first place.I would like to start by saying that even this thread is words that I had put together from reading other words. A big ball of light gave me a kick start to go on this quest.This is what most of us have to work with, words, and a natural deep seeded questioning of our existence. Sometimes we might be thrown nuggets of knowledge that hit us in just the right place that just rings our psyche to our core. This is when our nous, knowledge, intuitions kick in.The videos on the other thread were done obviously by a studier of the Hermetic school of thought. While the words, even for me at times, seem to give us the ""answers"", do they really?The only real answers are inside of yourself, your faith in other words.We can search and search for ""the answer"" but it can be a thing that could take the rest of our lives reading about.I also REALLY believe that no Operation or science will prove these things to us. This is a fools journey.One of my favorite quotes supposedly by Socrate's, who some say was a disciple of Hermes himself.Socrates left no writing of his own, but his disciple Plato, left these words for us in reference to his teacher.""I know that I know nothing"".Here is another quote from Plato:So with that, It always keeps me in check.Go with your faith and nothing more and the answers will come to you.I am guilty myself of thinking I know too much at times too.Thanks to the Wise person who keeps opening my eyes.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It appears, the police say, that James E. Holmes, the man accused in the Aurora shootings, used all three types of weapons inside the theater as well, first firing the shotgun, then using the semiautomatic rifle until its 100-round barrel magazine jammed, and finishing off with a pistol. (A second .40-caliber pistol was also found at the scene, though it was unclear whether it had been used in the theater.)



Oates said Holmes purchased 6,000 rounds of ammunition and multiple magazines, including a drum magazine able to hold 100 cartridges, from stores and on the Internet.

Let me bring something up that I have noticed from the crime scene photos that have been released from the tragedy that is the Aurora, Colorado shooting. We have heard over the past week many reports (listed below) about the weaponry that the alleged shooter had with him. These include the following:1) Remington 870 12 Gauge Tactical Shotgun2) Smith & Wesson M&P15 Assault Rifle with a 100 Round Drum Magazine3) Glock .40 cal handgunSo it was stated that not only did the alleged shooter carry an “semi-automatic assault rifle”, but that he had a “100 round drum magazine” on it, which subsequently jammed. This has been stated as fact by many news outlets, police reports, and of course politicians who are using this fact as a reason to move forward on this revived talk of gun control. To many, this is the issue, that he was able to carry so many rounds to inflict damage before having to reload.But my question to you is, where is the 100 round drum magazine? Look at this picture below from the crime scene:Now, take a look at these pictures of a 100 round drum magazine for the type of weapon that supposedly had this 100 round drum magazine:I have looked at this picture over and over, and there is no way I see this gun having one of these magazines on it. I even showed this picture to a friend of mine that is fairly knowledgeable about guns, and I didn’t mention a thing about the magazine. He took one look at it and the first thing he says is “That isn’t a 100 round magazine”. Of course from a political stance, this higher capacity magazine certainly makes it much more dramatic, and helpful to the gun control cause than a standard capacity magazine of 30 or 40 rounds, right? But I don’t see in that picture, and I know it isn’t the best picture, but I don’t see that gun having a 100 round drum on it. It is laying pretty flat on the ground, not at an angle as one would think it would lay if it had this drum on it. But again, after looking at this picture over and over, I still don’t see this with anything other than a standard magazine. No shadows of it laying at an angle at all. Sure, maybe it is just how I am looking at it, and others may see differently, but tell me I am wrong here. Am I?Could this be a complete and blatant lie by the mainstream media as part of the gun control push? Or, is this just a simple mistake in the reporting, which there has been a lot of, and in reality he just didn’t have that type of magazine? Something is up with this, and after reading all the reports of what he was carrying, this seems to be a rather large mistake here. Any thoughts on this?Peace be to all the victims and families of the victims in this horrible event.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

None of this demonstrates that Darwinism is false. It does, however, mean that the claim that it is the cornerstone of modern experimental biology will be met with quiet skepticism from a growing number of scientists in fields where theories actually do serve as cornerstones for tangible breakthroughs.

Well . . . after reading this thread and all of the links posted to this point, I'm a little disappointed that there was nothing of substance offered. Although, that is fairly common for this forum and those that challenge the fact of evolution. However, the article in the OP is interesting in it's own right, as giant/colossal squid are such a new field of intense study.First, the OP offers no challenge to existing Evolutionary Theory, as others have stated. The fact that the authors have found that all specimens tested confirm one species, despite worldwide distribution means nothing really. In the same way that humans are the same species and also have world wide distribution, doesn't throw Evolutionary Theory into question. Morphology is a red herring in this case, although pointed out by the researchers, also in the same way it doesn't point to speciation among humans. Darwins observations on speciation took place over 150yrs ago and we have advanced past that, thanks to genetic verification of species, so they don't come into play. DNA analysis confirms a single species . . . nothing odd about that. The evidence about mutation rate in the DNA evidence is intriguing and should be studied further. The researchers hypothesize a answer to this evidence, i.e. bottleneck, however there are other possiblities. The thing to remember here is we have only been able to really study this species of squid over the last decade, or so, as we have only now begun to identify their habitat and study accordingly. It's quite possible that ""years of folklore"" were based on a now extinct relative and today's giant squid are relatively new, as a species. Contridictions to previous hypotheses don't bring down an entire field of study . . . only modify based on new evidence.As for the other links provided . . . all I see is selective association and confirmation bias to support a preconceived opinion that Evolutionary Theory is ""a farce"". And again, opinion pieces and ""contridictions"" to current hypotheses don't challenge the fact of evolution, which has 165yrs of evidence to support it. Furthermore, the claims that those have made to their ""studies"" of evolution are not backed whatsoever by anything except argumentum ad ignorantiam and ad hominem opinions. The one's making the claim have the onus probandi, as they are asserting to Evolutionary Theory being ""a farce"". There are mountains of evidence that support Evolutionary Theory from a wide range of disciplines and it is up to those who disagree with that evidence to show why that evidence is not supportive. To claim their postion is right and it is up to supporters of Evolutionary Theory to ""provide editional evidence"" because of findings that contridict curreny beliefs is childish and shows a great ignorance of science, in general, and how it advances.The link about the enzymes starts with a opinion for a premise to begin with. That evolutionary processes always tend towards economy cannot be found anywhere other than the first line of this article. I'm not sure if that was implied by the researchers to give ""sexiness"" to their findings or by the author of the article. A simple google search of this ""principle"" would have shown this, so to give this as evidence of the ""unraveling of Evolutionary Theory"" is intellectually dishonest. I'm assuming this notion comes from the work of Dawkins, who once stated ""genetic replication makes use of energy and substrates that are supplied by the metabolic economy in much greater quantities than would be possible without a genetic division of labour"". However, this does not support the article's assumptions. Also, no other mention can be found of this ""principle"" that isn't in reference to this article and come from a ID/Creationist website. While interesting and worthy of further research this is, again, simply new findings that must be studied further to figure out exactly what the researchers claim ""what is the evolutionary advantage of more complex RNA"" . . . if there even is an advantage. More confirmation bias and childish clinging by the ID/Creationist crowd.The second link is pure opinion and not uncommon amongst scientists with competing claims. They are human and have egos, like the rest of us. It's also more of a criticism on modern biology and it experimental (or lack there of) nature than saying ""evolution does not happen"", as stated here:To take this article as the latter is a misinterpretation of the opinion piece and, again, confirmation bias of one's ""disbelief"" in Evolutionary Theory.I get a chuckle at the ""open mind"" and ""thinking"" comments . . . very ironic",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You profess to know so much about science



you're acting like you don't even know how the scientific method works in principle.



Not to mention the inherent corruptibility of ""publish or perish"" and other aspects of science (you might try graduate study at a university someday; it's very revealing).



Anyway, this is beside the point. I know you did not mean ""anything a scientist says is Gospel"", so it would be unfair of me to impute that on you. All I'm saying for that is, you might want to watch your wording in the future.





What I would like to know then is, what exactly do you mean by this? What exactly does ""science"" (I like how you treat ""it"" like some monolithic entity, but that is not surprising since you seem to have invested ""it"" with the emotions typically reserved for religion)



say about conscious experience?



You're in the thread whose very purpose was to ask for the answer you apparently have. You have not given the answer.



What I mean is, you seem to be saying, ""Because science can build a car, it's right about consciousness"".



You ask and I decline. I trust personal experience over nth-hand written word any day of the week (especially since the latter is a form of my personal experience, as everything I know is). Every step forward I have made in my life has been in no small part due to trusting my own senses and intuition. Sorry, no can do.



This does not follow at all, but what it does reveal is your agenda. This thread has not been about deities.



No I didn't, nor would I ever claim to know a lot about science.I understand the scientific method just fine. I just wish all these metaphysical claims understood it well enough themselves. I mean, I'm pretty sure the scientific method is not a method that allows one to make an arbitrary claim of truth without some form of evidence or experimentation to prove the claim is indeed truth.Yep, that's human politics for ya, and I don't mean that as in just government type politics. High school drama never ends!Or you could try not reading thing's that don't exist causing unnecessary replies of I know this isn't what you implied buuut I'm gunna say it anyways cuz I don't have any real argument against it. Just saying...I'm just talking about science in general, not as an ""it"" or an entity with emotions (come on, that would just be silly wouldn't it?), but as a method of discovering what makes reality tick. Our science is based upon the universe being an objective material reality, and thus far every aspect of this has brought many wonderful useful discoveries. On the other end of the spectrum we have this metaphysical idealist theories that have shown no evidence for their claimed ""truths"", all experiments shown these phenomena as hoaxed or inclusive or false. I'm sorry if I bash these trains of thoughts, but they have provided nothing of value except dvd and book sales.What is the definition of consciousness? Answer me that and I'll answer your question. Seems to me most people don't understand what consciousness really is and are under the mistaken impression that it's your sole identity, the thing that makes you uniquely you. Look up the definition and get back to me.I've been discussing this in another thread as well, but with people who claim the opposite to be true. They too fail to provide an idealistic answer to consciousness. Again, I feel this is due to not understanding what consciousness means and what it is.That's not what I'm implying at all. There are many theories that I don't personally subscribe to, such as the big bang model for example. I don't worship everything science says as if it were holy scripture. Yet when material science provides useful technologies based upon it's material discoveries, how can I arbitrarily discredit those achievements and claim that consciousness could never be a material phenomenon or that the universe doesn't exist as a material universe?What exactly has idealistic theories of reality provided us? Squat!Would you trust personal experience if inebriated or under hallucinogens? Would you trust it well enough to hop in a vehicle and drive through a crowded section of town?What a bull crap cop out. If I am to trust your personal experience because you claim your personal experience is incapable of being false to such a degree that you firmly believe it to show the true nature of reality then by default you and I would have to trust the personal experiences of everyone else, be it about deities, psychic claims, time travel claims, abduction claims.Here is the reality of our world.

Most assuredly, you have that box firmly on your head. If you can't trust yourself, but must rely on external sources for verifying what is 'right' and 'wrong', then the NWO bunch has you just where they want you, at the mercy of their interpretation of everything and in the end, you are no better than any religion addict who must hear the 'truth' from an external source be it the bible or their minister or some other superior 'holy' person. The only difference is you must hear it from someone like a 'scientist' or a investigative reporter...And the NWO bunch will never tell you about 'color', in fact they will insist, just as you do, that color is just a myth and anyone who says differently is delusional or crazy or a conspiracy nut or just plain whacko... *shakes head* They have spent a lot of time and money to make sure that you believe them, although they know it is a lie. They see color just fine.. they just don't want YOU to.And offering advice about how not to appear to be such a troll is hardly 'censorship'. Sheesh. It is advice, pure and simple. Take or leave it.. it is my observation of your behavior and what you might do to avoid the attendant stress of having to deal, in your opinion, with us 'whackos' and your incessant need to 'correct' us. *rolls eyes*And no, I don't have a masters degree.. I have a double masters degree--in systems counseling. Part of why I am sure of the level of personal growth I have achieved. That program was tough.. you had to show that you understood the emotional competency skills, and that you could and were actually applying them in your own life. IF you didn't, you failed. Even if you got all the 'right' answers, it didn't matter if you couldn't apply it to yourself; they firmly believed if you don't have your ducks lined up, how the heck can you really help anyone else line up theirs even if you have all the right 'theories'???And I am sorry if you can't find anything special about yourself---that you have to be just one of a million drones drudging along, day after day. I know this is a very unusual opportunity to be connected to the racial unconscious and it is because I have a pretty unique viewpoint and lack of need to ascribe to the NWO spun version of things. You, for example, could NEVER make such a connection. Your limitations are huge! It would be like trying to connect a carrot to the internet; an ever so logical and 'reasonable' carrot of course, but a carrot none the less. So not going to happen. That is why YOU and a lot of other people will probably never have that opportunity.And actually, everything is opinion.. yours, mine, whoever else might have an interest in this subject.. all of it is opinion; even 'evidence' is still going to be an opinion/interpretation of some 'data', mine or yours. So to whine that all I give is opinions is like saying all I can do is breath air. Duh. All you do is breath air too. All of your accusations are just YOUR opinion of what is 'necessary', but just because YOU think it is necessary doesn't mean it is. That is just your opinion. You are of course entitled to it, even as I am entitled to mine so please stop asking for what isn't possible aka 'facts/evidence'. Tell me what information you think is necessary to validate this stuff, and I will do my best.That is part of the fallacy and manipulation of 'science'. It gives it's adherents the idea that somehow there is something that isn't somebody's opinion.. or someones opinion about somebody elses opinion, when in actuality, all 'research' really is just someone's opinion about what happened when they did a certain set of things.. and any back up 'research' is only someone else's opinion of what happened when they did them too. So although a LOT Of people may agree on the same opinion, it still isn't a 'fact'. Nope, it only an opinion. And THAT is why 'science' was invented. It is the new 'religion' for the educated.. and still firmly under the control of the NWO bunch and what THEY want you to know and believe by what they allow to be 'proven' or not.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What is so important about the ionosphere that all of the HAARP energy needs to go there?well a search of this site for ""ionosphere"" will give you some startling clues as to a battle that may be going on for control of this layer.I was watching the new Quantum Physics video ""Small Secrets""and towards the end something jumped out big time.Part 14 talks about energy (measurable voltage spikes) transmitting from the sun to our human bodies at faster than the speed of light. This is worthy of further investigation, as well as the question of ""can we talk back?""Part 16 (final part) talks about the collective human emotions on earth, and that they gather in the ionosphere.

So the ionosphere is like the collective ""emotion"" of all humans on earth? And if you wanted to block, control or manipulate this collective force, you'd need multiple weapons around the globe directing energy into the ionosphere.So China and Russia making their own HAARP-like energy weapons may be part of the plan. My theory is that these weapons aren't meant to fight each other. They are meant to work together to dominate the ionosphere and take control away from our collective conscious, and whatever we could potentially do with the 90% of our brain that we haven't figured out how to use yet.As a Scientist and Engineer I have always been skeptical about the whole ""cosmic powers"" stuff, but this video and all of the physics involved are giving me a new take on this.The more I learn about 2012, the more I am starting to realize that this is some type of evolution event for the human race, where we can start using more of our natural abilities of our mind, heart, and body, that we don't know how to use yet.

Thanks for the updated video link! Wow! I just hope people don't do any damage. You have to remember that the guy or girl in the corner store you pass is probably a relative, a mother, a father, an aunt, an uncle, etc. of someone in the crowd. I know people can get wrapped up in the moment, but restraint is the operative word, be the change you want to see. People don't have to lower themselves to the antics of the government ""enforcers,"" meaning the police and/or military. Like I said in another post the black bloc appears to be an agent of the police, as shown in the Toronto G20 report, inquiries and newspaper articles, the police masqueraded as black bloc so they could be instigate and accelerate a violent and unlawful police action.



Hope everyone stays safe!

Stop it... the kids who smash windows are fully aware of the risks and they are not stupid, even though their tactics are debatable. Come on, these are common youngsters... if one of them is found to be hurting someone for no real good reason, he's very likely to be kicked out of the crowd.

........

If you wanna look for people who pose threat to the safety of citizens, look for the cops... they're all equipped, drugged and brainwashed for this. And yeah, there are protesters who look after people who get attacked or arrested.

.......

Property destruction is NOT harming people. If society makes you into a merchandise, that doesn't mean your life isn't worth more than this. It is.

Stop what? I agree with you, a life is worth more than a TV or a car or a window, all ""things"" in a general sense. I know the cops and subsequently the military will be a problem in the Montreal protests if the government unleashes their dogs. My point is, to not give them an excuse. It's funny, when I was working with the military, violence was never the answer, it was the solution, it was brutal at times, downright rude and I have seen things done, people shouldn't see but our antagonists were well armed. I've tried to be a little more subdued in my thinking for the last 20 years, but one never forgets how to ride that ""bike.""I have been analyzing this government and a few others since 1978 and I certainly see the trends in corruption as well as moving as much, if not ALL ""value"" into very few hands, our global elite if you will, they want total control of everything. I know they have to brought down and since I have seen and understand the killing fields, I at least hope for a bloodless transition to a more equitable system of governance and ""banking."" My rational mind tells me though that this is not going to happen. People in power do not give up power willingly and will fight to the death to retain that power turning the very instruments that civilians have paid for against them. There is some irony it that simple fact.As a society we have been naive, even gullible and tempered with apathy, to busy trying to stay alive than care and make the world better, but that is part of the trap. This Montreal situation, is the beginning of what may be to come. As the spring is compressed, the limit is reached, something breaks and it expands with the maximum force available. I think this is the start of the release of that pressure and as time passes, I expect more people to ""add"" to that pressure.I've noticed people babbling about entitlement in this thread and that these are just spoiled kids in Montreal. I disagree, those ""spoiled kids"" have parents paying for their schooling or they have to take out student loans that suck the life out of them for years after they graduate. Then there is the economic problems, lies from politicians and universities/colleges alike promoting the ability to obtain jobs after these people graduate is simply BS. The corporations that own the government have outsourced to third world nations. Then the MSM carry the BS spouted by governments and universities to prop up their BIG LIE so that everyone believes it. At least until reality smacks them in the face with a 45,000 dollar bill (or more) and the promised jobs in the promised land, don't ef'ing exist.The education system appears to one of the last methods, if not the last, that will allow the corporations to suck the final few ounces of blood out of nations.If I were to state what I believed needed to be done, how it needs to be done and how I really feel, I would probably be banned.Cheers - Dave",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
307282,"At the risk of sharing too large of a quote or wall of text - here is most of Chapter 6: ""Special Effects"" from ""Revelations: Alien Contact and Human Deception"" - that deals with Rendlesham....A remarkable event took place in late December of 1980. A strangeobject was seen on the ground by a security police group at a jointRoyal Air Force/U.S. Air Force base in England called Woodbridge.The map shows the facility as an elongated zone with a twinbase a few miles away at Bentwaters. Between the two bases is a woodedarea called Rendlesham Forest.As a guard at Woodbridge Base, an American named Larry Warrensaid that he saw a UFO land in the forest. Dozens of other military menand a few civilians saw it, too. The commanding officer allegedly cameout and interacted with the three occupants of the craft. There is nodoubt, based on the documents in the affair, and on the very extensiveinvestigation conducted by Jenny Randies, Dot Street, and BrendaButler—and published in their book Sky Crash (London: Neville Spearman,1984)—that an extraordinary event did take place that night. Butfar from being an actual UFO, it may simply have marked another stepin the deception.THE RENDLESHAM CRASHIt should first be realized that the area in question has a long traditionof being associated with advanced military research. It is in that regionthat radar was first deployed in the early years of World War II. Thefacilities that can be seen above ground are said to be dwarfed by thenetwork of shelters and storage areas buried below the East Angliacountryside.The two bases belong to the British but are leased to the UnitedStates under the terms of a NATO agreement. The American 81stTactical Fighter Wing flies four squadrons of A-10 antitank aircraftfrom Bentwaters and another two from Woodbridge. The latter base,according to Jenny Randies and her co-authors, also hosts the elite 78thAerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron, specialized in the type ofemergency intervention that would be required should a team of U.S.astronauts have to make an emergency landing anywhere on the planet.At the time of the events, Wing Commander Gordon Williams wasthe Executive Officer for both bases, and Lieutenant Colonel CharlesHalt was Deputy Base Commander.Brenda Butler, an independent investigator of strange phenomenawho lives in Suffolk, first heard of the Bentwaters case through anAmerican friend who was in the Air Force. She managed to find otherwitnesses who agreed to talk to her. She quickly recognized that theexact date of the incident was a matter of some confusion. There wereconflicting rumors of helicopters and other aircraft crashing in theforest, and of weapons going wrong. Another airman who spoke toBrenda told her the base had suddenly become active late on December27; trucks had driven off in convoy toward the forest. At the time, hewas actually told by his superiors that a UFO had just crashed half amile from the end of the runway.This fact should already alert us. In actual UFO cases the attitudeof the military has always been one of denial. Only as a last resort, andafter extensive investigation, does the Air Force admit that a phenomenonmight be ""unidentified."" Here, on the contrary, the notion of acrashed UFO was actually planted in the minds of witnesses from thebeginning.A forestry worker next came forward with his story. He had foundan area where the tops of the branches were broken and the treesscorched. He reported it but there was no follow-up.A fourth man, a civilian electrician, was brought on the base to repairguiding lights on tall poles at the end of the main runway. He thoughtthey must have been destroyed by an aircraft making an emergencylanding. What seemed especially strange to him was the fact thatduring the whole time of the repairs he was surrounded by extraordinarysecurity.Taken together, these reports seemed to substantiate the actualreality of an encounter between U.S. Air Force officers and a landedUFO in an English forest.THE I N V E S T I G A T I ONThe story of the Rendlesham case, which I summarize here from thebook by Butler, Street, and Randies, developed between 1981 and 1984as the three English investigators explored new leads and obtained datafrom new witnesses. An important informant was a civilian radar operatorat Watton in Norfolk, who said that on December 27, 1980, anunusual object was tracked heading in from the coast, and it was lostnear Rendlesham Forest. Of special interest was the fact that twointelligence officers from the U.S. Air Force—presumably the nowinfamous OSI that employed Richard Doty in New Mexico—visitedthis English radar station within two days of the tracking and requestedthe recordings for study.They told the amazed radarmen that they had tracked a metallicUFO. Again, these normally tight-lipped officers were uncharacteristicallytalkative, adding that the mysterious object had been confrontedby military men whose jeep had stalled as they got close to it. They evenvolunteered that the object was observed on the ground while it wasbeing repaired by the alien crew, and that this was seen by high-rankingofficers from the nearby base, with the commanding officer himselfconversing with the occupants.Although the English investigators kept being rebuffed by the BritishMinistry of Defense—the woman in charge of answering queries aboutUFOs even denied to their face that any close encounter had ever beenreported to their office!—a breakthrough occurred when a documentthat was held back because it was covered by the Official Secrets Actin Britain was released by the U.S. Air Force on the other side of theAtlantic under the Freedom of Information Act.That key document was a memo from Lieutenant Colonel CharlesHalt. While it did not go into all the details that informants had alreadyleaked to the investigators, it did authenticate the major facts: yes,unusual lights had approached the base about 3:00 A.M. on December27, 1980. Yes, security personnel responded and found a strange glowingobject in the forest. It was metallic, triangular, with a pulsing redlight on top and blue lights at the bottom. Yes, depressions and radioactivitywere found the next day. Yes, there was a red light that seemedto throw off light particles, broke into five white objects, and disappeared.Armed with this undeniable official memo, the women returned tothe base, interviewed Halt and other officers and filled in many of thegaps in the record.One of the security people who had watched the object, the youngman designated as Art Wallace in Sky Crash, who was in fact LarryWarren, was tracked down in the United States where the Air Forcehad reassigned him after the incident. He added many details. Others,including Halt's teenage son, confirmed the exact location and theevents on the base that surrounded the landing.These disclosures failed to resolve some of the contradictions in thestory. Did the landing occur on the twenty-seventh, as initially reported,or on the thirtieth, as indicated by some witnesses? Was there anotherevent on the twenty-sixth, as some later disclosures seemed to show?Were there sightings on successive nights? And who was in charge atthe time, Lieutenant Colonel Halt or Wing Commander Gordon Williams?Finally, were actual aliens seen or only an object with somelights? Even after extensive investigation it was not possible to answerthese questions with certainty. But it was clear that a systematic attemptat cover-up had been implemented. Perhaps it is at this level thatthe Bentwaters case is most interesting—for what it teaches us aboutthe nature and the structure of such observations around military bases.DELUSION OR DECEPTION?The English investigators have presented convincing evidence that thevarious explanations offered to the public for the Bentwaters case—allegedly caused by the beam of a distant lighthouse and some brightstars—were utter rubbish. It is tempting to conclude that the militarywere indeed confronted with an alien craft and its occupants. This maywell be the solution. But there are intriguing alternatives.To me the most plausible theory is that the U.S. military has developeda device or a collection of devices that look like flying saucers, thatthey are primarily intended for psychological warfare, and that they arebeing actively tested on military personnel. Thus, the persons whocontrol the experiment can always contain the repercussions if the storyleaks out. In such cases OSI may be used both to calibrate the observers—hence the visit to the radar men and the collecting of all photographs—and to cover up the exercise itself.If the reports leak out, the cover story may be, very simply, that theobject was in fact a UFO. This is the ultimate explanation, the end ofthe road: ""What do you want us to do? This was an object we couldnot identify. You know as much about it as we do . . . ."" In other words,OSI could be actually covering up the fact that such sightings are notcases of actual UFOs! No wonder amateur ufologists are confused, asthey are confused by the observation of strange disk-shaped lights overArea 51.The mechanism of the cover-up seems to be consistent—movingextremely rapidly, the intelligence agencies sweep all the evidence and,if necessary, secure the key witnesses. If word of the event leaks out,the normal military chain of command operates to keep any controver-sial document out of public hands. If that fails, then the intelligenceagencies go into a confusion mode characterized by three simultaneousinterventions:1. They trot out their team of debunkers (astronomers, skeptics or""rationalists"") who seize upon any available explanation; the more absurdthe better.2. They ""oversell"" the UFO explanation, always emphasizing theextraterrestrial interpretation. For example, if an object has been seenon the ground, they will make sure the media give prominence to thewild-eyed witness or the local contactee cult member who will claimthat he has received a message for mankind, so that the entire affair isquickly blown out of proportion.3. They start leaking some correct information to the investigatorsbut mix it with confusing elements regarding the date, the time, andthe identity of the witnesses.All these elements are demonstrably present in the Bentwaters case,and they can be found in other military cases as well.Is there evidence that Bentwaters was in fact an instance of deceptionrather than delusion? I believe the testimony of Larry Warren isvery interesting in that regard.On a syndicated television program called Dimensions in Parapsychology,Warren recalled his experience in detail. It had been eightyears since he had served at Bentwaters. He was now engaged in mediawork, he said. A lean young fellow with long hair falling over his shirtcollar, he seemed very relaxed, his hands hooked in his belt as he spoke.He was in the security police at Bentwaters, he said. On the eveningin question he was dispatched to the motor pool to get lighting equipment.He did not know why. He obtained some ""light-alls,"" loadedthem and drove to a designated point near the forest where the vehicleswere parked. There he was ordered to leave his weapons and he walkedhalf a mile into the forest with other personnel. They halted behind asmall stone wall. From that position he could see a lot of ground fogor mist which was illuminated.There was no UFO in view anywhere, yet an elaborate scene wasbeing staged. Guards, officers, and other personnel had been assembled,unarmed in an area where some sort of fog—as in the Pontoise case—had mysteriously developed. It is difficult not to imagine that they hadbeen brought there deliberately, not to guard anything, but to witnessa very special phenomenon, and that it was their reactions to theforthcoming event that were being covertly tested.Soon there were forty people in Rendlesham Forest. They had motionpicture cameras, video cameras, and still-photography cameras.Larry Warren wondered why all that technology was being deployedjust to document the luminous fog.Over the radio he overheard someone ask, ""Why are we here?""Soon afterward a voice said, ""Here it comes!""—and a UFO arrivedfrom the north.It was only a small red light, a mile or so out toward the North Seacoast. It moved so fast that Warren had trouble tracking it, and suddenlyit was right there, hovering twenty feet or so above the ground,glowing red over the fog. Everybody stood up and looked at it.A silent, controlled explosion took place, and when it was over, thered light had been replaced by a solid object. In the process the red lightliterally blew shards of light in slow motion.The object was steady, shaped like an arrowhead with a red light ontop and a bank of blue lights at the bottom.The military units went into action. Two British policemen who hadtaken pictures had their cameras confiscated. A disaster preparednessteam announced they were getting strong radiation readings. BaseCommander Colonel Gordon Williams arrived on the scene and approachedthree life forms that had spilled out of a glowing light to theright. Were they part of an alien crew? Or were they part of a stagedexperiment?Far from being surprised by the sudden appearance of an unidentifiedobject over their base, the U.S. Air Force had clearly anticipatedand prepared this encounter. A large number of military personnel fromvarious backgrounds had been assembled to witness the event. Theirweapons had been taken away from them. They were carefully placedat prearranged locations. Illuminated ground fog and various light effectshad taken place prior to the observation of an actual object. Oncethe men had seen whatever they were supposed to see, they were pulledout and debriefed.This is not what would happen if a real UFO did land. But it isexactly the sequence of actions one would expect if the reactions of themen to a prearranged stimulus were being tested.BEYOND THE HALL OF MIRRORSTwo questions must be explored in the context of the Deception Theory.They apply equally well to Pontoise, to UMMO, and to Bentwaters.First, how could a small military intelligence unit simulate suchcomplex UFO events? And second (and most importantly), why wouldthey want to do it?The first question is surprisingly easy to answer. There would not bea single trick, but a combination of technical devices used in such asequence and in such a psychological context as to lead the observers—and if necessary, the public—to the unavoidable conclusion that a UFOhad indeed been present.Although such remotely-piloted vehicles would have been difficult toproduce in the early Fifties, and therefore cannot explain the totalityof the UFO phenomenon, they were already well-developed by the timeof the Vietnam War and easily available during the period covered inthe last three chapters. The devices in question can be equipped withmechanical, optical, and electronic devices that can be used in sequenceor in combination to produce very spectacular UFO sightings.The simplest such device is a model of a disk, two to four feet indiameter. We are not talking here about crude garbage-can coversequipped with hobby rockets, but exquisitely controlled systems carryingmicroprocessors and guided by radio. Miniature television camerasenable these gadgets to survey their surroundings and to transmit pictures.They can maneuver in and out of trees. The inventor of such adevice, who developed it for a U.S. intelligence agency in the Sixties,has told me he could make it fly around a meeting room and out of awindow. It produced no more sound than a whir.Next in the list of mechanical devices are actual flying saucers of thetype developed by Dr. Moller near Sacramento, California. These vehiclesare highly maneuverable and develop sufficient thrust to carry onepilot with his equipment. They are being manufactured to serve asreconnaissance platforms in hostile terrain. Their diameter is on theorder of eight feet. Equipped with lights, they could be indistinguishablefrom actual saucers.More ambitious UFO displays have been deployed, complete withlight projectors, lasers, and sound effects, in support of various mediaextravaganzas such as the opening of the Los Angeles Olympic Gamesor the concerts of the Electric Light Orchestra. In such cases the UFOcan be of arbitrary size and complexity since it does not have to carryits own means of propulsion. Instead, it is simply suspended from aflying crane, suitably screened from the observers by artificial fog.Some of my associates and I have thought of other ways to fly andcontrol real flying saucers which could be seen from the ground, photographed,and tracked on radar by perfectly sincere witnesses.When such mechanical devices are combined with optical and electronicdisplays, the results can be even more astonishing. Perfectioncould be reached with devices that could never be proven to be fakesby scientists on the ground. It has long been realized that all it took wasa powerful slide projector to expose unsuspecting crowds to celestialwonders, provided there was a cloud or fog bank dense enough to serveas a screen in the vicinity. Fog machines are easy to obtain from anymovie studio equipment supplier. This method has actually been usedin psychological warfare.As early as World War I the German military actually used artificialsmoke on which to project an image of the Virgin Mary, her armsoutstretched in a gesture of peace. This was projected over the trenchesin an attempt to confuse the French. (See the catalogue of SpecialEffects Services of TRI-ESS Sciences, Inc.)The problem with slide projections is that they are flat. They mayfool a casual witness, but any sophisticated observer will recognize themfor what they are. The next step is a laser show in which what isprojected is not a two-dimensional image, but an actual sculpture inmidair, like the hologram of Princess Leia in Star Wars.In all these situations it is useful to keep the observers confused bybright lights—which have the advantage of blinding those who mightbe tempted to look in the direction of the projector—as well as sounds,conflicting statements, and the suggestion that a paranormal phenomenonis in progress and that ordinary rules of logic are therefore suspended.Knowing that the technical means for simulating UFO encountersare available, the remaining question is: why would the U.S. military usethese methods?Here again we find a variety of rational and logical answers. Theyhave in common the question of personal belief of the percipient, soI will preface the explanation by posing a simple situation before thereader.Suppose you are a guard assigned to secure part of the perimeter ofa missile base. You know that an enemy might want to violate theperimeter in order to steal warheads, to procure nuclear material, toobtain secret firing codes, or simply to test the defenses.You suddenly see a helicopter flying low over the electrified fence inyour direction. It has no running lights. What do you do? Presumably,you do your duty. You raise your machine gun and you start shooting.Now let us suppose you are a devout Catholic. Drifting over thefence is not a threatening engine of war with its rotor blades, but abeautiful image of the Blessed Virgin smiling at you and throwing rosepetals to the ground. What are you going to do now? I don't know manyCatholics who would swing that machine gun and pull the trigger.Let us go one step further. Presume that the object coming over thefence is neither a recognizable threat, nor an obvious religious entity likeOur Lady, but a flying saucer surrounded with lights. Perhaps somealien creature can be seen through the glass dome. If you fire, you mightstart an interplanetary war. Most guards will hesitate before that situationand request further orders. The resulting delay, seconds or minutesof elapsed time, may be all that is necessary for the invaders to securethe base.Farfetched? Yes. But antiterrorist exercises in which the attackersdisguised their craft as a flying saucer have actually been run more thanonce, and such tests of base security probably explain a fair number ofthe UFO sightings around missile silos that are so often advanced asevidence by the amateur groups and cited by one television documentaryafter another as proof that extraterrestrials are surveying our strategicassets. In most cases the base that is under simulated attack is nevergiven the actual explanation for what happened, precisely because thetest would be worthless if the target knew about it.I have received confirmation of the existence of such maneuversfrom men who were trained in the penetration of nuclear plants andmissile bases. But other reasons exist for the use of devices disguised asflying saucers in psychological warfare. One such reason is, very simply,the calibration of the judgment of the observers. In such a situation(where a real enemy might be tempted to use such a disguise), howwould guards react? How would enlisted men, intelligence officers,pilots, policemen react? Would they still follow orders? What would thepublic think? What means could be used to increase, or dispel, theconfusion?Last, but not least, the military might even use such devices to findout if its own scientists are capable of differentiating between real andsimulated UFOs. Just in case real UFOs do exist . . .The above items all relate to tactical reasons for the simulation ofUFOs in an operational context, as may have been the case in Bentwaters.Beyond all this the upper echelon of the military in various countriesmay have a more important strategic objective. That objectivecould explain not only such local exercises as Pontoise, UMMO, andBentwaters, but also the systematic disinformation games such as Majestic12, the games of which people like agent Doty and UFO researcherBill Moore were the willing conduits, and of which men likeDr. Bennewitz, John Lear, Bill Cooper, and Bill English may have beenthe victims.Once we have entered this maze, there is no turning back. We canonly go deeper into the darkness, accumulating new data with theuneasy knowledge that much of what we find is distorted and perhapsdeliberately biased to confuse us into an irreversible belief in extraterrestrials.The only people who could clear up the confusion are the ufologiststhemselves. They are the ones with the data, who could notice andexpose the glaring discrepancies between the real UFO phenomenonand the manufactured simulations. But the community of UFO researchhas some problems of its own.COVER-UPS AND BLIND ALLEYSThe UFO shelf at your local bookstore today bends under the weightof books that claim to expose the cover-up of the phenomenon by thegovernment. And well it should. There is no question that the Air Forcehas tried to push the whole business under the rug from the beginning.It has lied, ridiculed witnesses, and even denied before Congress thatsome of the most convincing cases had been reported by its own officers.This is not just covering up—it is blatant perjury. One governmentresearch group, and possibly several, have been in operation since theFifties.In that context, anyone claiming to uncover the truth and to exposethe cover-up finds a ready audience among UFO believers and thepublic at large.But a very curious thing happens. Those who claim to bring us theseamazing revelations are generally linked to the military or to the intelligencecommunity themselves. What they are exposing is not the realsecret group, but an outer layer of outright lies and deceptions that weremeant to be exposed in the first place. Not only was John Lear a pilotfor a CIA-controlled airline, and Bill Cooper a Naval Intelligence man,but Bill English served as an information analyst at a listening postnorth of London. Bill Moore has admitted that he was an informantfor the Air Force—and possibly for other agencies as well—and hismain contact, Richard Doty, was trained in disinformation and inpsychological warfare.By what magic trick did these men manage to convince so many saneUFO researchers, including some professional scientists, that there wasa hangar full of flying saucers at Area 51 and a cave full of flesh-eatingaliens under New Mexico? One would expect ufologists to be particularlysuspicious of any unverifiable claim coming from such sources.The answer is sadly simple. Most ufologists are incredibly naive whenit comes to the methods of intelligence. Even the scientists among themhave never taken the trouble to learn the basic rules by which classifiedinformation is controlled, used, and released. And when a real exposecomes to light, they refuse to look at it, unless it happens to match theirpreconceptions.In 1979 I published such a series of exposes in Messengers of Deception. I pointed out that UFO author Major Keyhoe, who had writtensuch informative books as The UFO Conspiracy in the Fifties, andcreated the NICAP organization to expose the Silent Group and toforce the release of UFO information, was actually under the controlof a board of directors replete with psychological warfare experts linkedto the intelligence community. I asserted that other groups were undersimilar surveillance.American UFO research was not willing to listen to such simpletruth: the book was hastily rejected by the believers.It took another ten years for the assertions it contained to be vindicated.As the full text of the 1953 Air Force panel—which gatheredLouis Alvarez and other scientific luminaries—was finally understood,it became apparent that the real sponsor had been the CIA, and thatone of the secret recommendations targeted the infiltration of the UFOgroups.The deeper lesson, however, has not yet been learned.It has become a favorite game among ufologists to sue various governmentagencies under the Freedom of Information Act and to ponderthe thousands of pages released through this process.Many of the documents that have come to light in this way duringthe Eighties are papers that I remember having read in the Sixties asDr. Hynek's associate. How did they find their way into classified filesretrieved under the FOIA?The answer, once again, is strikingly simple.Twenty years ago I used to sit in Dr. Hynek's study in Evanston toread two-page telex messages sent to the Foreign Technology Divisionat Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. They would originate in suchplaces as the control tower at Okinawa Air Force Base and would bedirected to FTD and a bewildering series of other addressees thatincluded CIA, NSA, JCS (Joint Chiefs of Staff), the White House,State Department, and a dozen other places.At the very end of the dispatch would be the sighting itself: ""Mrs.Brown has reported a strange light.""I would show the piece of paper to Hynek and I would ask him,""Allen, why on earth do the White House and the NSA need to knowthat Mrs. Brown has seen a light?""He would laugh and explain to me that the Air Force could not leaveit to some low-ranking telex operator to decide who should receive aparticular piece of information. Anything that originated from thecontrol tower at Okinawa had to go to that list of addressees. Themachine was programmed that way, and it was up to the addressees todecide if they wanted to use the message, file it, or throw it away.Thirty years later some UFO group will sue the NSA under FOIAand, after much argument in court, it will uncover the amazing fact thatMrs. Brown once saw a light somewhere in Japan. By then, of course,the report will have acquired very special significance. It will glow in theaura of privileged information, extirpated from the bowels of our mostsecret agency. The sad reality is that the report, classified or not, is apiece of garbage.Although I admire the patience of researchers of UFO history whoare assembling the pieces of the official reaction to the phenomenon,I am constantly amazed at their naivete.This childish attitude reaches a peak when it comes to the belief incrashed saucers and little aliens.Most ufologists have become so frustrated after years of difficultresearch, not to mention the ridicule from friends, colleagues, andrelatives, that they have a deeply rooted need for vindication. This needis so strong as to exceed even their stated respect for the truth and thebasic standards of validation of elementary facts.Thus the claims for the existence of MJ-12 have been immediatelyaccepted by many otherwise sane researchers, and several good peopleI know have dropped everything to ponder the meaning of the anatomicaldetails in some alien pictures that were simply constructed by computerin Hollywood for the Seligman Cover-Up documentary, alsoknown as the Strawberry Ice-Cream Show.The latest revelations of Lear, Cooper, or Lear's alleged informant,Robert Lazar, about flying saucers at Area 51 have become the majortopic of debate at meetings of UFO researchers, while actual UFOsightings, which happen by the dozen every month, go on withoutanyone seriously studying them or even bothering to go look at thephysical traces!Someone is using the believers' eagerness to know the horrible truthabout UFOs. Someone has manufactured a story of little aliens, just assomeone has invented UMMO and exploited Pontoise. As we will seein the third section of this book, the process continues to work, becauseit pushes some obvious psychological buttons.Clever intelligence operations are structured with concentric layers,like an onion. The data we have already reviewed show that the top levelof the onion is designed around the official assertion that there is noUFO phenomenon at all. This is the level most skeptics and mostscientists have chosen to believe.In my opinion the evidence is very strong that a genuine UFOphenomenon exists, but serious, dedicated, and aggressive research isrequired to peel away this first layer and to find the real facts.The second layer is exemplified by MJ-12. It claims that there is alarge conspiracy to hide the information, but that the government—thewise white father in the White House—knows the truth. In his kindnesshe does not tell us, presumably because he wants to protect hischildren.I have shown that this notion was hard to believe. The UFO phenomenonis a major challenge to the entire edifice of our physics, andthere is nothing the President can do about it. There may be a lot ofburied data in Washington, there may be a large research projectsecretly trying to decipher it, but there is no secret truth! Again, datais not information. (Similarly, we have all the data in the world aboutcancer, but we still do not know precisely what mechanism causes it,or how to prevent it, in spite of the billions of dollars spent on researchover the last half century.)The third layer of the onion comes to us courtesy of Messrs. Learand Cooper. It claims that the aliens are here and they rule the world.Perhaps the third layer is ludicrous, but it works. The entire thrustof American UFO research has been destabilized by this drivel whichwould certainly not make it as science-fiction.The inescapable conclusion is that the people who claim so vocallyto expose the cover-up may be the ones who constitute the cover-upitself. Somebody is going to a lot of trouble to convince us of the realityof extraterrestrials, to the exclusion of other, possibly more importanthypotheses about UFOs.To get closer to the actual truth, as I try to do, we must patientlycontinue to peel away the deeper layers of the onion. Even if the processoccasionally brings tears to our eyes.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Actually, I think it comes down to a feeling of helplessness. The guv has us by the 'goffeys.' When it comes right down to it, what are you going to do, short of some type revolution or uprising. And on that note, I think the guv has gotten everyone much too complacent for that (or most people) not ALL.







There have been some hints that there is a child-slavery ring within CPS. I do not know how one would go about proving it, but an attorney in Austin, first brought it to the attention to some friends of mine, when their little girl was taken.



Sizzle thanks for such an eye opening thread.First I would like to ask, What really can we do about these unjust laws? You HAVE to have a social sercurity card to work just about anywhere decent. And alot of this there is really nothing we can do about it. (like when they stamped our foot print as babies.) And you cannot enroll your children in school, or take them to the doctor unless you have a social sucurity number.In respnse to you all posting important threads and getting no responses, both of the threads you were talking about I would have loved to read, there is so much information here on ATS maybe it just got overlooked. Another thing is alot of people don't want to believe certain things (like that some vaccines cause autism) , so they dont even read it because there is not much you can do about it, and ""they"" don't want to believe that they have put their children and themselves as risk.In response to sizzles post about CPS I have a story I would like to share with you all. Last year my fiance's neighbor attacked him with an ice pick and my fiance shot him at point blank range. My fiance was arrested and my fiance's 11 year old saw the whole thing. He was pretty upset, but he agreed with his dad's desicion since the guy had threatened our livelyhood more than once. I bailed my fiance out of jail the next day and he was charged with assult with a deadly weapon. (they tried to charge him with attempted murder but with my fiance being ex military my fiance bluntly told the police that he had 14 rounds left and was an expert marksman and if he had wanted him dead he would be) (The night we bailed him out we also bought him a new gun) The next week CPS showed up at our door with two cops. My fiance answered the door wearing his sidearm as he always does. My fiance told them to leave, and if they wanted to talk to him they could call and make an appointment. When they returned at their appointed time we met with them and they spoke with his son and we had gotten his son counsiling and were doing everything they said. Two weeks after the shooting the charges against my fiance were dropped. The police said it was self defense. But CPS would not leave us alone. They upgraded our file to serious or something like that and said they were going to take his son. My fiance spent hours screaming at the workers and their suppervisors. Since it was proven self defense why were they still trying to take his son? My fiance finally refuse to do anything they asked and told CPS that if they wanted to meet with any of us again they would have to get a warrent or he would take them to court. They droped the case.I hope this give some insight into CPS. If you let them take your child to begin with, there is nothing you can do. Rip up the papers, stay armed and make CPS fearful.

Hello ATS Crazy southpaw here, I have made threads/posts about my experiences with the dark terrestrials/shapeshifters and my various dreams and shamanistic experiences.I don't have dates for you guys, im just an honest individual who does not hold back. A lot of people have strange experiences. But people avoid talking about them because of their fear holds them back.I have explained several times that fear is a tool, used to supress. I also explained extensively that Good and Evil do not exist. This must be clarified in order to be enlightened, enlightenment is only awareness. If you do not deny such things and see the picture as a whole your view points and self will desolve from who you were to what you will become.Sorry for being offtopic but people need to know this. Light and dark do not define good and evil, okay? Such things are not viewing it from the skeleton but you are viewing it skin deep.There is only Justice and Injustice, Fear and love are neither good nore bad. They are simply states of being. Justice and Injustice are actions, and actions define what is * evil and good*. The world evil and good should be abolished because its obviously throwing people off from the truth of things.Fear can be good, darkness can be good. If used for Justice. But if used for Injustice. Well, you get what im saying. Same applies to love, You can argue all you want about how more powerful love is. Its just a connecting too. Love too can be bad or good. Cheating on someone would be under this catagory, All forms of betrayal which is associated with the light. See where im going with this?Its all so easily distorted. So, if i were to tell you that our saviors are dark beings. Under the current mainstream understands of *evil and good light and dark* which is portrayed in all forms of media, brain washed into everyone. This is one conspiracy people don't step on because its a *dark subject*.So assuming, If god were to show up, and be dark. Everyone assumes Demon. Then lucifer shows up bringing light, everything goes wrong. That would mean the bibles prophecy was fuffiled? right? Jesus specifically said many will preach his name and claim to be him. And they will all be lies. The christans will be lost. And we can clearly see this by the current doctrains in christianity, its all wrong.^ i don't know why, but i felt compelled to say all of that as its somewhat nessisary. I hate sounding crazy. Anyways.Prediction time.So my experience seeing the being, It personified what was to come. It revealed what it was to my friend and i first. Before it abducted a baby. Now i don't know if it really took it or not. But it appeared on the road after it dropped it off and just stared at me in its shadow wolf form. Now, i want to let people know what all that meant. Because the shadow wolf totem is a native american spirit that appears as a warning.So the fact i saw a dog after instead of a panther ( the panther reprisents mystery esoteric nature the moon enchantress and shapeshifting) was symbolic in it warning me.in my second experience with this being, i saw it a year later and called upon it with a prayer to yahweh and it appeared. I don't even know what compelled me to do that one anyways... I saw prophet yahweh on youtube and i was just kinda doing it as a joke and then the thing actually showed up 2 minutes later standing 10 feet directly in front of me, my friends were not amuzed. Lol its kinda funny i never seen 2 people get on their 2 feet that fast before. I don't even think i saw their hands touch the ground LOL.Yeah i like applying a bit of humor to this... kinda have to seeing how this is just another mind melting thread that will leave people scratching their heads or scoofing. Anyways.Various research into symbolism has aided me in deciphering many things.My wolf dream: Im not absolutely certain when i had this, maybe i was 15? I don't know. But i had it before i had my alien encounter. I was standing in the house at the front door of a place iv never seen. It was painted white and i was on a door mat. The 4 paned glass window was glazed with frost.i opened the door to see a panoramic scene. An wide open driveway covered in a couple inches of powerdery snow. There was a street light across the driveway that made it glisten. And a forest behind it. There was a road that ran left to right. but oddly in the middle of the road Directly under the street light was a big metal cage.I heard the door clank open. and a large white canine emerged from the blackness. My sight panned in close to its face and i saw celestrial blue eyes. It bared its teeth at me and made a snarl. I saw my vision pan back to where i was standing i heard it bark a few times as it dashed towards me taking 10 seconds to reach me before lunging at my face. I awoke in a cold sweat. confused because i had just gone to bed 9PM and woke up at 10 am in the morning. That was the only dream i had and i remeber it perfectly.How does this relate to my ET experience sometime later? It shapeshifted and appeared under a streetlight... so did its craft. When i have dreams that are this vivid. And experiences like this... that symbolize an event that actually happened to me later on. Then these other dreams should worry you too because i remeber them vividly as well.known timeline, only seasons are provided.1. I was in a town i have never been in. Regtanular ships were stationed in the skyies. These ships had addons which added extra cubes to them. The reason they were they was because they blew up a massive asteroid that was heading towards earth. And in seemingly protecting us, The site is viewed by all of earth as an unkown force destroying this asteroid. What the media did not portray was the ships that hovered above the cities during this time. The people on the ground were begining the believe these aliens were blowing these asteroids up. As for the ships, The whole story is blown over. But the ships remain lingering in the skies. People are seen packing and leaving the cities. -Summer timecontinued.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
328195,"Honda...are you asking do they know where the disease started on a historical timeline, or where it started in one individual? I have an answer to both, but I'm not sure what you are asking.



As far as why it's taking so long to find a cure...



HIV is not actually a ""living"" organism as you and I would define a living organism. HIV is simply a set of genetic instructions carried in a envelope to instruct its host into producing more viral particles. The problem with finding a cure is simply that most but not all viruses are extremely small, ingeniously basic, and because of this...nearly impossible to destroy.



People also need to realize that a form of HIV is found in nearly all other species on earth including Monkeys (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus), Cats (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus), Sheep (Visna), and Goats (CAEV)but to name a few. So, the virus can be traced back to an original ancestor, and that ancestor is classified in the subgroup named Lentiviruses, which are in a class known as Retroviruses. So, the basic deconstruction of HIV is as follows:



Viruses - Retroviruses - Lentiviruses - Human Immunodeficiency Virus



This particular subgroup of viruses are particularly hard to destroy (for all the reasons I have mentioned in some of my posts above but don't need to repeat again). So, we have the problem of tracing the history of the virus before the 1950's when it is believed some of the first exposures took place. We know that other species on earth have Lentiviruses themselves, but because of the mutations that take place upon entering ones body it is extremely hard to trace where exactly the virus came from.



Now, here is another piece of information to blow some people's minds...



Can two people that are HIV positive have unprotected sex with each other because they already have the virus? The answer is simply no. In some cases this can cause a supervirus (which is a whole different subject), or they can cross infect one another. So, a person with HIV can actually get HIV twice. The reason to be concerned about this is because some strains of HIV are resistent to certain medications meaning that if you are on the drug Tipranavir (for example) and you are re-infected with HIV from another person, and his/her strain of HIV is resistant to Tipranavir...then that medication will probably no longer work on you as well.



Some more food for thought...



There are two forms of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2. Not only are physicians combatting over 900 Billion strains of the virus in a single human being, but they are also battling against the two forms that HIV comes in. However, it should be noted that HIV-2 infection is rare and only accounts for a small number of infections, but when you consider everything I have previously said in my other posts you can see it will be extremely difficult for any medicine to work on it.



This is not to say that one day something won't be developed to help combat the disease better than what we have now. If you were to ask me to predict the future of medications for HIV I would simply tell you that it is more probable that medications will be developed to sustain life, and not so much to ""cure"" the disease.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Then by all means the officer was in his rights.However if I was the officer I would have waited for the scene to clear and handle it then.Let's respond.Medical or fire.

Then medics will arriveIf its a medical call.If its a fire then same for the most part police...but they park away not to hinder the access for firefighters. Then medics will park away as well allowing the fire apparatus ( fire trucks ) to have good access. Medics will standby for patients. This includes staying the whole time in case of a downed fire fighter.Now there was a case a month or so back in California. Where a cop did in fact pull a fire fighter away from a working car wreck scene. Same reason...the truck was blocking the highway. This is the one that had me STEAMING. You can find it on YT.

23061,"CNN, Washington, DC. Today, after a relaxing 4th of July weekend, President Romney held a press conference to address the issues faced by the growing numbers of unemployed. With the release of the adjusted unemployment numbers for May 2015, the official figures now stand at 12.7%.



President Romney promised that his newest round of tax cuts for people making over $1 million a year and his reducing corporate income tax to 5% will create more jobs for middle class America, and that the new rate for millionaires of 15% on earnings to replace the rate of 20% they were paying after last years cuts will definitely bring unemployment down to 6% by year end. He stressed that last summer's removal of unemployment extensions beyond six months of payments for all Americans was not causing unnecessary hardship.



In the meantime, President Romney promised the 100 million Americans without health insurance that there will be a plan ""coming soon"" to replace the Affordable Healthcare Act, but did not say exactly what that plan was. He did make a statement that ""Under the Obama Administration, the costs of providing healthcare to Americans with pre existing conditions was simply unsustainable for the insurance companies"".



President Romney also addressed last month's debt ceiling increase to $22 trillion dollars, saying that the ongoing annual spending increases for the Department of Defense were necessary for the security of the nation, and that the unfunded job creating tax cuts for the rich will continue. Americans can expect further cuts to social services, medicare, food stamps, education and essential services such as 911, to help reduce the ongoing deficit, expected to hit $2 trillion by the end of 2015.



When pressed by reporters to discuss the ongoing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico caused by relaxation of safety measures after the massive deregulation of the oil and exploration industry in 2013, Romney refused to answer any questions, simply saying that he has faith that the oil companies will make sure the spill is cleaned up from the Texas coast to Florida, as they will act responsibly and do the right thing. He declined to provide a timeline for the cleanup, or the shut down of the well that has been spilling for almost 9 months now.



While President Romney couldn't provide any timeline for the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan after last years' admission that a 2014 timeline for withdrawal was ""unattainable"", he blamed the administration of Barack Obama for setting an unrealistic timetable for this goal.



President Romney praised the recent fact finding mission to Israel by Vice President Ryan, saying that diplomatic efforts there will ensure that Iran will not actually use the nuclear weapon that was tested just last month. The President refused to discuss the ongoing bloodshed in Syria, saying simply that this was a complicated situation and that an internationally acceptable diplomatic solution would be ""coming soon"", reiterating what he has been saying since being elected in 2012, but was not willing to discuss this topic any further.



In closing, the President said that the current field of Democratic challengers for the Presidential Candidate race in 2016 was looking incredibly weak, and that as usual, none of the candidates could provide any solutions to the problems that he was fixing for America in his Presidency, and that he was confident that his ongoing ""good sense for America policies"" would win him relection.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Discovery Communications names David Zaslav CEO



Zaslav is the second high-ranking NBC executive to leave for Washington in two days, following Randy Falco on Wednesday, who will take over AOL from chief executive Jonathan F. Miller. NBC Universal said last month that it will cut 700 jobs and slash $$750 million from its budget by the end of 2008, as it trims costs to pay for expansion into digital delivery of content.

For example, prior to September 11 of this year, other then overwhelming numbers of anti-debunker and pro-commission report pieces were continuously repeated, on EVERY Discovery group channel anti-Nazi pieces were continuously shown, clearly in preparation for another Islamo-Fashist propaganda campaign.If you guys/gals this is bad, don’t even attempt to figure out what these people are programming our children with, it will freak you out and give you flashbacks.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also,, this is where I learned that Water is KING... Store up as much as you can if you don't have a good source free from the public domain. The first thing we did, while water was still ''on'' was fill the tubs and every container we had possible.



Band aids and antiseptics,,, because someone always cuts themselves the first day or so. (My present bug out bag contains three separate smaller bags with medical supplies, spare contacts, eyeglasses, and dollar store cheap drugs) You can never be too prepared here,,, and women,,, get your personal sanitary supplies stored up please,,,, this was an issue for some of the women.



Food wise,, for the first few days,,, we just camped,,, ate the food that was going to go bad first from freezer,,, drank all our beer cold,,, saved the liquor for later....lol.

Later,, we had to be more creative,, but luckily had a few great cooks who could make canned beans and other things seem like a banquet. Plan accordingly to NOT HAVING ELECTRICITY.

For some reason we had Lots of Pop TARTS,,, enough to last the whole two weeks for all who where there,,, breakfast fast in the morning while waiting on the water to boil for coffee became a ritual for us.

307751,"I'd suspect magnets in opposition could produce a type of exclusion zone that could keep particles and energy out. (If magnets can be used to contain and trap particles, then they should also be capable of the opposite.) Such a region of space might be an interesting environment for study in regards to quantum pairs that show from nothing and spontaneously annihilate. Quantum foam or some such if I recall from what bits I've read on the internet or seen discussed on TV.



I think instead of permanent magnets, some experiment(s) should be devised using electromagnets. Much more controllable (and can be rendered safe from mechanical stress by turning it off), and depending how the coils are wound and energized, you may achieve some configurations which produce field stresses not possible with permanent magnets. Some configurations could be more optimal in regards to any interaction with gravity, provided there is one. Pulsed or otherwise moving fields in balanced opposition might be an interesting research subject too.



If it is possible to produce a region of space with more ""vacuum"" than a vacuum and have access to the quantum foam, if there's any truth to some proposed quantum theories of gravity, then such experiments may yield interesting results. More might be learned about the zero point state of time-space, which might be the working ""medium"" of gravitational effects.



Yet I think anything capable of making ""interesting"" results would be expensive from an energy consumption and operation standpoint. Stuff in the realm of the typical tinkerer might not produce a change easily and readily measured. (Still couldn't hurt to try, just on the odd chance there's some physics loophole being overlooked.)



However the experiments in the video seem to fall short of what I'd consider any scientific rigor. You need to eliminate parallax, and also ensure they're very close in mass and shape because unlike the moon you're dealing with air resistance in this case. Other factors like nearby objects which could produce a braking effect on a magnet via field interactions would also have to be ruled out. Not just things the magnet would normally attract to, but also any materials which allow production of eddy currents via movement of the magnet itself. Individual drops from a mechanically consistent apparatus combined with time and other measurement references as recorded by a high speed camera would be a good start.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When someone throws a rock into the sea off coast of Spain, there is a theoretical possibility that observing the resulting disturbance on the water surface on the US East Coast, one would detect this event. But it's entirely impossible in practice. Much less to not only detect the fact that the rock was thrown, but also it's size, density and geological composition.

You try to make her sound crazy... I show you the technology is real...... and you come back with it would take to large a transmitter???Really? You think the government can't build one big enough?Or they can't isolate a signal? You really have not studied much apparently. Signals intelligence is a highly developed field. They can Isolate just about any signal... your full of poo... but here let me show you a publicly available (and this can be done as easily for EM) You can make it at home even!There are lots more ways, like lazers...Again, those are sound, but they can do it with any EM source too, but that technology is classified. But every branch of the military, and every spagetti agency has lots of people doing signals intelligence (SIGINT).Trust me I know its a lot more than voice. I will look for some non classified sources as examples.Here's one:",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

a reply to: knowledgehunter0986 I think the OP is verbose enough as it is, all you can really add to it is either back-patting or criticism. I found a few flaws in his logic (such as complaining about buzz words or phrases then using them) and decided to criticize them. If you don't like criticism then I'm wondering why you visit this site. The OP even admitted he said certain things to piss certain people off so it included political bait of the right-wing variety as well.In my opinion it's a partisan piece, why else would it be in the mud-pit? Non-partisanship isn't allowed in the mud-pit (only half-joking). This thread was just looking for a fight.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This old silver teapot has made quite a few cuppas in its time. It was a gift, a wedding gift to be exact, all the girls had chipped in of course, it was all new back then to. I used to look in this here tea pot to fix me hair, I hadn’t done that for a while. I stopped pretty’n me self up years back. I didn’t always look like I do now of course; I’m a bit tarnished and dinted just like this old tea pot. Humph and I done worked a darn lot harder too I’d recon. Where the old pots got tarnished I got wrinkles and where the old pots got dinted I got sun spots, who do I look like? I dun know really, I dun know who I take after.Mum passed when we were just tykes you see, wasn’t long after and me and me brother Billy found ourselfs dumped off at the orphanage. Dad took off pretty quick, just left us standin there, two rag bag look’n kids and one small broken brown suitcase. Not a leather one mind you, just a plain cardboard one, the old ones with the strap n buckle . I’ll never forget that suitcase! I stood there lookin down at it the whole time I was stand’n in that empty hallway not know’n what was gonna happen to us. Billy had held of me hand so tight it turned as white and bumpy as a Cauliflower, anyway never seen me dad after that.Billy tracked him down once, when he was older of course, married to Peg and had their own kiddies by then. Well anyway Billy walked through that there wooden squeaky fly wire door with his two, tan and white foxies at his heels. Snappy little things they were, never cared for them much as long as they weren’t under me feet, I wasn’t too bothered by em. He sat his backside down on that there stool and said nuth’n. I knew wat he was think’n, so I made us both a cuppa, poured it right outa this sliver pot just as I’m do’n now. I went and got some drop scones from the larder and we sat there, no one say’n nuth’n. He got up off that there stool and turned and that’s when he said he’d found dad, I just kinda stood there with a stupid look on me face. Humph, I didn’t wanna see me dad, never could care about a man who just packs his kids up and pitch’n em out the way he did, never could love a man like that.Anyway he says dad had hitched up with some sheila and had a few more kids with her, I never wasted one more thought on my dad, not in all my seventy five years since.I was sew’n hems at a haberdashery when I first laid me eyes on Roy. He come in ask’n if we sold shoe laces, he was a tall solid look’n chap, shoulders as wide as a bulls, his hair was trimmed close and he had the greyest pale blue eyes, was if a storm was swirl’n in em, even now I have to catch me breath remember’n him, takes my breath away it does, his smile was somth’n else, his top lip lifted, and as it did it showed perfect pearly white teeth, and I know I didn’t and still don’t look like someone’s who’d be know’n what pearls look like, but I did you see, as I said was sewn and pinn’n the hems of all those high stepper ’s in the city. I’d see the pearls on em they’d come in swinging in their fancy skirts and showen off their pretty broaches and hair pins. And I swear his teeth were just as shinny, I’ll tell ya if I still see a pearl today I think of his smile. He was such a sight I tell you, you know those good look’n blokes in those new snazzy under wear add s from the telly magazines, well I reckon he would beat all those blokes hands down on handsomeness.Well as you know, I wasn’t one of those ditzzy giggly girls, but that day that first time I seen him and he spoke to me about want’n shoe laces, well I went as dizzy and giggly as those girls that spend all their summer sitt’n an waste’n time at the pier. I wasn’t one to be wast’n time and I wasn’t one to be just sitt’n either.Well any way I felt me self go all dizzy just look’n up at him, I don’t know if I turned white like that time Billy squeezed me hand so tight or I was pink as the geranium in that there hang’n basket. I’ll tell you what though, you know how they say that cupid shoots arrows, I think they got it wrong, cause that day I’m sure he whacked me good n hard with a ruddy great big bat with stupid and giggly all over it. Well I eventually got him his laces, he put a penny in my hand said thank you and walked out.I looked at that penny for so long, I couldn’t dare part with it so I went out back to my purse took out another penny and put it in the register and kept his penny with me every day since. I still have it see, it’s shinier now than It was back when he first placed it in my hand. I’m always fiddl’n with it ‘n rubb’n it between me fingers it’s polished all good and round now.Anyway after a day of needles and thimbles, I was walk’n me way to the bus stop, I looked up from stare’n at that penny and almost tripped up on the curb. There he was sitt’n at the bus stop stare’n down at his new shoe laces, I’m thankful to this day there that there was no one else on that wait’n bench, cause I don’t know if me legs could of held me up much longer, they went all wobbly and I could hardly feel em.He looked at me and I couldn’t help but look back at him he showed me that perfect smile and then calmly as, he asked me if I wanted to get fish n chips and sit on the pier. Well I was all in for that wasn’t I, So we sat at the pier sharing our chips n vinegar wrapped up in the daily news paper just like you’d wrap up a baby. He talked a little about his mum and a little bit about his dad, he talked about his work as a baker from up north and that he wasn’t going to be here much longer, a few days at the most. It sadden me heart hear’n that, but I was happy to make the most of it.He come visit’n everyday day after that, and before long we found ourselves sittin on a fancier bench than the one back at the bus stop.Everything in that court house was a shiny as the sap seep’n out of a tree, and just as smooth as the golden syrup I use to make me dumplin’s. And before I knew it we was married. How a plain girl like me could find and marry good bloke like that is simply boggl’n.Well I put everything I owned in that carpet bag that I made from off cuts from the haberdashery and there I was sit’n, waiting excitedly for the train to go when all of a sudden bloody Maisy runs screaming and waving down the aisle, she caught me and bloody near strangled me with her hugs. She handed me a brown paper parcel all tied up with string, she spoke so fast and mumbled, I could hardly figure out what she was say’n.It dint take long for the conductor to shift her caboose off the train and back out onto the platform.And there I was sitt’n his hand in mine, we smiled and laughed and he pointed out all the sights along the way, at times my mind raced just as fast as the blurry cows and wheat that whizzed by.Then I remembered the brown paper package Maisy gave me, so I sat there and unwrapped it. Roy kept the string winding it up and putting it in his pocket, never know he said it might come in handy.He was good like that found a use for most things he did.Guess what was in that package, go on guess, it was this here beautiful silver tea pot, oh it was so shinny it was like a mirror one of the best gifts I ever got, this old pot has been here whenever anyone needed comfort, this old silver teapot has heard of loves and losses its been here to celebrate all the kiddies birthdays and more, oh believe me if this here silver tea pot could talk, it would have a lifetime of memories to chat about, see me and this silver tea pot aren’t much different really.The house was a nice little house on stilts. You know the sort build up high, keeps the house cool, nuth’n but dust n dirt underneath her old feet. It was just around the corner from where Roy worked as a baker I took on jobs of sew’n and mend’n , and what within twelve months of us be’n married n setl’n in, I fell pregnant with our first and there was many more to follow mind you. I always thought I’d make a pretty good mum, love the kiddies to bits and still do. Seven baby’s, twenty five grand kiddies and I lost track of how many great grand kiddies, it will come to me in a bit.Well six months after Johnny’s birth we all got news on the transistor radio from the prime minster that we was go’n to war. Roy was pretty eager to pay his part and he did just that, he paid, I paid, and everyone else bloody well paid too.He wanted to set me and Johnny up first and he had some mates back down south and their wives would’ve been alone too, what with all the blokes taken off to war and do’n there bit, so we packed up and found this house here. Too right, this is the same house, I’ve been liven here close to eighty odd years now.Well anyway Roy and a few of his mates took the day off work and caught the train to the city to enlist, while us girls stayed back here drink’n tea from this here silver tea pot and look’n after our young’uns .The follo’n week him and his mates, and some other blokes from here, caught the train back to the city where they waited to be bussed a few hours away to an army base. I kept me self busy what with Johnny and the sew’n n mend’n jobs I was get’n, I started knitt’n scarfs and jumpers for the salvo’s too by then. Anyway he sent me letters while he was there, I still have em, give me sec I’ll go get em.I can read it, I still see good enough.To my dearest Marjorie, funny read’n that. He used to say my name sounded like it came from the birds, Marjorie Florence he’d say ,then he’d give a sweet little whistle, he like to whistle, and I liked hear’n him whistle.Well anyway where was I? Oh yeah,To my dearest MarjorieI think about you and little Johnny every single day, I miss holding your hand and seeing you smile,Hopefully we won’t be here much longer, and when our leave papers come through ill be straight back home for a time, that’s if all goes well, and the fellas behave themselves and do what is expected of them.We did have one or two mishaps; it all came about due to an unhappy ending to one of the neighbouring farmers sheep. She just happened to wonder in through a fence, the sergeant is still trying to figure that one out due to him not being able to find any breaks around the perimeter.The fellas and I were a little put off with the rations that were provided to us and we were all itching for a Sunday roast. So we took it upon ourselves to solve the problem.We slaughtered the wandering sheep, well actually that is not quit correct, as we had tied her up to a nearby tree. In any case she roasted up very nicely, and we all had a jolly nice feed, we were cleaning up just as our sergeant plodded into our camp, I do believe he was sincere in our punishment and I didn’t mind doing a few extra miles up the track than usual. It did bother me however when we were asked to chip in and pay the farmer for his loss, due to the fact that we paid him a good price for a lamb when in fact, as I said previously she was a sheep. The sergeant seeing no difference between lamb and mutton stood his ground and therefore ordering us to pay highly for his lack of understanding on such a matter.Well I must get back to it, I miss you Marjorie, kiss Johnny for me and I should be home soonRoy.Well anyway Roy came home on leave for a bit and we made the most of it, picnics and walks in the park and so forth, and just about the time I fell pregnant with our second he got his orders to go off to Syria. So there I was in the city, Johnny on me hip baby in me belly and me try’n not to cry as Roy and all the blokes boarded the ship, never seen so many folk in all me life, they made it look like a big party they did. People were laugh’n n cheer’n, I dunno if I was the only one not laugh’n n cheer’n , maybe I was struggl’n too much with little Johnny on me hip wriggle’n an try’n to grab at the streamers. But I didn’t see nuthin happy about it, I remember get’n home to a dark house, putt’n Johnny in bed and just sit’n, I think I sat there and did nuf’n most of the night, I must have dozed off at some point I suppose.Things became routine soon enough, I’d put Johnny in with chooks while I hung the wash’n and dug in the garden, he couldn’t get into much trouble in there, was always on the go he was. If I didn’t keep me eye on him he’d be off down the street, a few time MrsReeve’s at the end of the block would lead him by the hand back home.Real lucky we were a pretty close bunch back then, a few times I had to call on a neighbour for help and a few times they’d call on me too. I never minded much, company was always welcome, and this here silver tea pot was sit’n here ready for anyone want’n some company.I started get’n pains while I was dig’n some carrots, kind a threw me of at first, so I got a hold of Johnny dragged him scream’n down the street all the way to Mrs. Reeve’s house hope’n she’d be able to help me out. Of course she was, she quickly took Johnny from me, gave him some biscuits and got another neighbour with a car to get me off to the hospital. In no time at all I had new baby girl, oh was she a beauty, I named her Daisy I did. Her hair was a s white as a daisy, all the kiddies were born with blonde hair, didn’t get dark till they was all in their twenty’s, dun know why but it was the same with all of em it was.About eight months after Roy left I got a telegram from him,I got shot im in hospital, all good, on crutches, love Roy.Me heart skipped a bit couldn’t stop the ruddy tears from flow’n, eventually pulled me self together and got on with it. Garden’n, knitt’n, sew’n and look’n after Johnny and Daisy. Just everyday stuff like that, on occasion one of the other wives would drop by cry’n n all, but a cupa tea would solve most of their problems.I was happy to get another telegram that Roy was come’n home for a bit, thats when he told me how he got shot. They were in a trench when a bullet ricochet’d of Dan’s helmet then go’n straight through Roys boot and kill’n a bloke lay’n behind him. Suppose you get lots of co incidences like that from war. Well he was home for a spell and once again I found me self pregnant. Roy was off again it would be last time I’d see him in five years.Some brilliant general sent him and the rest of his regiment on some beach somewhere with no ammunition, wasn’t long and they found themselves be’n taken prisoner and halled away build’n train tracks. I didn’t know this at the time mind you, all I was told is he was MIA, you know what that is don ya? Yeah that’s right missing in action. I cried me self to sleep many times in those years. Lucky I had the kiddies, some of the wives had no one but me and this here silver tea pot for comfort.Things were pretty tight back then, didn’t even have enough money to buy any wool for knitt’n had food though, I had the chooks and I was pretty good at look’n after the veggie patch. And I was a good enough cook and made preserves and pickles. And we all swapped them with each other when we could.I was happy to get another telegram say’n they found Roy, it didn’t say much other than that, still it relieved me hart to hear it.I got four more telegrams from Roy in the year’s follw’n, they didn’t say allot either, stuff like we are doing well they are feeding us well and everything is well, love Roy. I compared my telegrams to the other wives and they all said the exactly the same thing word for word, only the name was different of course. Censored one of the girls kept say’n, I didn’t care if it was censored or not, I was just happy to be read’n his name, love Roy that’s all that mattered to me. Love Roy.Did I tell ya that railway became famous n all after the war, I’m kinda proud about that many of our blokes put their guts into that railway. Anyway we heard the blokes had finaly got back into our waters and they had em on a ship just float’n around out there, wasn’t sure why they did that, figured it out once Roy got back home though, they had to fatten them up, the ship was like a big float’n hospital.It took a while for things to find a new place in our days, everyth’n change right down to when I’d do the wash’n to when I’d feed the chooks. But things was goanna be alright now I had me Roy back.As the years went on we had four more kiddies, good kids they were. It was the last baby, Betty, that had me scared, born premature you see, tiny little thing she was, didn’t have those fancy humidicribs like they have nowadays ended up put’n her the lower plate warmer of the wood stove. Roy and I’d take turns watch’n over her, he called it picket, I called it kiss n cuppa time, he’d kiss me as we passed each other in the passage and then I’d go sit in the kitchen watch’n the baby and then pour me self a cuppa from me silver tea pot. Weeks went by with us doin this; the other kiddies were good of course. Didn’t cause no problems, got themselves off to school n all, the bigger ones look’n out for the little ones.A year after Betty was born, Betty be’n our youngest, we lost Dorothy in a car accident. Dorothy was our fourth, she was out with her friends, they must have been go’n real fast to for the car to look the way it did. Toughest thing a mum has to go through I think, loos’n one of her babys.Roy passed away a few years back now and I’ve been stubl’n through the days ever since, but crikey its hard without him. Everyone else has gone to now, from the old days anyway, for some reason death keeps on miss’n me, dunno why that is, I suppose times up when times up.Oh the kiddies still visit once in awhile, normally round about Christmas time, try’n to drag me outa me house and into some nurs’n home, I won’t have it mind you.Nope, you’re the only one to come visit and keep me company, besides this here silver tea pot that is, and I thank you for that, you sit’n here list’n to an old woman ramble on about nuth’n important to anyone else but herself, I’m grateful for your visits.Time for a fresh pot of tea I think.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
219052,"While I don't pertain to the term ""super powers"" in what I study, I believe it does reach the supernatural, or paranormal level. Like stated earlier, the mind is the key to such phenomenon. However the mind is a delicate instrument to say the least, and in order to alter the physical realm even slightly, the mind must hone in on one thought, and one thought alone. To ask someone to present proof is the same phenomenon that hinders in ""normal physical"" situations. Say for instance a child DOES (I am not saying he CLAIMS to be able to) sink a hoop every time he shoots. The instant that another player enters the field and just views, the odds shift drastically. The child begins missing again and again. Why is this? Because the child's mindset has revamped entirely on that physical plane. It is my belief, from physical experience that if you maintain a mindset that is a perfect copy for every event, the outcome will not differ no matter what.



The next step comes from the release of barriers, the complete freedom of the realm. It was never the way the scene looked, it was only the way the scene was concocted. To state simply, you choose the outcome, in a serene tranquil state of mind. Reality will slowly begin to bend to your will. All knowledge, previous notions, feelings, and actions must be set free, you must freeze all instinctual behavior, such as reacting to a surprise, or trying to grab some books as they drop from your hands to the floor. Mind you, you cannot just throw a book to the floor right now and expect the same result I felt. To let it happens as it happens is in my view the greatest example of denying reality. In doing so you MAY further learn to control reality.



And on the topic of the OP more directly, did you specifically read his statements. He states he had focused intently on where he would be, probably every detail hitting right on the mark, the birds in the sky, the bugs in the grass, the other players positions. But you come here asking him to come to you, does he have any idea of who or what you look like? To ask him to teleport to area 51, while I mean no offense by it, is a rather rediculous notion. Has ANYONE here even seen area 51, up close and personal. In addition the stress that would probably arise from such a situation would be enough to keep him away from there. Area 51 is supposedly, if not some other government installation, trying to find the power of teleportation. If the OP had just waltzed right in, in the way you suggest, if he falters in the slightest, he will most likely never be heard from again, and become another one of their ""supposed"" barbaric experiments.



While I do not have written evidence on all that I have stated, it is not up to the OP to feed you information, every human supposedly has his own path and method, it is up to you alone to seek the truth. While this may contradict the very nature of learning on this subject, I can say that everytime I see a post such as this, my resolve and spirit can only be strengthened to explore more in depth into the subject.



For my own ""powers"", I have possessed some type of sonar. I merely focus on the object, visualize every aspect of the object: texture, name, meaning, etc, then I just reach out and pick the object, the feeling in finding it is purely instinctual. I have also experimented with PK in moving a psi wheel and was successful for a while, but I converted my resolve for a different type of power, apparently your reason behind gaining this knowledge selects the power you can obtain. My next one has always been with me, and it is near superhuman strength. I can't use it for sport or show, but I can bring it out while doing chores of the earth. I apparently lifted over 800 lbs off the ground, without realizing it.

Evolution Cruncher

dude either you are ignorant or you are lying. the sun is shrinking. that is a fact.



The rate of solar shrinkage suggested by Eddy and Boornazian was disputed from the outset. In the same month that Eddy and Boornazian's preliminary report was presented, S. Sofia, J. O'Keefe, J. R. Lesh and A. S. Endal published an article in Science which expressed the judgment that, on the basis of available data (mostly from meridian transit observations), the sun's angular diameter did not diminish by more than 0.5 are second 6 between 1850 and 1937.6 This value was less than one-fourth the rate proposed by Eddy and Boornazian.

Kent Hovind is a liar



The discrepancy between these results and the report by Eddy and Boornazian called for a second look at the solar meridian transit data. John H. Parkinson, Leslie V. Morrison and F. Richard Stephenson performed such a re-evaluation and concluded that the trends in the Greenwich data reported by Eddy and Boornazian ""are the result of instrumental and observational defects rather than real changes



Parkinson, for example, in a 1983 paper, states that solar eclipse and Mercury transit measurements ""confirm that there is no evidence for any secular changes in the solar diameter, with a reduced upper limit.



and so what if that is a creationists logic, if its scientific, than its scientific. debunking just because ones belief and support of that belief, should not be a determining factor.



I think that the only reason evolutionists refute limiting factors such as; the suns size and shrinkage, carbon 14 in the atmosphere and the magnetic field losing strength is because if they included those, evolution would not be true becasue without millions of years, the theory looks very stupid.



what about mokele bmembe? that is described as a dinosaur.



like I asked you before. do you know for a fact that dinosaurs went extinct 65 millions years ago, or is that what you believe



so whats your proof?





science is knowledge gained by observation, testing and demonstrating.

notice that nowhere in there was the word assumption



you believe a lot of things and its ok to believe them, but they are not science and they are not evidence for any kind of science.



the only kind of evolution we have ever observed is micro evolution



Evolution is a religion. you have to believe that it all happened, there is no way to know, no way to observe, no way to test, and no way to demonstrate



so is my theory (belief) but I admit mine is a theory.





I would have to agree that over half of the scientists believe in darwinian evolution (about 55% last time I checked



No one has ever observed this, its not testable and also not demonstrable. No one has ever seen a dog produce a non-dog and no one has ever seen a dog come from a non-dog.



many things that have to do with science have been started by christians.



star formation has never been observed.



decay will not make something better. that is like the same argument about vestigal organs. ""yeah we are losing parts, thats how we got them all"" thats not even logical.



all you need is hydrogen from a big bang, and all 92 elements can form from hydrogen by means of fusion and neutron capture and decay? id like to point out again that decay only explains how things break down. it does not explain how things formed.



I hope you understand this whole kind/species deal, most people dont get it.





note that these have never been proven, they are also taken by faith.



but have they actually tried to get a man and an ape together to produce offspring?





simon666

think Evolution Cruncher may be an Expert999 reincarnation and nominate him for banning since he starts



brianptx03

But there is a point when circumstantial evidence is overwhelming, and theories become accepted fact.

fact



Nothing can be proven or disproven because it's entirely in the human mind.



jake1997

There is two.





Faith in evolution requires belief that this system is fact, when it can be clearly seen it is not.



Please read the links I gave on that subject.here's another oneThis, in fact, is one of the ones that you cite as demonstrating that the sun is shrinking.Recall,Personal beleif has nothing to do with it from teh evolutionist-scientist's side. It isthat there is on the other side. I understand that you have faith that the bible is literally true, but even if it was, that still does not mean that the sun is shrinking nor that Kent Hovind isn't a liar.No one cares if evolution is true, by that I mean, if its true, wonderful, if its an inaccurate theory that is refuted tommrrow, wonderful.Radio-isotopic dating works.The Earth's Magnetic field cycles thru polar shifts and this results in weakening and strengthening periods.The Sun is not shrinking, certainly not at '5 feet a day' or whatever.No, mokele membe is not described as a dinosaur. What happens is that when the researchers went to the tribes that reported this monster, they showed them picture cards. One was of a sauropod. They said 'mokele membe'. Others showed them rhinos, hippo, any big animal. ""Mokele Membe, Mokele Membe!' is the response.Mokele Membe is just a monster. ALong with dragons and the rest. THey're just big monsters, you don't need to have seen dinosaurs to have stories about big scaly monsters. Besides which, from what we know about dinosaurs, theywouldn't, infact, be described in the ways that dragons and most of these monsters are described as. Dinosaurs, apparently, are extremely birdlike, and, very importantly, lots of them had, featherlike, coverings, which these dragons. Hell, lots of them had outright bird feathers.DO you know for a fact that there was an american revolution, or is that something that you beleive in? Can you demonstrate that it wasn't the invention of history teachers who needed something interesting to teach?You've been presented it a few times now. You seem to simply reject it out of hand, indeed, thats precisely what you say you do, you beleive, via faith, in a literal interpretation of the bible. Not everyone needs to have 'faith' to understand these sorts of things. Evolution is a science, just like chemistry, physics, geology, mechanics, and the rest of it. Do we have 'proof' that dinosaurs died out 65 mya? Well, hell, no more than we have proof that they existed at all, those fossils could be denied in any number of ways, and evidence can be irrationally denied.Its flat out incorrect to state that if there are any assumptions then you aren't doing science. If the assumptions are unreasonable, illogical, irrational, and clung to because of personal beleife, yeah, sure, then you're not doing science anymore. The assumptions involved in radiometric dating are quite reasonable, and there are some tests that do infact seem to show that the assumptions are accurate, like how radio-carbon dating can be confirmed by the tree ring record, or how all the methods can independantly confirm one another.[quiote]Evolution is based off of belief[...]have to believe that bacteria turned into humans ofer millions of years. and you also have to believe that animals can change from on kind to another kind of animal.Evolution is an observation of the natural world; populations evolve. The hypothesis that man is from a lineage that ultimately includes bacteria is just that, an hypothesis, and a very well supported one at that. But its not a 'fact'. It might be a fact, but we have no way to know that it is. We can only hypothesize about things like phylogeny. This is theof science. Sciencetheory. And as far as 'beleiving' that animals change into other kinds of animals, they do, and its been observed. Speciation has been oberserved. There is a barrier upon populations that holds species togther (its actually mechanisms like gene flow and the like). That barrier can be observed, hypothesized about, and overcome. There isbeyond that. There is no barrier that seperates different 'kinds' of animals, like between cats and dogs. There arespecies, and species are mutable, changable; they evolve.Simply because you ignore the evidence does not mean it will go away.This is completely incorrect, both 'macro and micro' evolution have been observed. 'macro' evolution is simply changes ""at and above"" the species level,is 'macro' evolution. Speciation has been observed in the wild and in labs. Before they were observed, lots of creationists insisted that speciation itself couldn't happen, they couldn't explain why it shouldn't happen, and the biologists could explain why, indeed, it should. Then it was observed in the wild, and that pretty much ended it. Now we often hear the same complaint, but transfered to 'kinds' of animals. Problem is, there are no kinds, and no one's been able to offer, just like with the speication issue, a reason for why change like that can't occur, and indeed, biolgists have been able to state that, indeed, it can occur.This is like saying chemistry is a religion. We can't observe the structure of the chemicals, we can only indirectly infer, thru 'beleif' and theories, that they have any particular arrangment or go thru any transitional stages.You're ideas are not theories. They do not match the criteria of a theory. A theory is not a beleif, you seem to be conflating the two things. They are strictly different. A Theory is just an hypothesis that has stood up to testing for a subjective length of time, and an hypothesis is an attempted rational explanation of patterns and things observed in the natural world that is potentially refuteable. Creationism issomething that comes up from observing nature; no bible, no creationism. And creationism isrefutable, its a faith-based beleif. No matter what evidence, divine miracles can be, and are allways, offered to 'get around' them. For example, there is not enough water on earth to cover everything. SO the miralces of magically appearing water is proffered, or if thats no good than the land is said to be completely flat, and to have magically erupted into mountains and continents after the flood, and of course another miracle is invoked to explain where the miracle water went and why it dissapeared.About Half the population of the US does/doesn't accept evolution. The vast majority of scietist accept it, and there isserious debate in the scientific community over its occurance. Amoung biologists and evolutionary theorists, there is lively debate over the specific phylogenies, and some of the mechanisms invovled, and all sorts of things, but not wether or not it occurs. Even amoung IDists, who are a tiny, unscientific, uninvolved minority within science, its accepted that man evolved from apes, and that what creationists call 'inter-kind' evolution occurs.There are no barriers that prevent it, short of the amount of time that would be invovled. And, coincientally enough, when the time barrier is removed, via the fossil record, we see transitions between types of organisms, things that are on the way to being dogs and cats, birds, and mammals. Its precisely what the theory predicts.Lets just be realistic here for a moment, because its a good point. Science is bascially a european invention. I don't think it makes too much sense to too forcfully call it a christian invention. Science really gets going during the Rennaissance and the Enlightenment. The REnnaissance is kicekd off from rediscovering classical, pagan, science texts (indeed, the pagan greeks and romansinvented science, but thats a technical subject in some ways). Christianity was around for a long, long time before christians were scientists. The Enlightenment was able to progress at the time that it did because the christian churches were, and couldn't interfere with science.It is, afterall, called the Age of Reason, not the Age of Christianity.Also, you state that most sciences were started by christians.Do you know who the people were who built up the age dating system called the 'geological column' were? Christians. Pre-Darwin, Pre-evolution, Christians. And they overwhelmingly supported the idea that the earth was millions of years old, upon looking at the evidence. They didn't let the bible cut-off their rational organs and stop their research.As an aside, there was a school of 'science' called 'Natural Theology', this was where people, usually presists in fact ( I suppose it was easy to study nature if you had that much free time and no livelyhood, mendel was a monk recall) studied nature, and tried to make nature and thelogy coincide. Thus they made detailed studies of nature, which was good, great infact, but they also attributed things like adaptation to Divine Benevolence; god made bees so that flowers could be pollinated. They missed natural selection, completely. Thankfully Darwin figured it out.Gravitons have never been observed. Hell, even protons and electrons can't be observed, we have to have machines that 'tell' us that they are there. Infact, no one has ever observed anything that occured before they were born, but I'd be a bit loopy if I insisted that Kennedy and Washington 'weren't provable'.This arguement was presented to Darwin over a hundred years ago and his book answers it. It is hardly a serious challenge to evolutionary biology.If something breaks into two different peices, and then one peice mixes with something else, have you not had creation via decay? You wouldn't call it that, not use such a strange forumulation, but that it was is happening in the formation of heavier elements from the decay of H and He.This is pretty basic.I think that you are the one who doesn't get it. Species exist. They are mutable, they have been observed to change and become new species. There is no such thing as a 'kind'. It simply does not exist. A dog is not a 'kind'. There is no 'dog-kind' out there in the world holding itself together, preventing some small and freakish population of strongly adapted 'dogs' from evolving into something 'non-doglike'. There is no cut-off to 'dogs'.Whats more, when you do try to define a set of animals (above the species level), you get some rather arbitrary traits, and you can see that there is no reason why those traits have to be fixed. One could, for example, be tempted to say that 'Bird-kind' exists, and that its defining trait is feathers. But then you find that feathers are just small little traits that are completely open to evolutionary change. And when you look at the fossil record, you see that, indeed, there are things that are clearly not birds, but that do have feathers. And things that are just like that that have less evolved feathers. And then when you look at the genetic development of birds alive today, you find that their feathers develop by having certain genes switched on in order, and that that order (if you stop at any point in the sequence), results in 'feathers' that are just like the more primitive, and less evolved, feathers in the earlier parts of the fossil record.So you again have a morphological and a genetic confirmation of this evolution, from distinctly 'not-bird', to 'definitly bird', and smooth transitions between it. The only requirement that is lacking in the modern world, so that humans can observe it, is simply. There's no limit to the changes, given time (and selective pressure of course, but all that can be observed in the modern wild world).You would have tothat evolution occurs in order to say that bacteria can't become men, basically. Given evolution, then you can have these things. We don't know what the specific phylogeny was tho. Its a theory that man ultimately descends from unicellular organisms, it can' tbe proven, it can't be said to be a fact. But at the same time, the evidence strongly supports it. If the evidence of mechanics, physyics, and chemistry strongly supports that a gun will go off and fire a bullet if I pull the trigger, I don't need to actually do it to find out that it will go off.This has never happened, no.Please drop such a pointless line of speculation. I have already given out warns today for that type of thing. Administration and Moderation, along with the Council, watches out for that sort of thing, membership doesn't need to, and certainly we don't permit members to suggest who gets banned around here. EC is participating in the discussion, I feel that he/she is ignoring some important points, but he is participating fairly. Expert999participate, that poster merely regurgitated stuff from kent hovind, of all people, and ended up having a meltdown, and even trying to 'break' back into the group. And for what, I have to wonder? To what prupose? This is a discussion group, not a soapbox, people can plainly see when somoeone is just prostelytizing and not discussing and they don't like it. Its pointless.Anyway, we'll handle any violations of the TC and such. Please don't speculate as to the membership, but rather try to address the points of other posters in a respectful and thoughtout manner.This is not correct. Theoriesbecome facts. They aretheories, they can, potentially, be refuted. A discovery might be made tommorow that shows clearly that man evolved from squirrels, not primates. Its entirely possible. I wouldn't bet on it, but science has nothing to do with what you'd bet on. But nothing is going to change thethat populations of organisms change over time. Thats why one hears about the ""fact"" of evolution and also the ""theory"" of evolution. They are twothings. The Fact is, evolution occurs, populations change, we can observe this. The Theory is that this occurs thru a mechanism of natural selection and that it leads to speciation and adaptation. Thatbe completely wrong. Its potentially falsifiable, and we can test for that theory and attempt to refute it.Thats what scientists do, they try to refute scientific hypotheses; theytry to prove them. Theybe proven.If you think about it, everything occurs within the human mind. All sensations, all understanding of the 'natural world', are gathered thru the sense organs, translated into electrical-nervous impulses, and then processed in the brain (and spine, considering reflexes). Everything you 'know' is a construct of your brain, whether its religion or science.One of the bigis what you can do about it. You can have faith in allah, reincarnation, Jesus as Saviour, the cult of ancestors, or anything, and it makes a difference for you personally. But no matter who you pray to, if a fucntional nuclear bomb is set off, everyone gets vapourized, irrespective of beleifs about Atomic Theory.Assumptions?

Please explain what evidence indicates that they are poor assumptions, and please explain why, hypothetically assuming that they are poor assumptions, these Isochron methods independantly confirm and jive with all the other dating methods??

36194,"Talk.Origins:Deception by OmissionJorge A. Fernandez© 2002 by Jorge A. Fernandez. All Rights Reserved.INTRODUCTIONhe Talk.Origins (TO) website ( www.Talk.Origins.org... ) is promoted, among other things, as an educational site, a place for obtaining information on evolution and answers to the numerous criticisms to this theory. Although TO states that it is a “forum for discussion”—presumably unbiased—much evidence testifies to the contrary. I’ve been observing the TO site from the sidelines for quite some time and have until now restrained myself from responding to the materialistic worldview that this organization pushes on the unsuspecting. It is particularly distressing to me to read the feedback letters from young people and watching those impressionable minds being manipulated through TO indoctrination.To be fair, and to emphasize that this is not a witch-hunt, I must say that some of the volunteers at TO undoubtedly have good intentions and are sincere in their efforts. However, in this particular arena good intentions and sincerity are not enough (I’ll return to this point at the end of the article). The full, unbiased disclosure of truth is what is essential here and TO doesn’t even come close to providing it. In any event, this article is my first, albeit brief, critique of the Talk.Origins site and I herein intend to expose some of what TO doesn’t tell its readers.I should begin by saying that almost immediately after deciding to write these words I was overcome with a sense of awe at the magnitude of the task—let me explain:Talk.Origins is very hard to target—a fact that may be so by design. For example, if a person disagrees with TO on the ‘fact of evolution’, these people will employ a definition of evolution [“Biological evolution is a change in the genetic characteristics of a population over time”] that makes it impossible to disagree and, if one does argue, then that person comes across as being uninformed or irrational or fanatical. This might be acceptable if only it remained right there.But it doesn’t! That statement about evolution (which happens to be accurate, i.e., genetic characteristics of populations do vary over time) is subsequently modified / extended throughout TO’s many articles and feedback responses so that not only is the person to accept the (empirically corroborated) fact of change, but also that this change is the sole causing agent for the diversity and complexity within an organism (internal organs, cellular structures, etc.) as well as outside of the organism including Earth’s entire flora and fauna. The metaphysical extrapolation of the data that is required to accomplish this feat is somehow missed by TO—either by ignorance or by design. What’s more, if we are to remain exclusively within the natural (material) realm then the term ‘evolution’ must somehow be further extended to include life from non-life, i.e., the emergence of life itself must also be accounted for by the ever-stretching definition of evolution.There’s more. The origin of the basic materials that make up all objects (living or not) must also somehow be accounted for so yet other forms of evolution enter the scene—chemical, stellar and planetary. In fact, the universe itself must also be accounted for by evolution. Thus, whether they hypothesize a Big Bang, a quantum fluctuation, aliens from another dimension or some other natural explanation, the universe began and has ‘evolved’ to what it is today.Few would argue with the notion that ‘things change.’ But to take the step from ‘things change’ to ‘and therefore, that’s how it all got here’ is a leap of blind, irrational faith that would send even the most fanatical snake worshipper reeling.The bottom line to all this is that the fundamental concept of evolution is clearly a manifestation of a metaphysical—not a scientific—worldview and, just as with any other religion, the facts must continually be interpreted and adjusted to fit with this belief.Essentially then, TO is a propaganda machine for philosophical naturalism using the more acceptable and palatable cover of methodological naturalism. Evolution theory is nothing but the scientific operational model to support this metaphysical position.TO attempts to cover this point by stating that in their group they also have Christian and other religious evolutionists—people that believe in God, believe in a creation by a deity, but also believe in evolution (i.e., middle-grounders). TO employs this strategy to give its visitors a sense of universal appeal, i.e. that anyone, regardless of their beliefs, may subscribe to evolution. But again, exactly what evolution are they referring to? The one that says “things change” (this is science), or the one that says “that’s how everything came to be” (this transcends science and is philosophical naturalism—a metaphysical position)? TO uses the two interchangeably.Yet, anyone who knows the score realizes that middle-grounders are at best marginally tolerated by ‘pure-blood’ naturalists—as these say, “the hypothesis of God is unnecessary!” Why, then, do the pure-bloods tolerate these naturalistic ‘misfits’? There are probably many answers to this question but two are worth briefly mentioning: ‘divide and conquer’ and ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend.’ Thus, naturalists welcome whatever sows dissension among creationists and, therefore, anyone disagreeing with the fundamentalist Christian position in any way while accepting any part of the evolutionary doctrine is embraced by them (at least for now).The focus of this article is on those deceptions invoked by the TO writers, which are mostly achieved by omissions, as is demonstrated in the illustrations below. It is often what the people at TO do not say that makes TO a propaganda/indoctrination site as opposed to an educational site.The Talk.Origins FAQ page ( www.Talk.Origins.org... ) gives readers a shortened version of TO’s position. On February 13, 2002 this site had 24 questions, with brief answers and links to “relevant files.” My responses (R) to selected entries (Qs & As) taken verbatim from the TO FAQ page, reveal how the TO writers have selectively omitted essential facts in their efforts in order to lend credibility to the TO perspective:JUST A THEORY?Q: “I thought evolution was just a theory. Why do you call it a fact?”A: “Biological evolution is a change in the genetic characteristics of a population over time. That this happens is a fact. Biological evolution also refers to the common descent of living organisms from shared ancestors. The evidence for historical evolution—genetic, fossil, anatomical, etc.—is so overwhelming that it is also considered a fact. The theory of evolution describes the mechanisms that cause evolution. So evolution is both a fact and a theory.”R: Clearly there would not be a creation-evolution controversy if it were universally agreed and adhered to that evolution meant solely “a change in the genetic characteristics of a population over time.” There is a creation-evolution controversy (a major one at that) precisely because evolution means far more than what TO leads its readers to believe here. The controversy exists because evolution—the full-fledged manifestation of evolution (including Neo-Darwinian macro-evolution)—is for many a metaphysical belief that elevates the philosophy of materialistic naturalism (hailing purely natural laws and processes, including time and chance, as our “creators”), and dismissing God (a Creator with purpose) as an irrelevant product of superstition.After all, why is it that so many people are offended by the theory of evolution to the point of fiercely opposing it? Why is it that emotions run so high and intellectual battles persist? Because of ignorance? Hardly! Although there will always be uninformed people on both sides of any dispute, a great many well-educated people in science, mathematics and other disciplines are among those who disagree adamantly with the precepts of evolution. Evolution is offensive because it is bad science and is as equally bad a metaphysic—in short, on close examination, evolution fails on all counts. There is a controversy precisely because of clashing metaphysics—the same type of conflict that exists when Christian theology comes face-to-face with Islam, Buddhism, or even atheism, to name just a few popular counter-Christian belief systems.Despite all of this, TO promotes the view that the creation-evolution controversy is a war of ‘religion versus science’—‘emotion versus reason.’ This view is held mostly out of ignorance, but there are undoubtedly those within the TO organization that understand the matter well enough to know better. However, TO does very little to educate its audience on the philosophical foundation of its position. This is deception by omission.WHO ACCEPTS EVOLUTION?Q: “Don’t you have to be an atheist to accept evolution?”A: “No. Many people of Christian and other faiths accept evolution as the scientific explanation for biodiversity.”R: Two points here. First, TO wants to assure its visitors that “Christian and other faiths” are compatible with evolution. I would again say that all beliefs are compatible with evolution as long as evolution is confined to speaking about (observed) biological change. But as we all know (or should know), this is not the way that it is.Evolution, as a manifestation of methodological naturalism (the operational version of philosophical naturalism), makes countless assertions into metaphysical areas with cosmological and biological origins representing just a few of these. TO makes no attempt to make known this subtle yet all-important aspect of what ‘accepting evolution’ comprehensively means. TO lures ‘people of all faiths’ into their camp with assurances of compatibility. Deception by omission.The second point concerns the latter half of their answer: “...evolution as the scientific explanation for biodiversity.” Such a statement suggests the necessity of concessions, compromises, and ‘special’ interpretations of the Bible in order to satisfy the (naturalistic) theory of evolution as the explanation for biodiversity. After all, not doing so entails opposing the formidable and authoritative pronouncements of the “scientific establishment”—and who wants to do that? [Besides, exactly how would the average person go about challenging this “scientific establishment”?]I ask, whatever happened to the answer that, “Biodiversity is part of God’s creation”? Specifically, if a person believes in God as the Creator of everything then this ‘everything’ includes the biodiversity that we observe. Of course, maybe in this arena ‘everything’ does not mean everything? Nowhere does the Bible even hint that a gelatinous substance was formed and that from this goo there emerged ‘simple life’ that diversified—over eons—into zebras, humans, and the rest of the biological community.Quite to the contrary, concerning man’s origin, the Bible very clearly states that ‘from the beginning of creation, God made them male and female’ (Genesis 1:27; Mark 10:6). It bears pointing out that this foundational event in the biblical record defies any kind of evolutionary ‘interpretation’ that doesn’t compromise either evolutionary dogma, the credibility of the biblical record, or both. The Bible contains numerous other assertions that cannot be reasonably answered under the paradigm of evolution unless the Bible receives ‘special’ interpretation—the kind that denigrates the historical validity of the biblical record in order to accommodate popular contemporary beliefs. This then is the bottom line: the Bible has to be distorted in order to accommodate the edicts of evolution. TO never mentions any of this, preferring instead to shamelessly assert that evolution and Christianity are somehow ‘compatible.’Besides, “...evolution as the scientific explanation for biodiversity” is nothing more than a tautology in the sense that it is the “scientific community” that dictates what is admissible and what is not. Is it any surprise that this same community embraces philosophical/methodological naturalism and frowns heavily upon anything that even remotely suggests anything other than material causes?I can think of no better illustration of this than the case of intelligent design theory (ID). Leaving out numerous details, ID is having a difficult time being accepted into the scientific establishment as a bona fide scientific theory simply because it has metaphysical—in fact theistic—implications. After all, if the logical conclusion is that specified and complex design is present, then a designer is the only available option and the big ‘G’ immediately enters the realm of possibilities. Naturalists were quick to pick up on this rather obvious and, to them, highly unpalatable conclusion and as a result ID is being treated by many as if it were advocating the practice of human sacrifices.The fact of the matter is that ID is as robust a scientific theory as one should reasonably expect, having all of the components—foundation, logical/mathematical formulation, explanatory/predictive power, etc.—that other widely accepted scientific theories have. For more details on this I recommend two sources: The Design Inference, Cambridge University Press, 1998 by William Dembski and Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science and Theology, InterVarsity Press, 1999 also by William Dembski.To summarize this point, ID is not being scorned because it is bad science or illogical, but because it crosses the line that separates one metaphysical worldview from another. The “people in charge”, i.e., the naturalistic scientific establishment, are unwilling to allow that to happen—naturalism must be protected at all costs, from their point of view. Why doesn’t TO mention or elaborate on any of this to its readers? Deception by omission.AN UNFALSIFIABLE TAUTOLOGY?Q: “Isn’t evolution just an unfalsifiable tautology?”A: “No. Evolutionary theory is in exactly the same condition as any other valid scientific theory, and many criticisms of it that rely on philosophy are misguided.”R: Evolution is largely an operational manifestation of a philosophically naturalistic foundation—to deny this is to be either uninformed or deceiving. There simply cannot be an area of scientific inquiry without some philosophical foundation for the obvious fact that science is conducted exclusively by humans (no aliens, please!) and all humans—whether they acknowledge it or not—subscribe to some philosophy regarding their internal being (consciousness) and their external world (the universe). For TO to state that philosophical criticisms are misguided is an act of willful ignorance at best and unmitigated deceit at worst.As far as the ability to ‘falsify’ evolution consider the following:Nobel laureate Dr. Francis Crick promotes ‘directed panspermia’ (i.e., ‘DNA originated somewhere ‘out in space’ and somehow made its way to Earth’), apparently having recognized the odds against a natural earthly cause for DNA.[1]Richard Dawkins (The Blind Watchmaker, W. W. Norton, New York, 1986) assumes the number (1020 by his accounting) of theoretically possible planets that may exist in the universe in order to provide sufficient opportunities for the highly improbable event of life to occur naturally (i.e., without intelligent direction).Barrow and Tipler (The Anthropic Cosmological Principle, Oxford University Press, 1986) go far beyond Dawkins in that they invoke entire universes (theoretical, of course) as the potential arenas for (natural) life to emerge.Kauffman (The Origins of Order: Self-Organization and Selection in Evolution, Oxford, 1993) takes a different route than Dawkins, Barrow and Tipler. Kauffman brings into the panorama a hypothetical set of laws by which life may emerge here on Earth solely through (only) natural process.Now, some may choose to argue that these distinguished gentlemen are simply doing ‘science’—proposing theories to explain observations, among other things. However...The term to remember here was ‘falsifiable’—and, to take just one example, we might ask ourselves how one goes about falsifying an infinite number of universes.Here’s the point to all of this:If we are allowed to propose essentially anything (aliens, parallel universes, 1020 planets, extra dimensions, time travel, etc., etc.) in order to uphold our theory then how will it ever be possible for that theory to be truly falsifiable? As clever and imaginative as we humans are, wouldn’t we be able to—don’t we—contrive just about anything that would allow us to retain the position or theory that we cherish?Well, not always. All human cleverness and imagination could not save the phlogiston theory, the notion of blood humors, the geocentric model, and many other now defunct ideas. There is, however, one major difference where evolution is concerned—a difference that makes evolution impervious to that which toppled these aforementioned and now extinct ideas. That difference is the intimate and critical connection between evolution and philosophical naturalism—a metaphysical (i.e., religious) connection.As the universally recognized and accepted authority on what is admissible as ‘scientifically valid’, the scientific establishment (anchored in naturalism) has constructed the rules so that evolution is the de facto answer. This matter may be expanded in many directions so I’ll end on this note: eliminate evolution and what are the remaining options? Naturalists know well that to eliminate evolution is to eliminate the single possibility for a natural explanation of the origin of life and of biodiversity. Therefore, evolution must be sustained even if this requires hypothesizing the preposterous or the unfalsifiable. The only other alternative, the supernatural, is simply not admissible.One further example of this, not listed above, of how the establishment is committed to defending its position at all costs is the case regarding transitional fossils. The transitional fossil evidence is highly suspect and a great deal of controversy exists within and outside of scientific circles—certainly not what the evolution advocates (particularly Darwin himself) ever expected.So what do the evolution advocates do? Is the validity of the theory even questioned? Never! Instead, ingenious mechanisms such as Goldschmidt’s ‘hopeful monsters’, the ‘emication’ idea of the Swedish botanist and geneticist Nils Heribert-Nilsson and the more palatable ‘punctuated equilibria’ of Gould and Eldredge were proposed—whatever it takes to lend credibility to a theory weakened by the empirical data. There is a fine line between scientific ‘ingenious mechanisms’ and metaphysical ‘sorcerer concoctions’ and it is a historical fact that even reputable men of science have crossed this line many times in order to support a paradigm. So once again I must point out that if naturalists essentially have a carte blanche in what they may propose to uphold their pet theory, in this case evolution, then it will be extremely difficult if not impossible for someone to falsify their position. Why doesn’t TO expound on this fact? Deception by omission.HOW DO YOU KNOW IT’S TRUE?Q: “No one has ever directly observed evolution happening, so how do you know it’s true?”A: “Evolution has been observed, both directly and indirectly. It is true.”R: Need I repeat it? Yes, if evolution is confined to saying that, “biological evolution is a change in the genetic characteristics of a population over time” then TO’s conclusion of “it is true” is an accurate statement. However, it’s what TO doesn’t say that makes their answer deceiving, and this continuous deception makes TO an indoctrination site for advancing philosophical naturalism—buyers beware!For the record, every informed creationist that I know of accepts changes, mutations, adaptations and even speciation—there is no dispute here. The real dispute is in the naturalists’ extrapolation from (observable) genetic ‘change’ to (unobservable) Neo-Darwinian macro-evolution to (unobservable) ‘cause for being’. Such an extension is no longer science, it is a metaphysical transfiguration. TO does not inform its readers of this, since to do so weakens the case for their apparent true objective: Deception by omission.NEW SPECIES—THE REAL ISSUEQ: “Then why has no one ever seen a new species occur?”A: “Speciation has been observed, both in the laboratory and in nature.”R: This is absolutely true [speciation as science defines it has been observed] but, as I have stated already, there is no dispute here. However, TO does not get to the core of the matter and leads its readers to the notion that the origins controversy is one of science versus religion—that creationists deny the fact of speciation and are thus “ignorant”. Why don’t they mention the critical point, namely that creationists do accept speciation—but the dispute is about the causing agent of speciation, biodiversity and, ultimately, biological origins? Why do they make false accusations against creationists, instead of facing the empirical roadblock to the arbitrary extrapolation of Neo-Darwinian macro-evolution from the variations observed in speciation? Deception by omission.2nd LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS—THE REAL ISSUEQ: “Doesn’t evolution violate the second law of thermodynamics? After all, order cannot come from disorder.”A: “Evolution does not violate the second law of thermodynamics. Order emerges from disorder all the time. Snowflakes form, trees grow, and embryos develop, etc.”R: TO is here propagating one of the most odious of all myths in the creation-evolution controversy, this being that the creationist argument involving the second law of thermodynamics is either invalid or has been amply refuted. This is simply not true.The essential information that TO is either ignorant of (or is concealing from its readers) is that when snowflakes form they do so according to thermodynamic principles that produce patterns (i.e., symmetric crystalline structures) that are far from the asymmetric, far more complex structures required for life. What’s more, symmetric structures occur naturally because thermodynamic equilibrium is a natural state. On the other hand, life—any life—is actually a departure from thermodynamic equilibrium; a significant departure that requires large amounts of directed energy to be sustained, according to requirements defined in advance by every organism’s genetic code.Similarly, the example of “trees grow and embryos develop” is again an oversimplification based on either ignorance on the part of TO, or a willful concealing of the whole truth from their readers. The point is not that organisms grow but how they are able to grow. The typical, shortsighted response is that “they are receiving energy from the sun—it is an open system and this energy provides the fuel for growth”. Recently, Harvard’s own Ernst Mayr served up precisely this “open system” explanation in his latest book, What Evolution Is [Basic Books, 2001, page 8]. True, energy is being supplied but the main point is being missed (intentionally?).Let’s take a blow torch to a tree or an embryo, thereby supplying it with plenty of energy, and then let’s stand back and watch them grow. Of course, what’ll happen is they will be incinerated! Energy is not the key; energy reception, utilization and storage is the key. In other words, there must be a highly sophisticated and fully functional energy management system—a system that enables input, conversion, storage and output—if a tree is to grow or an embryo is to develop. This is the crux of the creationist argument involving the second law of thermodynamics and not some easily discarded strawman. Why doesn’t TO present the real issue and respond to it? Deception by omission.THE NON-EXISTENT ‘PRIMITIVE’Q: “The odds against a simple cell coming into being without divine intervention are staggering.”A: “And irrelevant. Scientists don’t claim that cells came into being through random processes. They are thought to have evolved from primitive precursors.”R: Let’s just focus on the ending words of their answer, “...from primitive precursors”. Evolution advocates have always believed that it was possible for nature to begin with “simple, primitive life” and evolve over eons towards ever-increasing complexity. This is, after all, a major postulate of evolution. There’s just one problem with this hypothesis and it’s a whopper of a problem!As science and technology advance, what we are finding is that the notion of “simple, primitive life” is receding at an ever-quickening pace. It is now clear that the idea of a ‘simple gelatinous goo’ actually necessitates a level of complexity that cannot be explained naturally even letting the imagination run rampant. Likewise, the ‘simple’ cell has been found to be anything but ‘simple’. In fact, the cell is now understood to be of a complexity that eludes all scientific attempts to quantify it and the more we study it the more complexities are being unveiled.These are just a few of the reasons why those that want to uphold evolution while retaining naturalism (their metaphysical position) have come up with aliens or with hypothetical natural mechanisms of self-organization or with other contrivances—it’s the only way to explain these vast directed complexities while keeping the big ‘G’ out!Thus, when TO uses the words “...from primitive precursors,” why don’t they mention to their readers the fact that the concept of a primitive organism is a philosophical ideal for which there is not a single shred of empirical scientific evidence? Why don’t they mention that current scientific evidence leads to but one reasonable conclusion, namely, that the simplest conceivable organism must be anything but simple or primitive if it is to be capable of carrying out any of life’s functions. Is TO ignorant of these facts? I don’t believe they are. Deception by omission.SIGNIFICANCE & RESPONSIBILITYAt the beginning of this article I had stated that “the full, unbiased disclosure of truth is what is essential here and TO is not even close to providing this”. Aside from the obvious fact that complete, unbiased information is always better than partial or distorted information, it is infinitely more so in this arena than in any other. Why?Well, it’s because of the stakes. Clearly the majority of TO supporters belong to the atheist/agnostic/naturalist camp. Hence, to them there is no afterlife (certainly not one in the Christian sense) nor is there a personal God; a judgment by Jesus Christ; accountability to a Creator; heaven or hell. This belief is their choice and no one is denying their right to this choice. However...To those that visit the TO site in search of answers—people that may be undecided and seeking unbiased information—to these people TO owes the courtesy of behaving in an informative capacity and not as an indoctrination site.But it goes far beyond being just courteous or professional. It is morally irresponsible to misguide people through omission into any position that has eternal consequences—yes, eternal consequences. That last statement may sound religiously biased but is actually a logical result since, regardless of who is right or wrong in this matter, the ultimate end is of eternal consequences (whether an eternity in the grave, or an eternity in heaven or hell).This, then, is my strongest criticism of TO. If TO is going to educate, then educate they should! To educate means to present all sides in truth and completeness and accuracy. Education is the antithesis of indoctrination. In this article I have presented but a small sample of the many cases where TO is guilty of being nowhere near complete, accurate or truthful. In some cases this may have been through their ignorance, and in other cases through deliberate intent—I’ll not pretend to know which of the two is the case.One thing is clear, if intellectual integrity and ethics mean anything to the TO staff, then after this article I would expect to see one of two things—ideally it would be both:A clearly stated disclaimer at their website indicating that their goal is about promoting the theory of evolution—to the point of demanding ‘special’ interpretations of the Bible—and, more generally, about promoting a naturalistic, materialistic view of the universe (a la Carl Sagan).A truthful, accurate and complete presentation of views other than evolution or naturalism (e.g., intelligent design theory) alongside their own preferred views. If they are unclear as to what these other views are, then they should conduct a serious, scholarly inquiry and not simply post some incomplete or distorted version of what they believe the other side has to say on the matter.I cannot see how Talk.Origins will be able to acquire a status of objectivity and truthfulness without adding at least one of these attributes to their site. As it stands, Talk.Origins is an affront to the ideal of intellectual integrity, scholarly pursuit and moral responsibility.Jorge FernandezMarch, 2002Reference[1] Crick, Francis, Life Itself: Its Origin and Nature (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1981) 192 pp.pp. 51-52:“If a particular amino acid sequence was selected by chance, how rare an event would this be?“This is an easy exercise in combinatorials.

Well If you feel empty at this moment, then what you feel now is that you drained down your energy and have gotten

to a certain moment in life where you have a certain insightfull perspective on what life is all about from your point of view. You may have expected high standards or you feel dissapointed in people for not living to your high standards and that what makes you feel down and empty.



To best thing to do is have a conversation with yourself about who you are, where you came from, how you feel, and where you want to go, and what you want to feel and build towards that what you actually want to feel.



life is about experiences. You can make plans and goals to reach, but the bottom line is make sure that everything you do is doing it because you love to do it.



When empty you can refill yourself with a new beginning with a new kind of perspective on life.

for instance:



In the beginning: Millions of seeds swimming around some balls having conversations about life in the sack. One seed to another:

Hi there, hey have you heard the story ? No what asks the other? Well it seems we are all living in a man and when he does not

find some love we will mostly splatter on the ground and die not able to ever know what love really is.



Ooh that sucks says the seed. Yeah not only that, if you are really unlucky, you just land in sh!t. That's no place any seed likes

to go, would you like sh!t all over your tail and head ? No i dont think so. Screw that says the seed, well lets just pray the man

finds the right spot to screw, else we probably will be getting screwed all over the place.

I dread to think what's inside those flu vaccinations to shorten the life span. Sounds like paranoia doesn't it from my part, but I've researched a plenty into the medical service hence why I wrote a lot on the first page. So I'm pretty sure these 'free flu vaccines' aren't all they are cracked up to be.

Well, besides live attenuated viruses or deactivated viruses most vaccines including those for Influenza species and sub-species like H5N1, H7N3, H3N2, Influenza A, Influenza B, etc. do contain other chemicals mainly used as preservatives. Because Influenza is an RNA based virus found in the Orthomyxoviridae family it has a very high rate of replication and mutation as with most found in this family, which can cause various serotypes to occur based on the order of its viral proteins Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase. In fact, this process is so efficient that DNA polymerase enzymes that are dependant on RNA transcriptase make errors in about every new replication process allowing every budding viral particle to be distinctly different both morphologically and genetically than its ancestor. Most Influenza vaccines contain the inactivated form of the virus, which are disrupted with zonal centrifugation, multiple purification, and finally inactivated by sodium deoxycholate and formaldehyde which results in a viral split. With the vaccine “Fluarix” in particular, each inactivated virus is then suspended in a solution of sodium phosphate and sodium chloride to further dilute the mixture.One reason that Influenza vaccines contain higher concentrations of preservative chemicals than other vaccines is because typically the high rate of viral mutation leads to impurities in the vaccine manufacturing process. Off the top of my head without having to look through every single one of my medical journals I can think of a few chemicals used in the manufacturing process of Influenza vaccines such as Fluarix and Fluvirin (the most common ones):-Gentamicin Sulfate- an aminoglycoside antibiotic used to prevent gram-negative bacterial growth-Formaldehyde-Neomycin- an aminoglycoside antibiotic used to prevent gram-negatives and gram-positives from reproducing-Polymyxin-detergent antibiotic used in vaccines as an anti-fungal agent-Thimerosal- made from Ethylmercury (different than the toxic Methylmercury) which cannot bioaccumulate (I have covered this in other threads previously).-Polysorbate- an emulsifier-Tributylphosphate- used as a solvent, and only in the manufacturing process-Betapropiolactone- a sterilizer and disinfectant which is hydrolyzed, metabolized, and excreted at a fast rate.-Etc.None of these chemicals are especially toxic in the doses given for typical Influenza vaccines. Tributylphosphate does have some inflammatory issues in large amounts, but because it is only used as a solvent in the manufacturing process and not usually contained in the vaccine itself, there is little risk of a toxic effect. Thimerosal has been discussed in great length on ATS previously (quite a bit myself), and I will stand by the fact that Ethylmercury is an entirely different form of mercury than its toxic methylmercury cousin. Not only this, but Thimerosal is found in virtually non-existant amounts in Influenza vaccines as compared to the MMR vaccines, which tend to stimulate a lot of controversy these days.It is very difficult to “cure” viral infections with any other means than vaccines or some newly established Bacteriophage therapy because of the high rates of mutations caused in the genome of RNA viruses. On the other hand, DNA based viruses have much less efficient biological processes and are usually not terminal threats. Not only this, but because viruses are not essentially living organisms by definition it becomes extremely difficult to eradicate infections completely using “natural” remedies (the efficacy of which have never shown positive results), and we are forced to turn attention to synthetically manufactured vaccines and variants. It is not that the medical community wishes to prolong illness of any sort, but that with limited means of defense we are forced to use other means of combatants.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The basis for this project is control of communications, both disruption and reliability in hostile environments. The control of such instruments is obviously a concentration of power.The ability of the HAARP, the space and rocket combination to send an extremely large amount of energy comparable to a nuclear bomb, anywhere on earth via laser and particle beams, are frightening.

Is that okay with you? Apparently not. You surely are free with your accusations of illogic, but I see absolutely nothing you have said or done that refutes the basic issues here. And from your writing I would say you are unfamiliar with the principles of logic. You have no idea what you are talking about and your accusing other people of being illogical is empty rhetoric with no foundation whatsoever. At best, it is the pot calling the kettle black.The ONLY thing you have done is question the existence of the Insider (something I share, actually). You have indulged yourself in character assassination of Ulsterman in a lame attempt to cast doubt on the revelations provided by Ulsterman/Insider. Just like the Democrrats in this last election, NOT ONE ran on the issues. NOT ONE said, ""Vote for me because I voted for Obamacare, Cap & Trade, and the bailouts."" They ALL chose to cast aspersions on the person they were running against.That's what you've done here. That's the point of your entire thread, that Ulsterman/Insider are not credible, THEREFORE none of these allegations are supported. Why is U/I not credible? Because you haven't heard of them before. Your basic complaint is that he is not a professional journalist--at least, as far as you know. What that means is that U/I has not undergone the rigors of a liberal Communications Department propaganda machine in a typical Liberal Arts university. You have almost completely ignored the material itself. Your objection to the closeness of the predictions made by U/I is almost laughable. It's grasping at straws.Have you actually proven U/I is not credible? Of course not! All you've proven is that he is not particularly well known. That fact was never in dispute, and the fact that he is not well know does not reflect negatively on what he is saying. If we were to use the same logic about yourself, we can dismiss what you say because you are even more obscure and unknown than Ulsterman, therefore what you say is not credible. We're supposed to pay attention to someone who calls himself OutKast Searcher? Yet you object to the anonymous ""Insider."" Please! At least we know something about him, allegedly, something I addressed above. We know nothing about you at all.I at least have gone to the source here and analyzed what has been said and shown that U/I has a pretty good track record. I also, and this is important, am not afraid to point out when U/I is flat out wrong. You can't accuse me of avoiding the negatives because I'm the one that has pointed them out.You say, ""How can you believe something with no proof?"" My answer: U/I's predictions have proven remarkably accurate. He's only been completely wrong once. I don't ""believe"" it; I think it is likely. I've never said I ""believe"" all the material. What I have said is that you can't discount it just because you don't care for Ulsterman's bonafides.You say, ""What ""thing"" is already half broken open?"" Good Lord, what have we been talking about? A White House in disarray. An incompetent out of touch President. ""Broken open"" means that these issues are being addressed far beyond Ulsterman's blog. Even the Wall Street Journal has discussed these issues, the same issues that Ulsterman ""broke open."" This is no longer just a couple of obscure bloggers with no readers talking to thin air. Even Chris ""tingle"" Matthews is discussing these issues. That's what ""broken open"" means. People are dicussing it openly. It's no longer hidden. It is no longer being successfully suppressed. Even you are talking about it. And Ulsterman is no longer obscure.I had thought at first that your post was an honest attempt to search for the truth here from an angle that deserved scrutiny, i.e.: an investigation that could go either way. But it's obvious now that you have a vested interest in not even considering the material, not even addressing the possibility that there might be some truth to it.

381187,"Here's something else to consider: Bush got the most votes of any President in History. Kerry got the secondmost.



All this talk of the Democratic Party being dead, and beaten is pure hogwash. Out of approimately 115 million votes, Bush got roughly 59.5, Kerry about 56. Bush only won by 4 electoral votes, Regan won by over 500.



The Democrats don't need to change anything except get some more people out to vote. I don't believe any state was won by more than 200,000 or so votes, but I could be completely wrong on that. If so, it was only one or two states. The majority of states were won by very narrow margins.



There are two possible outcomes from all of this.



A. Nothing changes. The Democrats stay where they are, try to reenergize their base, and have another go in 2006.



B. The Dems move to the right, and try to adopt a more Conservative agenda. This is the more likely possbility, and the one that will help those of us in 3rd parties more than anything else. Here's how.



By leaning more to the right, the Dems will pick up a large number of Moderates who are uncomfortable with being clumped together with Evangelical Christians. Strong showings by other parties can capture the voters left behind by this shift. People like George Will, highly educated, Conservative, but not Fundamentalist, may become eager to find refuge within the Dems, or possibly the Libertarians or Greens. This is a crucial time for 3rd party members, and we need to take this opportunity to be as vocal as possible.



However, I have two numbers I want to share with you: 2,882,995 is how many votes the Green Party got in 2000. 112,440 is the current number of official Green Party votes for this year's election (this number is not expected to change much). The reason? Ralph Nader. If any 3rd party is to have a legitimate chance of making a run at the White House, they need a big name and well-known face to go along with it. Someone like Ron Regan would be beneficial, even if only in a Public Relations role.



Complete control of the Government by any one-party is known as a one-party system. It is the traditional form of government found in Facist and Communist nations. It is dangerous, any way you look at it, and is damaging to freedom. I respect your happiness at the fact that you feel your party has the power to pass certain laws you believe in, but Democracy is built on the power of the people to decide for themselves, not on the power of the Government to mandate anything. This is the foundation of our nation, and is sadly being forgotten.

First let me just simply ask that the reader listen to what I'm saying to you here; I am not asking for belief whatsoever- only to listen to what I am saying, and then consider the possibility:Look at the Genesis flood account. There is something odd there that most just gloss over- but it is in fact quite peculiar: there is a timeline embedded in it. Now, why does this author seem to think it's necessary to include a timetable in this story? Can you think of any possible reason the author thought to include that the flood began on the 17th day of the 2nd month? Why tell the reader the very day and month the tops of the mountains were seen? Or that the covering was removed on the 1st day of the 1st month?It doesn't look like any of the other flood myths needed to include specific day/month timbetables in their accounts so what gives? This question is especially apt if you believe that the author of the bible is in fact the Creator. Why would the Creator do something others don't? Why put this timetable in the account? Of what possible use is this information?In fact, of all of the events of the bible, you will only find 6 that have timetables embedded into them. Another example is the military campaign of the King of Babel. Of all the kings and wars and battles in the bible, there's not so much a mention of timing. But, suddenly, when we get to the King of Babel- there's a timetable embedded. Again, of what possible use is this information?What is the flood? It is a global judgment event, right? What did God call the military campaign of the King of Babel? God said that he himself was sending the King of Babel to judge the earth. Another event with a timetable is Purim (book of Esther). Purim was about what? Judgment. And then there was the exodus which God said was, a judgment event against the gods of Egypt.Consider my hypothesis:God is using the past to predict the future. These earthly judgment events are being used by God to convey the events of the final judgment of the earth; the ""heavenly judgment"" as it were. The reason God has put these days and months in the bible is because he is sending timing information to the generation that would be alive at the time of judgment. When these people begin to see these things coming to pass just as God has foretold in the bible through including these dates, then they will begin to show others ""these things are clearly coming to pass on these dates that were recorded"" and through this, sovereignty over creation is demonstrated.Now, but God is using the earthly things as pictures of heavenly things; so the Genesis 6 flood is a picture of something ; so don't look for a flood of earthly water this time, but a flood of ""heavenly"" water, as it were. Now, whatever ""heavenly"" water may be, I am hypothesizing here that it will be readily apparent, ""Okay it was Iyyar 17 when this 'flood of X' clearly began"" or ""Okay it was Tevet 10 when this King and his ""host"" arrived; etc.So there is my prediction; now let's all watch and see if we notice things occuring on these days, because I'm convinced that we will! Take note that my hypothesis doesn't include any years, since the only info that is being flat-out given is the day/month timetable.So that is it. Remember- not asking for belief at all- just, consideration, and then WATCHI am also open to considering other reasonable hypotheses for why these dates are being included; but so far only ""timing information"" makes any sense; and perfect sense at that.Isa 46:9 Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and, and from ancient times the things that are not yet doneEc 1:9 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

5 people help around, cooking and making tools



We can find more food then we need. Clean sources of water everywhere in parvatti. Around 800 waterfalls lol. Not to mention the massive Parvatti river. That place has enough to go around

You're going to need more than 3 people to grow crops for 20. Unless you have over 100 acres majority of your land will need to function for growing some type of crops (and not just food even), rather than just a ""small field"".You're going to want to check up on land prices in your target region (step one).Check for micro-regions where other people of your home state and potential thinking have also 'colonized', for better odds of assimilation.Check gun laws of your target region.Check seed importation laws. Will you be able to bring in an exotic seed bank with you for prosperity, or will they limit you to what is local?I'm kind of confused. It was my understanding that India is one of the most densely populated and undernourished locations on earth, and one of the key hot spot regions for looming ""Water Wars""? Even if it isn't in your target region, property prices must be a fortune (relatively).You're best bet might be to scrounge (Craigslist, yards sales, thrift stores, etc) up materials , tools and other equipment at 'home' for a year, and then pack a 40' shipping container to the brim and ship it all there in one shot, rather than move there and be limited to what can be acquired locally. Shipping a 40' container to Argentina cost something like $$4,000. Show up with a biodiesel processor and the like, to have a solid business plan.And why India? You'll be HARD PRESSED to assimilate. Argentina might be a vastly better destination for you, and plenty of people are already moving there from everywhere else.What does your Zeitgeist Movement propaganda have anything to do with surviving in India??",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

4. That we know what the atmospheric concentration of C-14 was when the

organism lived.

As we can see to equate a C-14 year with a calendar year depends on the uniformity of C-14 in the atmosphere for many thousands of years into the past

That means that the concentration of C-14 decreased rapidly with depth. This shows that the atmospheric concentration of C-14 was not stable in the past and such dating methods may not be as reliable as we first thought.

Gilgamesh and Horus are one and the same person. He reigned after the flood until 1968 BCE. Noah is the origin, not Gilgamesh.Carbon 14 levels must remain consistent in the atmosphere in order for radio carbon dating to work. The ""bones aged to that time period"" are aged incorrectly.""Radiometric dating and real time may be assumed to be equivalent only if the following criteria are met:For C-14 dating the conditions are:1. The material to be dated must be organic2. The organism to be tested must have gotten its C-14 from the atmosphere3. The sample has remained chemically and physically a closed system since itsemplacement.C14 Uniformity. Measurements were done on organic sedimentary layers worldwide showing that radiocarbon ages do not increase at a steady rate as one goes down layer by layer but, instead, they increase at an accelerated rate.Also all mankind before the flood lived for long lifespans, it is not just the 8 who were righteous before Almighty God. This is an indicator that the atmosphere at the time was dramatically different than it is today (thus radio carbon dating does not work pre-flood). Almost like a global flood event changed the atmosphere of the Earth resulting in a vast reduction in life spans and a sudden increase of Carbon 14 levels therein.God Bless,",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Anyway, back to the question,

I'll try and describe the circles of Hell that I have seen:



One circle looked like a massive, never ending graveyard. There were

countless open and closed graves, small and huge gravestones in the

shape of demons and gargoyles, or fallen angels with broken wings.

There were huge mausoleums, twisted tombs, holes in the ground and

creatures of various shapes were walking and crawling around there.

The skies were pitch black, and everything was in a tone of gray, dark

green, and black. A huge mausoleum led into the next circle of Hell.



The next circle looked like a never ending field of black and gray rocks,

boulders, rocky dirt, holes and caves. Here and there was some sort of

village, the holes and caves were usually inhabited by sort of nonhuman

entities, and the villages were inhabited by human souls, that made the

choice to serve darkness. There was this huge hole or gate at a side of

a mountain, that led into the next circle.



The next place was basically one gigantic, twisted, demonic city. There

were huge buildings everywhere, separated by streets, slums and alleys.

The architecture was like you'd expect in a place like this, everywhere

stone gargoyles on the ledges, jagged spikes protruding from the bricks,

statues of demons, dark rulers and an assortment of twisted creatures.

There was one huge cathedral like building, that had a huge hall and a

large golden throne. That must have been the throne of the ruler of that

particular circle.





Anyway,



The inhabitants of these places were very diverse. Many of them looked

just like humans, dressed in various outfits, mostly dark robes or leather

armor. There were creatures that surely looked like demons, but endless

variations of them. There were also more animal like creatures, but very

twisted and vile.



I believe the first place I mentioned, was the third circle, the second place

I described was the fourth circle, and last place was the fifth circle of Hell.

I think there are eight circles in total, but I'm not entirely sure of that. I

know that both Heaven and Hell are linked to every galaxy in the universe.

In every galaxy there is the Light of Heaven, and the darkness of Hell. I

also know that Satan rules Hell, and his sons are responsible for spreading

darkness through the galaxy: one son per galaxy. The Satan's son that is

corrupting our galaxy, is named Santanas, and he sits on the throne of the

fifth circle of Hell.



Everything that exists is bound by rules though, and whatever you have

been told, sins don't make you end up in Hell after your death. Only your

desire to go to Hell and serve the darkness, will have this consequence.

As long as you have not chosen to serve darkness, Heaven will be your

home for all eternity, regardless of your sins. However, karma exists, and

you have to make up for all your wrongs sooner or later. So just because

sins don't make you go to Hell, doesn't mean that your sins don't have any

consequences.. but you always get the chance to make up your mistakes,

no one ever judges or condemns you, especially not God.



However, it's very important that you are able to forgive yourself for your

sins. Many souls are so ashamed of what they have done, that they refuse

to enter the Light after they die. They don't end up in Hell, but they trap

themselves on Earth until they can finally forgive themselves. But that is

entirely their own choice. The moment they decide to forgive themselves,

they call for help and they are lifted back into Heaven.



I've seen Heaven too, through astral projection, and it is truly worth saying

""NO"" to the temptations that darkness might offer you. Everything you ever

wanted, is available to you in Heaven, through instant manifestation. Food

still tastes the same, a beer or a cigarette still tastes the same, even sex is

still possible up there, provided it is performed in love of course. Except

everything in Heaven tastes, smells, looks, sounds and feels much better

and more intense.



I've been approached by darkness, and I said no, in return I was attacked

by them ferociously for over two years, up to this very day, but I have

never regretted it. When they approach you, in a lucid dream or in an out

of body experience; tell them to shove their offer where the sun don't shine!



I hope this answers your questions, and I hereby swear to God that I have

not made up a single word of all this. Everything I described really exists,

it's up to you whether to believe it or not, I'm not here to convince those

that don't want to believe in the spirit world. I'm just here, on this forum,

to offer information to those who seek.



If you have any further questions, please let me know. I enjoy describing

Heaven much more than Hell of course... it is not a nice place to be at all.

I nearly lost my life there, the connection with my body nearly broke, which

would have resulted in my physical death, so they are painful memories.



But know that the soul is immortal, whatever you may read or may watch.

Your soul can't be consumed or devoured, your soul can't be destroyed,

your soul memories can't be erased or wiped clean, what's yours is yours

for all eternity, and nothing can end your existence. There is a lot of false

knowledge going around in New Age communities and extraterrestrial

communities, that your soul can be damaged in any of the above described

ways, but know that they are all lies. Your soul is immortal and extremely

powerful, once released from the body.



After my first few positive out of body experiences, I completely lost all

fear of death. If you want to read near death experiences, check out this

website: www.near-death.com It's got many interesting testimonies, not

everything on that site is the truth, but the testimonies of the near death

experiencers, are truthful, and very interesting. I advice clicking on the

""Notable NDEs"" link, that's the most interesting part of the website.



With love and Light and kind regards.

The Phoenix is a big missile, and it's airframe was designed for range not maneuverability. At best even under optimum conditions the Phoenix is capable of pulling few lateral G's and it's rate of turn would be very low.

At that point the missile is essentially gliding to the target and if it has to maneuver it will bleed energy (fast). So yes it is possible but like everything it depends...

I was scared to death. My brother was scheduled to be in NYC that morning and would, most likely, be at the WTC. I tried to call his cell, but, of course, calling was impossible. Thankfully, about 4 that afternoon, I found out he'd taken an early flight and wasn't in NYC. But, it was a rough few hours personally.

I decided that the only thing I could do was to go to church and pray. I live only a few blocks from my church and walked to church. I remember seeing people driving erratically and looking numb.

When I walked into the church, there were workmen, but no one else. They obviously hadn't heard the news and I debated whether I should tell them. Just as I was having this internal debate, their cell phone rang and the head priest gave them the news.

When I returned home, my husband was screaming for me to come into the bedroom and watch tv...that the towers were crashing. I stared in total, utter horror.

Hey People!Just a quick heads up as I've been locked away in a studio since I've been back from the SATTVA Sanctuary located below Mt. Adams in Trout Lake, Washington. We are very close to revealing our findings and video captures that we obtain and are hoping to have these all released (or at least as many as we can put up) perhaps by next week.In all there were over 120+ hours of video and audio captured at this little known neck of the woods called Trout Lake. Despite my bringing an enormous amount of gear and cameras, I was secretly wishing that I could've found room to pack more equipment. Anyway, it was only supposed to be a preliminary investigation and so we made due with what was brought. The only real regrets I have is not being able to get permission to climb Mt. Adams itself as it sits on Indian land. Of course from what we found out, it probably wouldn't have done much good anyway as it's shear face and volcanic walls and boulders would've only have been accessible by the most experienced of mountain climbers. I could've used some of 'semperfortis' survival and rock-climbing skills to be sure...lol.By the way... it was simply a joy to hook up with Springer and Crakeur in Washington, the two of them kept me in stitches all the time they were there with me. I was sorry that they had to leave, but was glad they gave me permission to stay behind because if I hadn't, we would've missed all the the cool things were going to be revealing here soon. But please keep in mind that there is so much data and footage that it may be weeks before it all gets released. So where ever they finally post up the ""stuff"", just remember to keep checking back there daily as it gets discovered and added. I should also say that of course none of what will be presented has been professionally analyzed yet and that may take even a bit longer for some conclusive summary of what we witnessed and captured.So, I'm still in the process of going through all the videos and am down to about 86 hours worth to look through.

34101,"Not trying to be smart, but you can say ""what if..."" about allot of things.What if it was 10x the size? Well it wasn't, and we know from past experience that truly dangerous space rocks are few and far between in terms of human life spans. The ones we need to worry about happen on geological timescales.Let me make another analogy - Explosions (or CME's as they are known) on the surface of the sun that are big enough to fry the Earth (if it was in that spot at the time), happen every day, but no one reports them in the news because it's unlikely they will affect us.Granted, Earth will never be in that position (at least in our life times), but the same thing can be said about our atmosphere which defends us from these objects - it will always be there defending us, and it is very good at it!So although these events can be extremely energetic, there is really not much danger from them.It would take a much closer call (bigger/harder/faster object) before we need to worry, and those are rare compared to competitively small events like this, that are all bark and no bite.Looking back into recent history, in the last 100 years there has only been one event that had the potential to cause significant destruction on the ground. I'm sure you've heard of Tunguska Also, keep in mind that many of the objects out there are made from extremely weak and low-density material. This material is after all the remnants of the building blocks that were used to make our solar system/planets, and because it was left over and mostly just orbits the sun in very loose collections of objects, it stays very loose and light for the most part itself, unlike the material that has formed into dense planets under the influence of gravity which squeezes out all the gaps and makes what was once soft, into hard rocks like we see here on Earth. So the vast majority will explode when they slam into our atmosphere.Statistically you have a much greater chance of being hit by a car (or the space shuttle for that matter) and being killed, than by a rock that is big enough to penetrate the atmosphere, but do you ever worry about that when walking down the street?Gradually we will be able to track all of the dangerous objects, but there are so many objects that we don't know about in the 1-10m range, it would be impossible to find, catalog, and track them all, as well as pointless since they are effectively not that dangerous. Trying to do so might even mean we are distracted from finding the really worrisome objects out there.Just enjoy the show if you are lucky enough to see one of these, and don't worry too much about getting hit by one. Life is too short to do so.By the way, if anything this event got much more news coverage than many events in the past have, partly because someone managed to get some footage of the train the meteor left behind in the sky, but I'm sure it would have been much more widespread coverage if someone had actually caught the event itself.

boy this post is moving faster than a plane attached to a missile !my two cents on trails, with focus on that 'blank' part, where it's not seen anymore:(ammo for both sides, I want to know, not judge)planers: contrails comes from condedensation, which means you need cold air. in the videos it looks like there's an inversion.the higher you go, the colder air gets normally. an inversion is where the temperature goes warmer again, till it 'breaks"" and gets colder again. this phenomena is mostly seen by clouds (they build there, because the water in the rising air is condensating) so you would have it at the level of the clouds. which is seen in the videos.meteorologists: inversion on that day ??missilists: the 'blank' in the trail could be the 2nd stage firing off.to the remark of phage, something like: the trails are blown away equally on all altitude levels, hence a horizontal movement, since the wind is stronger, higher up.true that wind is normally stronger in higher altitudes. BUT: when the flying object is moving up vertically means the lower trail-parts have more time to disperse than the upper part, which are built later. so the lower parts are dispersed slower (less wind) but they have more time to disperse.edit: addinversion: en.wikipedia.org...",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I played rhythm for my brief band experience; truly it's my favorite anyway. I play lead as well, but don't practice it much. I'll be 52 in September, and I've been playing the same songs forever. Without learning something new once in awhile, I tend not to play as much. To me that's sad; my guitars have been my best friends for so many years.One of the good things about these videos or even the backing tracks, is that they allow me to practice the lead parts with ""something"" going on in the background. That held me back for many years, and is probably why I always just learned the rhythm parts on many songs. Back when I was young all we had was cassette tapes. They weren't as easy to use for backing as the cd's are these days. The videos and backing tracks though, are far superior. Having accurate tablature is another thing we didn't have back then. We had the normal musical scores which were difficult to learn from with any speed. I always got frustrated with them and hit the nightclubs...I want to add a video by Alter Bridge, just so I cover acoustic stuff too. I haven't looked for the tabs yet, but I seriously love this song. One of our members here on ATS lost a close friend recently, and I can't keep the song out of my head because of this. This is a live acoustic version for now, and not really the best thing to learn from. I'll post a cover/lesson version later.

This is not the one I read. The other said either would work and I was reading about SCO2. The compressed air sounds cool too! Concepts are the same. Store in a reservoir underground, when needed, bring back to the surface, turn a turbine, pump it back underground when done.

Ok i read about that one, somewhere ages ago, someone even ran a motorbike on it.But it has it's downside, compressing air costs a lot of energy, creates a lot of heat.When using it (or de-compressing it) you will get a freeze effect as it expands.And then you have leaks.Leaks in a standard factory right now cost 2500 or more in lost energy, running machines at 6 bar instead of 10 bar means a 40% reduction alone, and a longer lifetime for the valves & cylinders. Trust me i know about this stuff.That being said, super compressed air can do a whole lot of things, like work in an EX environment, cut through walls, and power all kinds of engines, at least for a while.A similar system is in use today, from the 30's called hydraulic resovoirs.Simply a tank with a membrane, a huge spring, and some hydraulic oil. If the pump shuts off for some reason, the resovoir can give up to 400 bar pressure to (for example) stop a heavy crane from falling.Stored energy, a simple idea from the 30's still used today. Oil leaks are easier to find than air leaks, but the seals are more expensive.But the compressors of today are useless. Tesla built a small one that could liquefy air (which he used to cool his big coils) and was easy to build. That's the stuff we must focus on, damn i had a diagram somewhere....",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

yes, but when one digs deeper it should actually read that the law only applies to other jews. killing non-jews was ok in OT law...

one more thing... when did i mention WAR? i mentioned ""multiple genocides""



to kill an entire people (save for the virgin ladies, who are to be saved for a post-slaughter rape) is an atrocity... see the slaughter at middia for god's holy genocide.

war in Israel

God is a God of love and He is fair. He is also a God of vengeance and a jealous God. He makes the rules, He judges and He forgives or punishes. He is just as hard on His own ""chosen"" people as He is on gentiles. Sinners, and we are all sinners, err if we see Him as a powder-puff, all forgiving, never condemning God. He is not that.What you see as a holy genocide I see as punishment. In Numbers we see the people He brought out of bondage in Egypt. He saved them from the plagues and the angel of death and parted the Red Sea for them He continued that protection by clothing and feeding them for 40 years and yet what did they do? Complained and didn't follow His rules. Numbers 16:49 tells us 14,700 of God's children perished. If God punished His chosen do you not think He would punish those that hate Him?To me, your statement about God killing non-jews in a holy genocide should be a question about why He found it necessary. He wasn't just having a bad hair day.By the way, it was a war: Num.26:2Too, the Medianites were part of the family of Abraham. Median was a son of Abraham and his wife Katurah. When you say He wanted them to ""save the virgin ladies for a post-slaughter rape"" you are wrong. No where did it say that. The Medians were to be killed, in a war, because of the atrocities they committed. In other words, they broke the laws, rules and commandments God laid out and they were causing God's chosen to do the same.One of those laws was rape. So....do you believe He would have sanctioned saving the virgins to be raped? It is more likely they were to be saved, as they had not been contaminated, for marriage with the Israelites. They would not be marrying out of their family as Median was part of that family..........Whirlwind",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'd then stay in the office or find a potentially secure area to lay low at first and get a better idea of the situation. Closer to the action also means more reliable info and if things get really bad then I can tell the family to get as far away as possible. It's not always the case that they're safer waiting for me, they may need to get the f#$$# out of town first.

""You wanted an open war. We are heading towards an open war, and we are ready for it,""



In the speech, Nasrallah struck a more serious tone than he had Wednesday, when he announced the capture of the two Israeli soldiers and insisted they would be freed only in exchange for three Lebanese prisoners in Israeli jails. With dramatic phrasing, he said Friday that Lebanese now had two choices: either surrender to Israel's demands or fight with Hezbollah. He renewed a threat to carry the fight deep into Israel, which has so far suffered four dead from the scores of rockets Hezbollah has fired over three days.



""The United Nations' top humanitarian official, Jan Egeland, said Israel's attacks against transportation infrastructure violated international law.""

Okay so I’ve had a nice dinner and lived my life for the night, so now I’m ready to settle down to some fun filled facts. Let’s get ready to RUMBLE. I’m going to address you both in the same post.First off I would like to begin by saying that this is going to be extremely long winded, so I apologize in advance.The leader of Hezbollah stated to Israel:Ummmm, but does “open war” not begin by crossing the borders of Israel and capturing two of their soldiers without any provocation whatsoever?So, let’s analyze this here. Hezbollah basically gave Lebanon and ultimatum. Either join them or be occupied by Israel. Who would be the smarter choice here? Israel who treats their Arab nationals with great respect and is nearly ACLU like in protecting their rights as citizens. Or Hezbollah whose strings are pulled by Syria and who I might add have occupied and murdered the Lebanese for decades. Hmmm...gosh that’s a hard choice. But, undoubtedly the Lebanese will choose Hezbollah. Hezbollah’s facade of being protector’s of Lebanon instead of an international terrorist organization with an agenda is getting old. Which is the VERY REASON Israel needs to continue doing what they are doing. To say that Israel did not give the Civilians enough time to get the heck out of there isn’t fair. It’s just not a fair thing to say when Israel DID give warning of what they were intending to do and Hezbollah DID NOT.Oh, but it’s not a violation of international law for Hezbollah to fire rockets at innocent Israeli citizens and cross the borders of a sovereign nation and kidnap two of their soldiers. UNACCEPTABLE.There is so much hypocrisy going on over this issue I could hurl. Prime example: Japan’s announcement that were considering a premptive strike against N. Korea if an attack was imminent. They stated that it would fall within the ‘legal parameters’ of self defense. The international community supports Japan. Has North Korea threatened to use nuclear weapons against Japan? On the contrary, has Iran threatened to use nukes against Israel? Yes. Loud and clear. Hypocrisy.The international community wants to whine and cry over the loss of Lebanese civilians, but no one thinks about the continuous loss of Israeli civilians. And that is what is sad. It doesn’t matter as long as Israel is sitting over there taking it UP the rear. I never hear a peep out of anyone about that. You only become vocal when they decide to stop taking it UP the rear.You can call me a Republican all you want too...however, most Republicans I personally know are calling for the U.S. to step in and fight along side of Israel and basically wipe out most of the Middle East. Excluding Bush and Co. who appear to be ticked about Israel’s unilateral decision. So, naaaah I’m definitely not a Repub. And, I’m certainly not a terrorist sympathizer that wishes for terrorist organizations to wipe Israel and the U.S. off the map, so I’m not a Lib either. Israel taking a unilateral approach is the only realistic approach left. And it’s not some paranoid neo-con conspiracy suggesting it. They are doing what all Nations have the right to do. And this puts me in the Middle of the extremism being called for on both sides of the fence. It makes me extremely FAIR on the issue if you want the truth.Again, if I felt that peace talks would and could work...that would be my approach. However, they’ve failed every time thus far, so the odds are that they unfortunately will not work in the future. There are downfalls to this approach, naturally. But, if a different approach is not tried the resistance against Israel will only continue to grow until finally they will not be able to protect themselves. IF you don’t believe that the radicals would not push the Jews out into the sea if they did not destroy them first...then you’re not facing reality. I can step back look at the big picture and realize that Israel is no Saint. BUT, they don’t even compare to the evil that has terrorized them in the past. Israel has to survive and they need to do what they have to do in order to do that and not worry about what anyone else thinks of them.The fact that Israel needs financial help from the U.S. in order to accomplish peace is a GIVEN. Israel’s defense needs are great and unemployment is soaring due to the cost of cleaning up the terrorists’ messes over the years. To think that we’re just going to turn our backs on them and not help them when we're basically all the help they have is not only morally and ethically wrong, but it’s just completely irresponsible of the U.S.This is the third time (I think) that Israel has invaded Lebanon. Why do they continue to do it? Because of cease-fires and peace talks that only allow the terror to eventually realign themselves and gain strength. It is clear that there will never be peace through such means as cease fires and peace talks. Furthermore, Israel should not be asked to just tolerate daily rocket strikes and suicide bombings from whoever because the rest of the world doesn’t want innocent civilians to die on the other side. You can’t claim that Israel has the right to exist, but yet not understand the threat to it’s very existence.And as far as the BS about “one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter”...that’s the biggest crock ever. What freedom is Hezbollah fighting Israel for exactly? Think real long and hard before you answer that.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Several members of my family and friends had already died from Agent Orange, big men weighing under 100 pounds when their bodies finally gave up, when the US Government finally relented and started treating victims of Agent Orange after 1991; 18 years after the Nam war ended in 73. The US Government is still screwing over the Agent Orange Veterans, denying many medical care and making them jump through hoops for assistance.The US Medical Cartel will not stand up against the US Government striving to discard the severely injured cannon fodder and other suffering people judged disposable by the corrupt US Government. This same corrupt government would not hesitate to murder 3000 more on 9-11. Human beings are just disposable property; limited only by the potential corporate profits.It is not the individual nurses and many doctors which are the problem. It is the corrupt system. Apparently the government is afraid that if the toxic poisoned survivors from the WTC disaster are treated, bloodwork and laboratory processing and followup might reveal what really happened at the WTC to create so much biological damage to once healthy people.. It is what they do best.VietNam's 3,000,000 surviving Agent Orange victims of thewaged on their people and our own soldiers, are still fighting for treatment here in 2009, 36 years after the NamWar ended.We need aso we canand those helping to cover it up, and so the American people can force our corrupt Congress to pass legislation guaranteeing complete and long-term medical care and benefits for the victims of 9-11 in New York City.No more shoving victims of our government's crimes against humanity into holes and letting them die out.

I don't know how placing soldiers around the globe makes us a safer nation. I wish you would explain that reasoning there Taxman. It's doesnt seem like a defense strategy, more like the global police force with international precincts. Following my own chain of logic I would say that the more soldiers you place overseas, the less there are to defend us domestically. We are on our own over here between to wide oceans. Seems to me that instead of wasting money on soldiers to be placed abroad, we should instead invest in our navies and armies. That would be a truly defensive strategy.Cheney is only telling the truth though. With corporate politicians in office, you can't help but to assume that these wars would be, in effect, part of a plan to gain capitally from others conflicts. Especially since the VP's former company is a defense (among other things) contractor. This type of attitude is scary. A senior administration official creating conflict for no reason than his own greed. The problem with wars is that they can cause economic strains for multi-national corporations, worse, trade embargo's and economic sanctions.It is clear that Cheney feels that the war machine will increase employment, and strengthen the GDP. But who benefits from it? It's not likely to trickle down seeing as though the companies involved have ties to the administration.

I read a book not too long ago which spoke of this and I can kind of see where they're going with it.



Suppose that ""Atlantis"" wasn't necessarily an 'island' or separate continent all by itself, but instead a large nation that spanned parts of the world in pre-ice age times (10,000 years bce). I can provide the name of the book once I get back home, but it provides data to show where areas of the world would have been fertile that far back and provides a potential location for this ""nation"". Now - what if that nation had outposts in other parts of the world - ie - I saw a thread about a location underwater near Cuba. That's a possibility. What if what Plato spoke of wasn't necessarily the entire nation he witnessed destroyed, but instead a colony or outpost.



Furthermore, the author goes on to explain his views on the degradation of the materials used in the construction of materials - metal, wood, etc. I can provide the table later on, but it gives the approximate time it takes for substances to degrade into nothing over periods of time. If Atlantis did exist - all traces of it, save for things like the Sphinx and Pyramids (which many believe to be remnants of an anti-diluvian civilization) are gone.



There is also so much of the world we haven't even begun to touch - deep deep sea - what is under the ice in Antartica - many mountains and other sites where archaeology has yet to explore.



I don't know - I can kind of see where they are coming from - if such a civilization did exist, who is to say we would ever find ""conclusive"" evidence.

But, no, the car never existed in any incarnation prior to this film. TheChitty Chitty Bang Bang wasto appear in this movie, and it was built by the Ford Motor Company.Fact is, there were SIX versions of CCBB designed and constructed for use in the film: There was the straight 12-cylinder chain-drive racer (which was a functioning automobile); There was the non-functioning fire-damaged version of the racer; There was the beautifully reborn CCBB (a real, functioning manual transmission roadster); There was an identical CCBB with an automatic transmission (for actual on-the-road shots); There was a static full-sized ""gadget"" model with those distinctive red-and-yellow wings and cable-driven propellers; and there was an extraordinary full-sizedmodel that was fitted over afor the marine chase scene.CCBB was an entirely original automobile, and still one of the most admired and sought-after of all movie cars. The various versions of CCBB go for between a half-million and a million dollars, andhave sold for nearly a quarter million.The curious license plate ""GEN 11"" is an Ian Fleming invention, also, and is intended to suggest the word ""genii"" (or ""genie""), a magical entity from Arabic lore.Something that's always puzzled me about CCBB, however, were the two badges that appear on the car's radiator...I assume that these are Grand Prix Racing Medals (c.1907-1909), but I've never been able to verify that.

I see where you're coming from, but I also think you're avoiding the specifics.



It is not so easy to rile up everybody and ""reform"" their government.

We're talking about a very high level of corruption and lots of automatic rifles.



They live for their families, and if they think there is a slight chance of them getting back to the U.S where they can actually make a decent wage for their sweat and blood then they'll try.



This is why you see the men in the tunnels, because they had a taste of a world where you work and get paid.



Their are no jobs, no opportunities in Mexico. Wherever there are, they've been taken, and those people are in many ways slaves out of fear for losing that job.



It's a sad state of affairs on all fronts, but what real solutions do you have to offer?

I avoided the specifics because I was addressing the OP who seems like a sensitive person, and I didn't want to upset her.I wasn't implying that anyone try to overthrow the Government. Overthrow the cartels starting from the bottom up, and the Government will be forced to shape up all on it's own. Use guerrilla warfare and don't just do this in one location. Spread it out to make it extremely difficult for ANY Mexican authority, legal or otherwise, to squash it. Put up a fight no one expects. We didn't win in Vietnam or Afghanistan mainly because of those tacticsTaking just the guy who built his own underground shelter as a reference, I'm sure he's not the only one who is resourceful at living outdoors. Where do the drugs like coc aine originate? Outdoors. Apply the resourcefulness they have living outdoors to overtaking one field at a time. Like you said, there are a lot of automatic weapons to be had, and the one's who use them now do so for the same reasons that the destitute would use them to take over those ""bad guys"". To feed their families.They're trying to board a sinking ship and you and I both know it. The problem is, they don't. All these people who volunteer their time to help these poor people with water and clothes.......they need to educate them about the realities of America in language they can understand. All these jobs that pay a decent wage? They're pretty much all gone now, and the one's that are left have a waiting line a mile long. And if the illegals do get a job that 1,000 other Americans want, then they're left being hated in a foreign country. The fact that they don't care about that though says a lot about the one's that the OP feels sorry for.Go back up two paragraphs. One coca field is overtaken. Do you know how many landscapers and seasonal farm workers ply those trades here in U.S.? Take that number and then take it to the old coca fields and plant legal crops that can actually feed people. Have a chemist take the THC out of the marijuana plants to make clothes. It starts small, but once it does and other residents of Mexico see it happening and succeeding, it will spread like a wildfire. Trust me when I tell you that most law-abiding citizens in Mexico don't like what their country has become. You think they LIKE migrating up to where the Gringo's are? Hardly. Once they see their own making a stand and making it work, the movement will catch. They want to stay in their country, but they want it to be relatively safe like anyone else. Would it be easy? No. Will it take time? Loads of it, and this is where most Americans get lost. We've become used to things that happen fast, and if something takes years and years to complete, we start to lose interest.Sounds like America.That's about it friend. It may be ugly and I'm certainly not trying to rile people up, but that's the only realistic option I see them having. About all there is to add is that if all that actually does start to happen, someone somewhere with respected media credentials needs to be on it like white on rice. Otherwise, the CIA and God knows who else will start supplying weapons to the ""drug thugs"" so something positive can't happen. Do I wish for all of this violence to happen?

I believe America should be a strict constitutional nation, and the states should reclaim their rights, as well as the people. I believe in UFO's and extra terrestrials. This stems from an incident in 1965, that affected my entire family. I believe our government has, and will continue to hide too much information from us. I am always open to new ideas, and look forward to joining this community and becoming a productive member.

360871,"I really don't think this is something you need to worry about.However, for anyone interested I thought I'd post a summary of some of the relevant books and websites I've read in relation to stopping or preventing alien abduction experiences.Discussions that I've read range from the comments on the use of medication and/or psychiatric treatment, to a wide range of other techniques. Such other techniques include physical struggle or mental struggle with the ""abductors"", faith, visualisation techniques, the use of ""repellents"" (including iron objects, small electrical applicances and herbs) to the use of recording devices/sensors.I've outlined below the main sources of discussion of other methods that I'm aware of.The most comprehensive collection of relevant discussions that I've read so far is in Ann Druffel's book ""How to defend your against alien abductions"" (1998). See the reviews of that book on Amazon at:It is worth noting that Ann Druffel has summarised her views in:(a) ""The Encyclopedia of Extraterrestrial Encounters"" (2001)(edited by Ronald Story) at pages 491-493 (in an entry entitled ""resistance techniques against alien abduction"") of the New American Library softcover edition, at pages 480-481 of the pdf edition (with the same page numbering in the Microsoft Word edition).(b) in ""The Mammoth Encyclopedia of Extraterrestrial Encounters"" (2001) (edited by Ronald Story) at pages 591-592 (in an entry entitled ""resistance techniques against alien abduction"") of the Robinson softcover edition.Another book which discusses surviving alien abductions (but generally by discussing how to adopt a positive attitude, rather than preventing the experiences) is Michelle LaVigne's ""The Alien Abduction Survival Guide"" (1995). See reviews on Amazon at:Other discussions in books that I've noted include:(a) David Coomer in his ""The UFO Investigator's Guide"" (1999) at pages 52-53 (in Chapter 4) of the Blandford softback edition.(b) Charles F Emmons in his ""At The Threshold: UFOs, Science and the New Age"" (1997) at pages 178-179 (in Chapter 9) of the Wild Flower Press softcover edition.Material currently on the Internet on this subject appears to be relatively limited. I think the most substantive discussions I've seen of different techniques is at the website below (which, as the author of that website acknowledges) is largely based on the book by Ann Druffel mentioned above:For one particular viewpoint and item, see:For a comment expressing doubt about claims made for some prevention techniques, see:Kind Regards,Isaac Koi",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not so much with the ""Latin Kings"" who also use a Five Point Star, Although their's arises from the Puerto Rico Flag.The Latin Kings:Are as follows...Iron Team (Alchemical and True Color of Iron is Red) = ""Neighborhood Watch Program""Lead Team (Alchemical and True Color of Lead is Black) = ""Tenant Association""Gold Team (Alchemical and True Color of Gold is Yellow) = ""Building Management""Such are the three colors of the Latin Kings and with it their ""Mettle!""The Crown, whilst taken for granted and more often than not misused and repeatedly replaced with other crowns () is a tool which defines their regard for human affairs. Nothing else is to be attributed unto it.Human affairs which time and again play out within their community.Not many definitions.It is divied up into three sets and its base...The first set is the five towering pillars of the crown which are called points.Point 1:Respect... Although in their community it is more occutlic than anything else. It is not based on moral ethics. Instead on the potential leadership of the command. The ""Respect"" is code name for ""Psychology""A science which draws in unto itself a profound reverence we may intend to call hereafter ""Respect.""Point 2:Honesty... As stated earlier, it is more occultic than anything else. It is code name for ""Politics""This too is a science which bears heavy a toll on the community.Point 3:Unity... Herein found is an alternative to protest. Instead it is more reliant on penal codes and there enforcement.This is code name for ""Penalization"" and or ""Penal System""In street terms it is regarded as being forced to live under guidelines and hierarchies. Sadly tho... it is uneducated. However, if it is a science... it will generally prepare them for the ultimate assault on their community. They may well enough defend it or die trying. Untiy eh?!?Point 4:Knowledge... This is code name for the science, yes! the science known as ""Politheism""The belief in many deities. Whilst no one in particular is considered all mighty... they tend to lean more toward the understanding that each portion of deity and/or deities has a grand contribution to human affairs. Thus they do not rule out any form of worship and praise. This they do with cunning. Not with moral ehtic.In the streets you are hunter or hunted.Point 5:Love... This is code name for the science know only as ""Philosophy""Whilst it seems harmless and even at time pointless. Philosophy, to them, defines their tenets and codes, as well as their ethics. So... to make a long story short... Philospohy is the science of moral conduct!They place great emphasis on certain particulars and requisites. I can not define them for you under penalty of death!Moving on...The second set is what is called the ""Five Diamonds""These they substitute as representing the five senses of mortal man.However... it is not the case hereafter when community is involved. The former is just an instruction to initiate.The latter deals heavily with five particulars.Now, on to...The five stones.These genrally are taught to define rank. But again it is not the case when community is o involved.The first stone:Symbolizes ""Ownership!"" A dream come true in america!They seek to establish themselves as heirs and owners. Hence The ""Onyx Stone"" represents the absolute.Onyx is code name for operation ""Ownership""The second stone:Symbolizes ""Companionship""This is slighty off base. They are accredited with the ordeal of administration. These are not heirs, but rather individuals of choice and utilize every available resource to establish the higher custom known as ""Good Living.""They are represented by the ""Pearl Stone""Their craft is based on civil law and community renewal. These are a great contribution to the organization.The third stone:Symbolizes ""Membership""This is drawn from a particular class of citizenry. These are known as the (A dream come true in America!) ""Militia"" which is represented by the ""Emerald Stone"" ---> What more need I say!The fourth stone:Symbolizes ""Partnership""This too is a particular class of citizenry. These are partners in the human affairs and contriute aught but business and generate income. It is represented by the ""Ruby Stone""The fifth stone:Symbolizes ""Fellowship""This particular class of citizenry is more reliant on the spirituality of the grand scheme.They tend to lean more toward the sciences and the strong and profound belief in deity.A mighty fine class they are. Generals have been know to spur from this class. They are represented by the ""Amber Stone.""Note that each ends with ""Hip"" So if you see mortal king with hand on hip... blah blah blah.Lastly...

This event touches on what I have been thinking for a while. When things like this happen it is everyone`s fault. It is a sign of a weak society. We see, meet and know people everyday who we can feel are up to something dark and twisted yet we do nothing but deny our gut feeling. A strong society will not let those gut feelings pass so easily. It is better to at least attempt to talk to people and see what is going on with them. A cry for help comes in many forms.

That's really interesting and can be quite unnerving.My daughter and I once shared a dream.It wasn't a prediction but about aliens abducting tourists on our vacation.In my dream I am on the beach and other tourists are there with me. There are gray coloured Aliens, not like the pics we usually see, I don't recall seeing their faces or big eyes. These aliens had what looked like aluminum buckets of liquid lead and were dipping sticks or clubs into the liquid lead and smearing it on people. I got it smeared all over my legs. I asked why are they putting this stuff on us and they said it's liquid lead to protect against radiation.Then boom I am awoken very abruptly by the tv in our hotel room going off, the volume was very loud and we most certainly didn't leave it on that loud. The alarm clock was flashing like a power failure had occurred.As I started to come to I could not stop itching my legs. I went to the bathroom to check it out and my legs looked like they had a chemical burn on them, whatever that would look like, it was all bubbly looking. Like thousands of blisters. It's then I recalled the dream.At this point my daughter says "" I'm glad I got woken up because I was having a nightmare aliens were taking tourists away. A spaceship was chasing us. Of course I replied that's weird so did I. She was 17 at the time.My legs were so itchy and ugly looking I thought I better get to a doctor to see what was wrong.Subsequently we had to cancel our snorkelling trip that day.The doctor said it was nothing serious just a rash and gave me some ointment. It went away but left white spots that I still have and they never tan away each summer but show up more as I get tanned.While at this doctors office, waiting in the room for him. I overheard a women in the waiting area saying "" ... but I don't understand, I went to bed I was fine and then I wake up itching with this rash"" . I couldn't catch the rest of it because the nurse in my room was scrunching that paper up they put onto beds.The part that really got me was we asked others in the hotel if their power went out and they said no. I found one lady who said hers did and it was only our floor that went out.I have to correct my last line.

261973,"Getting back to the topic .....Here is an interesting excerept from an interview with Mikhail Simonov, the designer-general of the AOOT ""OKB Sukhoi""Supermaneuverability should be looked at as a system of maneuvers for close aerial combat. Once the pilot receives a signal that his plane is being tracked by an enemy radar, the first thing he needs to do is to go vertical. While gaining altitude and losing speed the aircraft starts to disappear from the screens of radars that use the Doppler effect. 10 However, the opponent is no fool either and will counter by pitching his aircraft upward as well. By that time our plane is going vertical and its speed approaches zero. But all Doppler radars can recognize only a moving target. If the aircraft speed is zero or simply low enough to prevent the enemy radar from calculating the Doppler component, for the enemy our aircraft will disappear. He may still be able to track us visually, but he will not be able to launch a radar-guided missile (either active or semi-active), simply because the missile's seeker would not pick-up the target.The so-called ""stealth"" aircraft are just beginning to emerge. The greatest impact of this new technology is expected for the fifth-generation fighters.11 The first combat aircraft created using this stealth technology was the fighter-bomber F-117A. Although, the aircraft never became a fighter.12 The aircraft had very low radar visibility but poor flying characteristics - a sort of a edgy flying steam iron (comprised of many flat panels the aircraft would reflect the radar signal away from the receiver.)13",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Tragedy struck in Los Angeles today as four people died after a tragic car accident. A commuter van holding ten passengers, two of whom were NASA employees, suddenly lost control and cascaded down the side of a dense mountain. Eyewitness reports saw the crash happen. Four people died instantly, one being ejected from the vehicle, upon crashing. Police described the scene as ""one of the most gruesome"" they had ever seen.I can't believe this happened, still no known cause of accident. The road was wet, although it was NOT raining; and no skid marks were found, so how exactly did this tragedy happen? Two of the passengers were from NASA's JPL control center.

I found the reply button. You say you are not a great communicator but I can read you loud and clear. You need to understand that what is happening is that you are participating in the oneness. There is something that we all have in common and this is the oneness. This oneness is both within you and within others. We need to establish new vocabulary parameters so we can communicate about the same thing with the same semantics. A sort of thing that has yet to de described with words, So let us say that the oneness is spirit and that spirit is life in us. Then we can say that our sentient bodies are flesh. Our flesh is our identity. It holds our memories our experiences, our names, our knowledge but the spirit has no identity it is singular or just one spirit. You posted under the inspiration of the spirit a question or a comment that the spirit in me can answer to satisfactorily. In the same way the spirit tells me what to tell you. A sort of revolution happening by the spirit. That our flesh is willing to participate mens that we are spiritually minded. Nothing to do with religion. It is a matter of fact religious minded people get extremely offended by my posts. I have been banned at religious sites with a single post. This is why I got the nick name antichrist. So to want to put me in a religious thread is a big mistake. Religion is what the carnal mind came up with to compensate for the fact that it is not spiritual. Christian apologetics is the application of scripture toward unbelief. The spirit and the flesh are in enmity and there is no love lost between them. To be carnal minded is to hold the spirit locked up in a dungeon of flesh so that flesh can rule. The true power and life resides with the spirit but the flesh having usurped the throne will not surrender it till death doth them part. This is a spiritual revolution and for those who rule this world by greed and vanity it is a mortal struggle.

Now this isn't the proof I saw with my own eyes. A year or so later Will was having headaches bad enough for him to go to the hospital. Will got his head X-rayed and CAT scanned. The day Will told me this story, I just laughed it off until he went upstairs and got one of the scans from the hospital (I can't remember if it was the x-ray or CAT scan).

Again it was quite a few years ago so I can't remember if the skull in that area was missing to or not. I don't want to add inaccurate details.

I most assuredly understand both that you are in support of this odious show of force by the Justice Department and that they expect to be able to use ""anti government or anarchistic literature"" against these people. Destruction of property is not so hard to establish mens rea. It does not require a warrant authorizing the FBI to collect literature to establish this. It's not as if someone who destroys property can reasonably argue they did not see their act as a crime. An effective prosecutor doesn't need to point to a persons collection of Marx and Engle's writings along withto establish that the suspect destroyed property with the intent to destroy property.Written materials such as correspondence showing a clear intent is one thing.

Although I was born into a cult religion (Jehovah's Witnesses), I spent my 20's as a staunch Atheist, thinking that the entire paranormal topic wasn't much more than wild imagination combined with people being gullible and superstitious. Now I just sort of don't know what to think about recent occurrences. I know some of this sounds patently ridiculous and that this is just my word, but it is what it is.



A few years ago I listened to an interview in which a professor by the name of Gary Schwartz claimed to have done double and triple blind tests on people that claimed to be ""psychic"", and got surprisingly successful results. Even though I never gave it much thought before, I did some research and decided to try out a handful of ""reputable"" psychics here in the NY metro area. Some were a terrible waste of money, and were less than convincing to put it mildly. Two of them, though, knew things that were not possible for them to know. This left me baffled and sort of shook my world view a bit. Since then I've read a number books and listened to many interviews on a wide variety of paranormal type stuff (not just psychic stuff). I'm loathe to remove my skeptic hat, but it certainly slips off my head at times.



Laborious background info out of the way...



Roughly 6 months ago I was sitting on my recliner, not really doing much of anything other than relaxing and staring into space after a stressful week of work. I'm not sure how to say this without sounding like a loon, but all of a sudden I heard someone with a voice that I didn't recognize saying something to me about the car I just purchased. Immediately this put me on high alert (as I thought I was home alone) and I snapped up out of the chair, but there was no one around and no TV, computer, or radio of any sort turned on.



This happened again a couple months later when I was lying in bed trying to fall asleep. I felt myself starting to doze, when again I heard someone mumble a few words then distinctly call me by my name. Again, I was instantly on high alert, checked out the house, and made sure the doors were locked - but heard nothing else.



Not more than few weeks passed when I had my first ever lucid dream. I never got why people made such a big deal about lucid dreams until then. In this dream I was being beaten and attacked by a group of people of varying ages, both male and female. I was in a hallway filled with furniture that I kept getting knocked into. I suddenly was 100% aware that this was a dream, but didn't wake up. The people (none of whom I knew) then backed off and stood before me. I couldn't believe what was happening, and was a bit in shock at first. The tall man in the center of the line then spoke to me, and it was a voice that was not my own. He said ""we're going to keep you here forever"" and then he and the others all turned their eyes solid black to seemingly intensify the hatred they had for me. Scary dreams are nothing new, but being fully conscious and in control of my actions made this feel way too real for comfort. I pretty much just froze for a few seconds, then felt myself getting angry over what they were doing to me. Feeling as though I had nothing to lose, I approached them and took a swing at the man who spoke for the group, at which point they all dissolved and I was able to wake myself. I didn't sleep well for a while after that.



Last month the voice phenomenon happened again, but for an extended period of time. I was awake in the middle of the night AGAIN, unable to sleep. As I do many times when I can't sleep - I put in some earbuds and find something to listen to on my iPhone. In this case, I was listening to a radio show when I noticed the recording had a man's voice with a thick European accent in the background. It got kind of annoying, and I was wondering why the radio host was being so careless with someone talking in close proximity to his mic. I turned up the volume and focused on the show, doing my best to ignore the background noise. It then dawned on me that it might not be something that was part of the show. I sat up, a bit startled, and replayed the last few minutes I had just listened to... and there was no one talking in the background this time. I used rewind, and checked again - still no voice. I didn't sleep the rest of the night and was just sitting there basically thinking ""what the hell, am I losing it?"".



As a child I had occasional bouts of sleep paralysis. They freaked me out a bit, but I never saw or heard anything weird and they eventually went away. Recently they've started again. Last Saturday night, unable to sleep as usual, I suddenly felt a weird sensation (similar to the feeling I've had the few times I was hypnotized) accompanied by a buzzing noise. When I tried to move - I couldn't. I tried to say something to my sleeping girlfriend next to me, but couldn't talk. I struggled for a couple moments before I was able to shake it all off, sit up, gasp for air and wake my girlfriend up.



Back on the topic of the two psychic/mediums that I couldn't find a way to dis-credit - I paid one of them a visit last week. I asked him the question ""am I losing it, or is someone trying to talk to me?"". His response was that a spirit (he called it a ""guide"") who ""has been associated with me since birth"" has been making ""visitations"" since I was 6 years old, and then changed the subject back to more mundane family topics. The skeptic side of me still has a hard time believing some of this stuff, so I didn't really know what to make of anything that he said TBH. Me from a few years ago would have said ""that's stupid"". None of this stuff makes sense to me, and I don't pass judgement as quick as I used to. So again, I just don't know.



Apologies for the long-winded post. Maybe I'm just stressed and not sleeping enough. Maybe I've read too many paranormal books and I'm imagining it all. Doubting your own first-hand reality is a disconcerting experience. Maybe I am just losing my mind.



Has anyone gone through anything similar? Are any of these topics familiar to any of you? Why on earth would these things flare up in such a pronounced manner when my life has basically been a rather dull affair? I don't take any prescription medication of any sort, nor do I use drugs. I drink sometimes, but none of these things ever happen when I'm gettin' my buzz on.



TL;DR - hearing voices when I relax, threatening black-eyed people talking to me in an all-too-real lucid dream, and the return of childhood sleep paralysis.

Spanning 155 miles, the circles, squares and other geometric shapes form a network of avenues, ditches and enclosures built long before Christopher Columbus set foot in the new world. Some date to as early as 200 AD, others to 1283.



Scientists who have mapped the earthworks believe there may be another 2,000 structures beneath the jungle canopy, vestiges of vanished societies.



The structures, many of which have been revealed by the clearance of forest for agriculture, point to a "" sophisticated pre-Columbian monument-building society "", says the journal Antiquity, which has published the research.



The article adds: "" This hitherto unknown people constructed earthworks of precise geometric plan connected by straight orthogonal roads. The geoglyph culture stretches over a region more than 250km across, and exploits both the floodplains and the uplands … we have so far seen no more than a tenth of it. ""



The structures were created by a network of trenches about 36ft (nearly 11 metres) wide and several feet deep, lined by banks up to 3ft high. Some were ringed by low mounds containing ceramics, charcoal and stone tools.

Its amazing the ""mythological"" status ordained on some of these weapons systems well before they have any sort of real operational capacity.



An interesting concept. We toured the Missouri last year at Pearl Harbor. I think it would be tough to install a VLS system on that sucker as big as it is unless you wanted to sacrifice a turret.



I also wonder about power generation.



But even just the 16"" main batteries with rail guns would be a alot of firepower to say the least

I wouldn't say it lacks real operational capacity. It has far more testing and has a much greater dispersion amongst operational units than the Chinese missiles that are supposed to be ""carrier killers.""... Unless I'm missing the point of this part of your post.Ideally, you would do a more ground-up redesign taking lessons from the Fast Battleships at the closing of WWII (such as the never-built Montana Class: www.history.navy.mil... ). However, talking a strict mod of the Iowa would have many implications that go beyond the scope of being able to detail in a single post.However, you could replace both the port and starboard Tomahawk arrays (that previously replaced port and starboard 5"" double gun emplacements) with VLS units. Since there are VLS compatible Tomahawks, this is not an issue, and the Magazine with the transportation links to the guns can serve to store plenty of missiles for various mission tasks. Alternatively - the ""Peripheral Vertical Launch System"" being used on the Zumwalt can be used to distribute launch pods around the deck.The 5"" emplacements would be completely refitted with two-gun (not twin gun) 32 megajoule railguns while the Phalanx systems would be replaced with solid-state phased laser arrays (the phasing of the spectra designed to create molecular shearing forces as opposed to merely intense heat).It really isn't that much of a problem. Steam and turbine powered ships can deliver just as much power as nuclear powered ships. The issue is the generators and the electrical systems. Consolidating all systems so that they run off of electrical power and placing a good pair of nuclear reactors in the sucker with high efficiency steam turbines will provide plenty of power to run even some of the most demanding systems - particularly if you sink considerable portions of the budget into a ""battle battery"" of sorts (should probably be super capacitors tied to high-current step-up converters; since that will be better than trying to figure out how to manage the logistics of replacing insane battery arrays that have their capacity halved within two years). In either case - power generation shouldn't be too much of an issue unless you're trying to engage a whole damned fleet single-handed... which should only be an issue if you're out of missiles or very stingy about using them.Indeed. It's difficult to say exactly what power rating they would have - but each 16"" Mark 7 firing a Mark 8 Superheavy 2,700 lb round at 820 meters per second is roughly 410 megajoules of awesome. It would have to be taken into consideration that the muzzle velocity of the 16"" round is much slower than that of a railgun, and thus the forces applied during firing are dissipated over a much different length of time... but we could probably push it rather safely into the 250 megajoule range with a railgun... perhaps even 400-800 with each gun in the mount if we do not allow for simultaneous firing of the guns (since this is possible with the 16"" guns - we can assume the entire structure is able to absorb roughly 1230 megajoules of force at once).That kind of power makes me shiver. The interesting aspect is that you could vary your target by the mass of the projectile. A lighter projectile would attain higher theoretical velocity and be more apt for taking out orbital assets... or targets on mars, in orbit around Jupiter... whatever... while heavier rounds would actually return to the planet and make a hell of a boom.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

202621,"True Nature and Convictions

Many questions arise when contemplating the supposed “true nature” of humanity. First and foremost: what is a “true nature”? Secondly: what is the psychological factors involved in this search?



MAN'S TRUE NATURE IS A FALSE NATURE



An interesting paradox to consider.



In my observations, when discussing man’s “true nature” specifically, it seems most people often contrast the “true” nature of man against the actual nature of man, or what man should do vs. what he does do. In my conversations with others, many enforce the idea that we should be something else, something other than what we are; for instance, that it is our true nature to exist as divine spirits despite nature proving the opposite, that we are constructs in a holographic reality despite the absence of any evidence, or that we are simply organic machines despite our mind urging us it isn’t so. Presupposing that man is not his ideas, we find these seemingly different conceptions are in fact the same, insofar as they are each conceptions of man’s true nature.



If this is the case – if man should be, according to man, not what nature is currently presenting, but an interpretation of it – we will find that every supposed “true nature” is, paradoxically, a false nature, being that each conception is an interpretation of ""what is the case"", and not ""what is the case"" itself. What is the case, what occurs, what happens, what goes on, is, by nature, perceivable, but always inconceivable, it is not words; there is never a direct 1-to-1 ratio between world and word. (At this moment, it would be correct to point out that my words here are also a conception, and therefore not truth, allowing us the power to regard or disregard what is written).



WHY SO PARADOXICAL?



Man, in his language, seems prone to paradox when language is taken at its word, whenever he has a sense of conviction or over-confidence in an ideal. We seem to me a paradoxical animal. What is presented to the senses always precedes what is produced from the mind; and therefore, our actual nature and true nature are one and the same, and who ever asks the question “what is my true nature?” is always the answer. Essentially, by committing the very act of asking the question he is giving himself the answer by being the answer. How is it that he almost betrays himself by conceiving differently?



Conceivably, there may perhaps be some underlying psychological factor, most likely a sort of desire or a will to conviction of some kind, where man paradoxically invents a “true nature” for himself to mentally rest his feet upon, lest he falls into a pit of nihilism. I think we can see this in any general metaphysical outlook, whether it be physics, quantum mechanics, religion, mysticism and so on, and is inescapable, and therefore necessary, as thinking beings. Whatever outlook is chosen, whether it satisfies mind or heart or both, is a matter of personal taste, and objectively irrelevant and a non-issue, but each time it satiates a desire of some sort, permitting ourselves to live our lives with a sense of mental security, or at the very least a foundation to stand on.



MORE CONCEPTIONS



Psychologically, it appears we do need a sense of faith, insofar as each of us seek and promotes faith in whatever ideal outlook we adopt into our personal cultures. It is almost as if conviction is necessary part of being a human, especially ironic in those who are convicted in maintaining they have no conviction. There seems to be no actual line between conviction and non-conviction, faith and unfaith, between stability of character and caprice. We are human after all.



Seeing it this way we may notice that seemingly opposite conceptions, both supposed “truths” – atheism vs. theism for example – can be reconciled by realizing that they are both conceptions, both falsities in the sense that they cannot by nature be the same as what they are talking about, both conceptions of God, both conceptions of a “true nature”, both ideas to which one adheres to, proselytizes about, and is confidently certain about. This is apparent in any debate where there are opposing sides. There is no essential differences between factions save for perhaps their choice in language and the intent behind their rhetoric.



So here is the question:



Is humanity’s true nature best described as what we conceive we are? or what is already the case?



Is it a question even worth considering?",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Many people, including even some Thelemites, consider the O.T.O. to be the big daddy of Thelema. However, as Crowley wrote in The Equinox, ""the Law cometh from the A.'.A.'., not the O.T.O."". The O.T.O. was the first of the Osirian orders to accept the Law of Thelema, but Crowley himself did not become a member until around 1912.



This is not to disparage the O.T.O. I think they have a Great Work to perform. If the rank and file members would purge the organization of its political problems, I myself would probably sign up.

You are almost right.The Temple of Thelema is not the A.'.A.'. But it was set up by that lineage.

Oversimplifying it a bit, the A.'.A.'. is a teaching order, and the O.T.O. is more of a social order. (Not to say the O.T.O. doesn't teach things)The rank and file members of the O.T.O. have no power to do any purging, in fact one could say most members (The man of the earth) are not even in the O.T.O. proper.

The newest video I have seen called ""A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Moon"" shows never before seen footage of the astronaughts in space. This video shows how they apparently were showing the earth from far out into space almost to the moon. Well turns out they kept the camera rolling (and forgot to edit this out) and it really wasn't a shot of the earth from far. It was really in earth orbit, they just blocked out all the windows except one, put a piece of paper on that window to give the earth more of a curve (or something like that) and moved the camera to the back of the space ship. Pretty much giving the illusion of the earth being far away. Of course what the astronaughts say during all of this contradict what is being shown for their ""shot"" or footage they were making for the public. It's a very damning piece of video. Plus there was a mysterious 3rd voice, not the astronaughts, not mission control but a 3rd unknown voice ""overseeing"" the whole thing. At one point the astronaughts were busy doing something and did not reply to mission control. Well this 3rd voice says ""speak"" and instantly the astronaughts reply to mission control.



Not to mention the many many obviously faked pictures, the absent rocket crater (what the rockets should have left when landing/taking off), the lack of any dirt what so ever on the vehicle, the shadows from multiple light sources (sorry but different terrain will not cause a new light source), how they fail to explain how they went through the radiation belt, and the history of what lead up to the moon landing. How the Russians were MUCH farther ahead of the states in every aspect yet they could not do it, how there was almost a panic of the Russians beating them which led many to believe once they control space the USA would be done for. How the government controlled every aspect of the coverage which was the first time ever the government would not let public new sources or the like have anything to do with a project. How many astronaughts died of mysterious causes. How Neil Armstrong never gave any interview for any reporter after this history had been made.



The list goes on and on. After reading up on the subject and watching all these videos and other information I do not believe the USA went to the moon at all. It's almost obvious they did not.



Japan or China (forget which one) recently sent a satellite to map every aspect of the moon, has anyone seen these pictures? I say this because most of the informants basically say they will take any kind of proof the USA went to the moon, yet none was given.

Do not get me wrong, and I think that you have, I do believe that there are 'conspiracies' to suppress the complete history of the second world war and I do believe that the general knowledge of the period is somewhat lacking. However, I also believe that you cannot expect everyone to be interested or find it relevent. I am and I do, but that is a personal choice.I realise that your post previous to this one has been removed, but I did read it...I am a product of the British education system, so my experience may be different to yours, but even so I was never taught the second world war. My year (the subjects rotate annually, or used to anyway) did the first world war and that was pretty rudimentary, as was all my history education. It formed a basis for my interest though. I can honestly say that the 17 years that I spent in full time education provided for no more than 5% of my overall historical knowledge base. The other 95% I have sought out myself, for no other reason than I am interested. I have no qualifications, I have no foreseeable means of profiting from this knowledge. In terms of the second world war, 100% of that knowledge is my own exploration. I am sure therefore you can understand my consternation when people claim that the history is kept from them, it isn't, it is just that most are either uninterested or want someone to package it for them in an easily digestible form. The truth is open to abuse in both these scenarios.Dresden was a terrible thing, I do not support it in anyway (and Slaughterhouse Five is one of my favourite books - love Vonnegut, hence my name). Hiroshima and Nagasaki are remembered though because they were unique. Although Dresden was unparalled in devastation and civillian deaths, it was not unique, cities and their inhabitants, all over europe were targeted by both sides, I think it is called collateral damage. Hiroshima and Nagasaki we know were different and these 'pioneering' acts supposedly ended the war, which makes them all the more 'special'.The Jewish experience is also unique in its own way.Civilians were indeed killed all over the world in the course of the war. There were many mass murderers and therefore thousands of mass graves. There was death and there was famine - over 60 million people died in the course of the second world war, and amongst all that death and destruction what does it matter that 6 million of those were of Jewish ethnicity. And if I am honest it doesn't matter, they are all dead, nothing is going to bring them back and take away the suffering that was inflicted up on them. What interest me more is why people want us to believe that it didn't happen. Since before the war ended there has been an organised and orchestrated effort to cast doubt on the Jewish experience alone.When I first studied these movements in the late 80s or 90s I dismissed them as crack pots and it is only since joining ATS have I realised how much influence they have gained since the internet started burning out the desire to read books. Without a full and varied education I can imagine that these ideas might be attractive and plausible, as frustrating as I may find it, I do understand why people may prefer to blame the victims given the propagandic tactics that these organisations use. With very few exceptions the information that they proliferate falls to pieces with only the most cursory examination, some are more clever, but on the whole they appeal to those that have little or no historical knowledge.Therefore I can only conclude that if there is a conspiracy to prevent a thorough understanding of the second world war and the holocaust in particular, that those people are behind the funding of the denialist movement themselves. Because one without the other is pointless. Only if you know nothing about the history as a whole can you possibly believe that the gas chambers and the extermination of the Jews didn't take place. In context the events make perfect sense, only out of context do they become in anyway unreal.Nobody has ever forced the holocaust on me, I asked about it but only after I first found out about myself. I don't feel that the Jews get any more compensation that any other group that is able to afford adequate and effective representation. I do not think that most Jews even care, and I agree with Finklestein that much money is being made in the name of the Holocaust. But all that aside, the injustice, the brutality of the Israeli regime, the profiteering of suffering etc etc does not detract from the fact that those events happened. And if you took the time to acquaint yourself with the history in detail you would understand it too and realise why others might want us to doubt it.No the key to control is in making the masses FEEL impotent. We are not. Unfortunately the truth is that most are quite happy to be spoon fed information instead of extracting their bottoms from the high-chair and feeding their own intellects.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The reason for involution is Delight - the Delight of Being (the Spirit or Absolute) moving to Delight of Becoming (temporal existence, the cosmos). Being throws itself forward into a multiplicity of forms, becoming lost in the inconscience of matter,[3] and then through evolution it partakes in the Delight of rediscovering the Spirit which had been hidden in the interim.



Evolution is thus the movement forward by which the created universe evolves from its initial state of inconscience (i.e. as matter), evolves animated life forms and mental beings (i.e. humans), and continues to evolve spiritual properties, and in that process rediscovers its Source. Such an Evolution of animated forms is only possible because at each stage of development, the developing entity contains within itself the conception of what it may become. Thus, the evolution of animated life out of matter supposes a previous involution of that animated capacity. This is akin to a seed that already has the essence of the tree that will emerge from it.



Each plane emerges from an earlier plane through the evolutionary process, which takes place in chronological time. But in a parallel construction, each of these new planes can be understood as being a descendent of its corresponding higher order plane from the Infinite. Thus, when mentality emerged in the universe, the universal plane of Mind was implanted to a degree in those beings harboring that mentality.



The evolution is the development of all entities in the cosmos, including humans, in order to attain their fulfillment, including the discovery of spiritual Delight, which was, and always is, the experience of the Source Creator. The evolution is the progressive development from the original inconscience of matter into life (movement, sensation, desire, etc. and living physical beings), and from thence to mind (in conscious animals and most especially humans - the self-conscious thinking animal), and from thence to spiritualized mind, culminating in the The Supermind or Truth Consciousness (as supramental individuals, and finally the supramental, i.e. a divine life on earth.) [4]



When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed.”



8 I heard, but I did not understand. So I asked, “My lord, what will the outcome of all this be?”



9 He replied, “Go your way, Daniel, because the words are rolled up and sealed until the time of the end. 10 Many will be purified, made spotless and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand.





Delight



Delight is Sri Aurobindo's term for ananda, and plays a large part in his cosmology and spiritual teaching. Delight is the reason for creation, by which The Absolute extends its Delight of Being into multiplicity, losing itself in the inconscience and then through Delight rediscovering Itself through individuals realising their Divine nature and proceeding to spiritual realisation.



In other words, the universe was created so that the Delight of the Infinite Spirit can manifest in all the forms of creation. When we discover our higher nature, the soul and spirit, we experience the delight for which we were came into being and of which we are a part.

One thing I realize about the Bible is this: Scripture requires keys to be opened properly. As I read the writings of early church fathers, it becomes clear that these keys are scattered around and tucked into quite corners of other scriptures. All continents on the Earth contain writings that hold these keys. As I was reading the Gospel of the Nazarines last night, I found one of these little jewel verses that offers clues to our reality.Gospel of the Nazarenes (Lection 88)12. For by involution and evolution shall the salvation of all the world be accomplished: by the Descent of Spirit into matter, and the Ascent of matter into Spirit through the ages.Involution is turning in on one's self (within). Compare this to Luke 17:20 Once, on being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, “The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed, 21 nor will people say, ‘Here it is,’ or ‘There it is,’ because the kingdom of God is in your midst.”Consider this Esoteric source:Are you a human having a spiritual experience, or a Spiritual being having a human experience?You may be asking me why I would turn to such sources for information. The answer is found in pride. Pride can blind and truth is found in all places you look. The way to know the truth is by eliminating pride and knowing truth by its fruit.Let me give you the KEY to what I just said. If you compare Theosophy (Do what thou wilt is the whole of the law) to Jesus (Do unto others), you get the answer to this. Giving and receiving is God's will. Taking is the will of the thief. Knowledge is neutral to this will. God gives to those who seek. What they do with this knowledge is expressed by the will to give and receive or the will of the thief to take and hide. Know them by their fruit. Either way, knowledge is the light that God gives to those who seek. Pride blinds and if you are blind, you will miss the truth that is there to be found.Back to the verse:12. For by involution and evolution shall the salvation of all the world be accomplished: by the Descent of Spirit into matter, and the Ascent of matter into Spirit through the ages.Here is another VERY important point to make. Can you take salvation by your own works? NO. Can you gain salvation by spiritual enlightenment and your own works? No. The salvation spoken of above is not your work. It's the work of Christ in and through us. God is raising His Son. Through His son, we are raised with Christ.John 14:6Jesus answered, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.This single point again defines the will of man apposed to the will of God. Salvation is a gift of God and not from the will of the thief. Again, we have a distinction between the Theosophical (Esau) view and that of Jacob (Truth).Evolution is the obvious result and not the central cause of all life. Evolution is a process to raise life from baptism (Immersion into reality). We are here to rise to salvation. The descent of Spirit is the easy part to define in this case. God's Spirit is the third aspect of light. Light is both particle and wave, but consciousness (Spirit) collapses the wave function of indeterminate probability to make choice. In this life, we do two things: We think and we move. All other aspects of reality are produced for us and not by us. The Earth turns, your hair grows and the laws of nature govern your actions. Free will can only do one thing: Believe or remain Ignorant (Ignore Truth).The reason you identify with what I am saying, no matter how hard your heart, is because truth is written on your heart already. Ignorance is associated with death and misery. Truth and life is associated with peace and harmony. Ignorance is multiplicity and Truth is unity. Ignorance divides. Truth Unites. Cognitive dissonance is created when the heart and mind do not agree. Bias is engaged by pride and ignorance. When you finally decide to drop the bias against God and engage humility, peace and harmony allow you to rise to salvation. You can only collapses this wave by faith.Hebrews 11 ( Quantum Mechanics of Salvaion) Faith in Action11 Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. 2 This is what the ancients were commended for.3 By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God’s command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.4 By faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did. By faith he was commended as righteous, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith Abel still speaks, even though he is dead.5 By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: “He could not be found, because God had taken him away.” For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. 6 And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.As you read the verses above, notice that your heart and mind agree. This is truth and those chill bumps you get when truth is expressed verify that you are in the right place at the right time.Deny ignorance and embrace Truth.Lection 89Speaking to Peter with allusion to the church age:9. And yet another shall arise and he shall teach many things which I have taught you already, and he shall spread the Gospel among the Gentiles with great zeal. But the keys of the Kingdom will I give to those who succeed thee in my Spirit and obeying my law (Law of Love).Daniel 122 Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt. 3 Those who are wise[a] will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever. 4 But you, Daniel, roll up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end. Many will go here and there to increase knowledge.”5 Then I, Daniel, looked, and there before me stood two others, one on this bank of the river and one on the opposite bank. 6 One of them said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long will it be before these astonishing things are fulfilled?”7 The man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, lifted his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and I heard him swear by him who lives forever, saying, “It will be for a time, times and half a time.From the WIKI linked above:Ignore(ance) robs you of what God gave you by this life you live. Bias blinds and pride destroys. Humility restores and makes all things new again. Love God and love others for unity, peace and everlasting life. It's pretty simple. God's law is love. Love others considering yourself one with them. God is ONE AtOneMent is atoning for your sin. This is not a work you can do alone: Christ did this for you as a gift. Unity is returning to being One with God through His Son. If you are against God, you are a house divided against itself.Confucius:""Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance.""""Ignorance is the night of the mind, but a night without moon and star.""""Speak the truth, do not yield to anger; give, if thou art asked for little; by these three steps thou wilt go near the gods.""""For all Confucius knew, what did he not know 500 years before Christ?

The Hebrew numeric system operates on the additive principle in which the numeric values of the letters are added together to form the total. For example, 177 is represented as קעז which corresponds to 100 + 70 + 7 = 177.



Mathematically, this type of system requires 27 letters (1-9, 10-90, 100-900). In practice the last letter, tav (which has the value 400) is used in combination with itself and/or other letters from kof (100) onwards, to generate numbers from 500 and above. Alternatively, the 22-letter Hebrew numeral set is sometimes extended to 27 by using 5 sofit (final) forms of the Hebrew letters.[2]



[2] According to Gandz (p. 96), cited above, this use of the sofit letters was not widely accepted and soon abandoned.

As some have probably noticed, I've been researching the Number of the Beast lately, and quite a few things have surfaced in the process. Like....==> If you write 666 according to the Mispar Gadol in Hebrew, you get Mem Final (600), Samek (60) and Vav (6), but since the Mem is final it marks the end of the word, so it's natural to read the numbers in the other direction, lowest number first, as in 6, 60 and 600: Vav, Samek, Mem (sofit or final) or Heb. וסם which reads USaMa. As in Usama bin Laden.However, the use of sofit letters (like Mem final) was only used a brief period and was soon abandoned:So by using this more widely accepted system of using pairs of letters for the higher numbers, we get:==>Tav-Resh (תר or 600) -- Samek (ס or 60) or Yod (י or 10) -- Vav (ו or 6)==> Heb. תריו «TheRIoU» (616) which shows Gr. gen. θηρίου (Beast) transliterated into Hebrew or written with Hebrew letters.==> Heb. תרסו «TaRSU» (666) is Heb. translitteration for Gr. gen. Ταρσου «Tarsou» 'of Tarsus'. Gen. of Gr. Ταρσός «Tarsus» the town where Saul Paulus was born.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Really, really useless for anything. There a better ways to build a card catalog of correspondences in you head. Can anyone please tell me why the Kabbalah is useful.

Most would say, ""if they threaten my family i'd kill them"" really... hollow words are enough for you to take a life? what can words do... when in reality 99 percent of the people who make threats never back them up.



Some would say "" If they break into my house and steal my stuff i would kill them"" So a human life is worth the crap you have lying around your house that can easily be replaced at any discount store...



I think the only real time for killing another person is when there is true threat of physical harm, when they are coming at you and wont back down.. either to you or your family. and not just a good old a$$# woopin threat, which many need now days.. but true physical harm.

or in a SHTF type situation, when they are trying to take the substanance that will keep your family alive.



I have many guns around the house , hunt every year, but not only do i respect the guns, i know what they can do and what that means.

I don't think it's influenced much by what you might type as participation. The targeted ads are determined more by your general location, what you've searched for, and your browsing habits. Not all ads are targeted, but some most definitely are. Advertisers like to get their info in front of potential/likely customers. That's why you'll see a lot of investment-type ads on golf tournaments and beer ads for football.



I've never seen that particular ad in question.



Personally, I have no problem with targeted ads. If I'm going to see advertising, it might as well be for something I'd find interesting. I've clicked on a few, not just here but from other sites as well and actually made a purchase or two as a result.

That's not quite right, and I already agree about ad hoc targeting, but a forum is a perfect target and can be lifted as you type. I'm a member of a musicians forum which is peculiar to Ireland, and in discussion over past events there, and pretty much peculiar to the Irish music scene at one time, the top banner ads began appearing in which could only have been a response to what the conversation was about, as we were all seeing the same thing in real time, and as the discussion progressed.Then there are the keywords, all part and parcel of the above, but you can also make them work for you if you are in the know, have a website and want it to be prominent in a search engine, something you usually have to pay for, they can be totally unrelated to anything on your website, but to just name that page with a search engine keyword, and it will become a 'first lister' at the very least in your part of the world.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Breakdowns, hysterical ‘possessions’, even suicides, without taking constructive/destructive criticism into account, are yet to be claimed as a result or special side effects. But the overall silliness of the phenomenon is best illustrated by the unfaithful reader who tried to sue me as an author on account of losing her sanity along with her virginity, purportedly due to the book’s supernatural effects.

Mind Control: fact or fiction?



Psi/Psychic Abilities/OOBE: Real Espionage Tactics



I meditate somewhat frequently, although not for any other purpose other than to take a breather, a break

Well, I consider it to be a fiction. Though, there are some interesting theories on how this could be. The award winning science-fiction/horror writer Dan Simmons wrote a book calledway back when. The whole book deals with a form of ""psychic mind vampires"" who use mental manipulation to get people to do things they want them to do. The book makes for an interesting, but sometimes cumbersome, read.On the twentieth anniversary Simmon's wrote an introduction for the book. It's some thirty pages long. In there, for a brief moment he slips into an extremely complicated scientific explanation for how his psychic vampires, who utilize mind-control, could be possible via neurology, evolution and some other things. Maybe the answer to your question is somewhere in the science Simmon's utilized.I don't know for sure if they could necessarily be considered espionage tactics (like in the 70s military experiments). I've met, and am friends with a few people who can do some small psychic things. After more then a decade of trying, none of them really ""control"" their ability. So I doubt it could be honed and mastered as so many New-Age writers speculate.More then likely, psychic abilities are either some new evolutionary breakthrough, or some once-abandoned genetic deficiency that is now resurfacing in the gene pool. Either an evolutionary throwback, or an evolutionary advancement. I doubt it is some mystical ""gift"" from some spiritual world.This is the original purpose of meditation. In Hinduism, and Buddhism the practice of meditation was utilized to slow the body, and then the mind. It was believed that in this relaxation — with the clutter of daily life removed — new insights to situations and the self could become realized.I wouldn't really consider meditation a ""spiritual"" thing. I consider it to be more of an alternative exercise. Much like Yoga. Both are given spiritual significance because of the clarity, flexibility, and insight one can achieve while practicing. However, at their core, they're just ways to maintain your emotional, mental, and physical well-being.And that's my 2¢ on the subject.~ Wandering Scribe",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
314302,"I had a NDE in 1977 when I was seven years old. I think my case is an important one because of my age at the time. I had never heard of NDE's until years later when I was in my late teens and was shocked when I heard that other people had experienced the same thing and described exactly what had happened to me. I had never told anyone about the experience, and I must say it impacted the way I look at life in general. I tend to think that this experience is what makes the paranormal world so interesting to me.



This is my personal NDE account:



It was late evening and the sun had just set. Me and my family were at a clothing store that was about to close in a small downtown area. Bored, I asked my mother if me and my older brother could go outside to the empty grass lot across the street. She said we could go outside but DO NOT cross that street. Boys being boys, we crossed the street. Once on the other side, a feeling of guilt came over me for disobeying my mother and I told my brother I was going back in the store to ask again if it was okay. He told me I had better not because she would only say no again and get us both in big trouble. I said ""well I'm going to ask,"" turned, and began to run back across the street without looking.



The last thing I remember was the headlights. I can still see them as if it happened 5 minutes ago. The next thing i remember was watching a strange scene happening on the ground from about 20 feet above the ground near the top of a light pole across the street. I had no idea who these people were crowding around a small figure laying on the side of the road. I watched with total detachment, I did not feel anything and was not concerned in the slightest to what was going on below. I felt complete peace. The next thing I remember was waking up on a stretcher as I was being placed in an ambulance. I asked my hysterical mother what was going on and she told me I had been hit by a car. I spent the next few days in and out of consciencnous in a hospital room. Years later, my mother was finaly able to talk about what happened that night. She has nightmares to this day about it. She told me how a crowd of people emptyed out of the store around me and I had no pulse.



I never saw angels or a tunnel of light or old friends. I was alone, but completely unafraid and at peace. I've heard other describe the warm feeling of being back in the womb, this is close. You feel warm, weightless and safe without a care in the world. Since this time, I've never had a fear of dying. Like most NDE experiencers, I know there is something more after we leave our body. I don't know what it is, but you don't die, just leave the body's 'shell.'



A few things I find interesting about the NDE, was that I was in a specific location, and had vision from a specific spot. I don't know if we are simply energy or what, but we are centralized into a spot and have vision as if looking from human eyes.



Could this have been a dream brought on by sudden trama? Maybe. But I was only seven then, and had never been exposed to any knowledge of NDE's back then as we didn't have a TV.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am not forced to buy anything but that is not what I addressed. You claimed the FBI would know. You said that based on Icke telling you. You did not base that on any information directly from the FBI. Please stick to the topic.I did not think that I shot anyone. I know Icke is lying. I was letting you know. The video is interesting and I am not knocking you for sharing it. I was responding to what you said.Expect any and every response you can imagine. I am not trying to be hard on you. I was simply responding to what was said. I was not trying to be nasty with you. I understand where you are coming from but when Icke tells you the FBI said something, chances are pretty good they never said any such thing. He has his excuses for why he knows that they know it but you will never know that they know it without him. Just check into these things when you hear them from anyone. This thread should show you now that the FBI clearly has made no such claims as Icke says. Satanism is an umbrella term used by people like Icke to label anything he does not like, cannot explain fully, and could never prove.Does he specify the leader of this Satanic religion?

345775,"I recall very well the LIES my Air force recruiter used to entice me into the service at the age of 17. It was the time of the Tet offensive and they wanted lots of warm bodies for the Vietnam scam.



I was about 15 lb.s overweight and the recruiter said that I would immediately, upon arrival at Lackland AFB, be taken to a hospital unit and NOT put into an actual class until the weight was gone...about 2 weeks. He said they would put me on a diet and with LIGHT excercise I would join a regular class very soon.



Well, when the bus stopped and we all got off, I told the Sgt. there that I was in the MEDREMP ( medical remedial ) program and was supposed to go to the hospital. The Sgt. threw his ugly bald head back and laughed out loud!! He screamed, at all of us:



"" Pay attention, all of you; YOUR RECRUITER LIED TO YOU!!! I don't care what the recruiter said, now get in line""! Then he turned to me and said: "" I will send you to the hospital alright, with a broken neck....GET IN LINE and SHUT UP about recruiters!!""



I decided right then that my contract was illegal, based on lies, and determined to get out as fast as possible. No way would I support an outfit that was run by liars. I ended up with a full honorable discharge for medical reasons, after a couple of Senators acted on my behalf. My father, who was a high ranking police official, had also been told the same lies and confirmed my account.



In other words, I had witnesses of merit who would testify that the entire basis for recruiting me, and others, was to lie and lie and get warm bodies as fast as possible. The Air force found me more trouble than it was worth and they were willing to back off and give me full papers to get rid of me.



Once I found out that LIARS seem to be very comfy as recruiters I lost faith in the system. Sure, some recruiters don't lie; but how many will use patriotic mumbo jumbo as a way to get people?



Telling a kid today that he or she will ' protect' us from the horrible terrorists is the standard line, and a total lie. When the real terrorists are in charge, like Dick Cheney and his cabal, using kids as cannon fodder for imperial conquest is sick.



How many kids would throw their lives away if you said: "" Hey kid, we want you to go to foreign lands and kill the people there, because we want their resources and because of politics...you can torture, murder and do basically anything you want over there because the Neocon bosses make vast fortunes from the wars they create"".



How many would you get then, Mr. Recruiter? Telling the truth would shut down the grist mill of human bodies sacrificed for the military/industrial cabal, and you would have to get a job that doesn't send the innocent to their deaths under false pretences.



The big shots kill the economy, thus giving them vast numbers of poor and desperate people of color to send to the grinder. No wonder they meet their goals!! Either risk jail by turning to crime, when there are no jobs to be had, or join the service!1 What a chioce!!



I think that EVERY recruiter should be audio and videotaped every time they talk to a possible recruit, and if what was said in ANY WAY differs from what happens later, the contract would be null and void. Maybe THAT would tend to keep the truth at least somewhat on the table.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Five years from now the killer(s) will go free even if (s)he/they testifies.



The 20th anniversary of the Palme assassination is coming up soon. Swedish newspaper Expressen has right now some ""sensational news"" about some guy testifying on his death bed about the Palme Murder case. He claim that he knows why Swedish Primeminister Olof Palme was shot and he knows who pulled the trigger. He said Christer Petterson shot Palme by mistake. Christer was going to assassinate a drug dealer for some reason and he knew that his victim was gonna come by right at this place. But Palme turned out to come by just before the intended victim.

His wife did it. His son did it. And so on... Did Stig Bergling pull the trigger?Christer Petterson died in 2004. He had just said live on the radio that he was going to tell Palme´s son ""something important"". The next day (or same day) he was suddenly found dead.

416704,"I said goodbye to my dying cousin.



Well, the main reason the Sep. 27th (or 26-27) stuff caught my eye was because 27 is my ""magic"" number, it pops up everywhere for me, and built up to a ridiculous degree this year, seeing it all over the place (not just in numbers I dig up, but like order numbers [such as today], highways/exits [such as twice today], looking at the clock [esp. 11:27], seeing movies pick ""random"" numbers/focus on numbers [such as yesterday], and many more), and I'm 27 years old.



Now this may seem silly, whatever, I see it a lot, but it's been the most dramatic year of my life by far. In the first week of 2011 a close friend got in a car accident and went into a coma which brought on amnesia. I won't say there's anything to this part but I told friends to watch out for a major earthquake on March 9 (half due to the solar flares which I know made others think of quakes, but also I ate a bag of ""Quakes"" ricecakes while talking about quakes not noticing till I had eaten half and finished the conversation... hah), then the Japan quake March 11. Since then just about every month (and more) something drastic has happened in the middle.



Around April 15, I got heat stroke/dehydrated and passed out on a job. May 14, I got arrested for a DUI and spent 3 days in jail. Obviously my fault but I only had 3 drinks and got caught because my car's tranny was suddenly dying. June 9 my grandmother had a stroke which we didn't realize until June 12 when she went to the hospital. On June 13, after coming home from the hospital, I got mugged- kicked in the head 20-(27?) times and got a broken jaw and one of the bloodiest faces I've ever seen- all for a cheap ass phone and no money. On July 7thish I got punched by a bouncer, yeah I was drunk. On July 16 I got arrested and jailed again, for walking in a construction zone to the bus, after having a drink, but no drink was on me (released 4 days later with charges dropped). I decided to be more careful with each incident but by this point I decided to hardly go out at all, and not alone. I willed August to be calm.



September has been safe for me, but I found out a few days ago my cousin who's had cancer for the last couple years and started to beat it over the last year, took a very sudden turn for the worse. She was like an aunt to me near 20 years ago when she always watched me and took me out and was great. She visited here in July in part to see how I was after my beating and see about my grandmother. This was also at the time I was hearing 9-26/27 was supposed to be the next doomy dates, and these stood out to me, because of the #27 but also because not long ago I discovered a close friend's ""number"" is 26, and for the past year or so we've joked (and sometimes seen some eerie patterns) that the 26-27th of every month is significant. Some truly were. But that died off overall.



Anyway, I came to realize I'd be travelling to say goodbye to my cousin around that time, and well, went to California to see her yesterday, the 26th. Talked to her while she was mainly unresponsive, then again today before we came back to Vegas. She actually sat up with help, opened her eyes a bit and smiled a bit toward me, and tried to speak, of which two words I made out. Everyone was very surprised. I also noted to myself (and a close person or two) that her mother died just over 27 years ago, right before I was conceived, and had shortly before that told my parents they should have a baby. I'm not having some delusions of grandeur or whatever other kind of mental illness, I don't think, but this number is not just another number. And I did put it in the backseat during this trip as much as possible- this was about my cousin dying, one of the most important people in my life- and no I didn't mention the number to her... but 9-26/27 will be one(two) of the most memorable and sad yet poignant (and happy those moments she functioned slightly) days of my life, and the one I'll want to always remember from this year, sad as it was.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
156744,"Has it ever occurred to anyone here that the price for oil we pay is largely SET by non oil industry SPECULATORS? Smart guys who have taken advantage of an open system devised in Holland the 18th century. The futures market. BUT it is OUR futures they are buying and selling! See Note 1.



Consider: Even though consumption is going down here, and stockpiles are going up, the price of gasoline rises almost daily setting new records. Even Adam Smith as old and slow as he is, will eventually take effect if we wait long enough. But in the meantime, SOMEONE is skinning us alive!



Cause: SPECULATORS. Well, you know those big Union pension funds, those HEDGE funds, those Sovereign Wealth Funds. Those BIG stock firms with more money than they are willing to invest WISELY in America’s FUTURE when there is 1) quick bucks to be made and 2) the US Govt ready to pick you up should it all crash! It’s the FREE MARKET made risk free, with the MARKET part removed leaving just the FREE part to the Big Boys.



Conclusion. So smarty-pants how do you stop those pernicious speculators? EASY. The No Re-Sale Rule. No entity can re-sell crude oil for sixty days. You can’t buy today and sell tomorrow making good money at a dime or a quarter rise in the PPB. Price per barrel. You have to HOLD your buy for 60 days, before you can resell it. That makes it a whole different ball game. This same 60 days to hold rule will CURE the periodic sharp rises in food prices too. It could spell the death knell to SPECULATORS before they KILL us. Let us STOP a couple hundred PRICE MONGERS around the world setting the price for our necessities.



Vote YES for the 60 days HOLD!





Note 1. A Futures Market. The Chicago Board of Trade is the oldest and largest futures market in the US. Other cities like St. Paul and Duluth also sell futures. So what’s a future? Suppose you are a farmer in the Dakotas who grows wheat. You put 1,000 acres into wheat every year. Your land generally produces 50 bushels to the acre so you can reliably expect to harvest 50,000 bushels of wheat in late October or early November. You invest about $$0.50 per bushel in seed, fertilizer and labor. The water is free. It’s from GOD. When GOD’s willing.



History. Your daughter, apple of your eye, wants to marry on the last day in June. This is 1890 and you want to give her and the new son in law the Grand Tour for their wedding gift. They ride a train to NYC then take a steamer to London. He’ll buy suits on Seville Row and she’ll buy flatware. After stopping at St. Paul's and Westminster, it’s on to Paris. He’ll buy shirts and she’ll buy china and porcelain. They stop at the Musée du Louvre and dine in the Eiffel Tower.



Then on to Rome where they will buy Italian shoes and stop as St. Peters. They will stop at Venice and Florence, said by many to be the 2 greatest cities in the world. Thence to Athens to see the Parthenon and down to Cairo to see the pyramids. On to Istanbul to see Santa Sophia and buy carpets.



Going overland to Persia for more carpets. Down to India to buy cotton and to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) for several100 pound blocks of various teas. Then to China for silk and jade. Finally it’s to Japan for the finest hand worked enameled furniture anywhere. A steamer across the Pacific to the US and back to a boring life on the great flat windswept plains of the Dakotas. A new child comes every autumn. The product of LONG winter nights? They typically keep that pattern until the mother dies in childbirth or the father becomes impotent. Hey that’s life on the high plains.



To make all that possible, Dad goes to the local banker and asks for $$50,000 for the Grand Tour. The banker - knowing the farmers reputation - loans him the money, and takes a CONTRACT for November delivery of 50,000 bushels of wheat. The banker loans the farmer $$50,000 on the contract. A FUTURE promise to deliver a yet to be planted farm commodity. It could have been on pork bellies, soy beans or corn.



The banker sends the contract for future delivery to Chicago and has it posted on the ""for sale"" board at the Board of Trade. There’s an auction held every Friday. Flour millers bid for wheat for milling into flour. If the weather looks good, the price they pay will be low. If the weather looks bad, then the price will be more on the theory wheat will be scarce. But look. Over in the corner lurks a guy with a lot of money but nowhere to put it. A gambler at heart he decides to take a “flyer” on the price of wheat. He bids against the millers and wins the contract. Now he owns 50,000 bushels of wheat to be delivered in November. He can sell anytime he runs low on money and he might take a loss, or he might get lucky and see the price rise. Futures contracts fluctuate wildly, often on rumors, resulting in unprecedented profits (or huge losses) on short term investments. And SPECULATORS are born! Our price paid for gasoline and bread seems to only GO UP all the time! So who needs speculators in the futures market?

Yes but they get new bodies that are created for their spirit/soul to inhabit because their belief in Him provides the path to that body.Not so hard to believe when new bodies are grown in labs across the world we live in now and doctors work with scientist trying to capture, bottle and map people's spirit/soul/consciousness.Jesus Christ being one with the Father has this and has had the process to perfection.The stories in the bible are full of stories of barren women not being able to carry a child and being denied acess to a child grown from a lab which is what the wealthy did because everyone was barren after the mass causalty event that occurred and a few select grew the animals and people from a sperm/seed vault ark but what they grew could not conceive or they conceived with huge problems. Something went wrong and they tried to fix it but could not. The people created from the seed vault/ark grew in population then broke off from each other and disbursed Many women were deeply grieved by not being given healthy babies from the sperm vault as that's how it was done. Had to be done after the mass casualty event. Which was the second one according to the bible as the FALL was the FIRST mass casualty event. Recorded in it. John the Baptist was likely a doctor who helped women and men become fertile and carry healthy babies in the womb. John was great. Jesus Christ came as the great doctor, the saviour of mankind to perfect the work John was doing by giving spirit/soul to the womb born children and their parents and community members by instilling the value of life, love, forgiveness, mercy hope. Alll to prolong another mass causalty event and naturally God givenly grow the population. Then all the women miraculously became fertile with healthy babies grown naturally inside them. No need for the seed vault/ark to grow them. Then obvious wars between people who grew people outside of the womb and people who could grow babies inside their womb flourished. Jealousies grew over those that could grow babies inside them and over men who had healthy sperm. Then the sabatoge on them began due to the wealthy having to purchase their babies from a seed vault . The seed vault lost money as more wealthy turned to the model and hopes of the real son of God who is One with the true Father, Dr. Jesus the Christ, aka God.The bible stories have said 'holes' because the 'hole' is to realize the ""whole"". When one sees the WHOLE, they see the stories from the bible are like what we see today. The push for designer lab grown specially selected babies and cyborgs and AI/robots, the push for abortions. The obvious war on putting a medical price tag on babies while still in the womb, invented modern physical and mental diseases subjected to them at an early age.

261593,"Hello everyone,



I’d like to introduce myself to you. My name is Cassie and I am from New York City. I have been a long time visitor of ATS, and finally decided to become a member yesterday. As a native of NYC, I have seen my fair share of haughty people that prefer not to question the world around them. I love my friends, but unfortunately, many of them fall into this category. Too many people are concerned with Facebook, iPads, and American Idol. Too few are looking in the skies and questioning what keeps appearing right above their heads.



When I was a little girl, the movie “Fire in the Sky” scared the hell out of me. Most importantly, it turned me into a believer. My mother has also been a believer of Aliens and UFOs for many years. We are always looking up in the sky, and recently, we have noticed an increase in activity. From bizarre contrails to floating orbs, we have seen more and more anomalies over the past three months. Perhaps not every day, but definitely once or twice a month.



Another interesting observation that pushed me to join ATS is the steady increase in alien movies, shows, cartoons, logos….are we being desensitized? Does 2012 have anything to do with it? The History Channel’s show “Ancient Aliens” certainly led me to believe that this is so! Were the Mayans visited….did they know something we don’t know?.....or have we, as humans, intentionally forgotten over the years? Or were we supposed to forget….or did our knowledge evolve into what we call religion….Christianity, Hinduism, Islam..etc. I have many questions.



I joined ATS because I have also developed many opinions about the similarities in the videos I have viewed, the articles I have read and the objects that I have witnessed. I am curious to know the truth, and I am interested in knowing whether or not the government is really hiding something from us-and if so, how long will this last.



Last year, world renowned scientist, Stephen Hawking stated, “""If aliens ever visit us, I think the outcome would be much as when Christopher Columbus first landed in America, which didn't turn out very well for the Native Americans."" He went on to say that he was almost certain that alien life exists. I am certain too. The “Pheonix Lights” incident is proof in the pudding if you ask me.



What upsets me is that many people (especially in busy, self-absorbed NYC) still deny that extraterrestrials exist. Some won’t even entertain the idea of discussing the matter! I am joining ATS because I want to share my opinions and see what others have to say about my thoughts……and when they come…well, I suppose the ATS community and myself can say….we told you so!

Chances are you will not find what you are not looking for.



find what you are looking for. If you are looking for 'proof' that we did not go to the Moon then you are looking for what cannot be found, proof for a negative.



go to the Moon then you are looking for what be found, proof for a negative. Looking for positive proof in favor of a theory or claim is the only constructive means of research.



Therefore the only constructive means of debating is also looking for positive proof in favor of a theory.



I agree with your reply here. I have also been reading this for entertainment value as the proof and real science is being argued/presented from only one side showing that wego to the Moon and menwalk on the Moon. There is really no challenge in this discussion because only one side is actually offering evidence of real science and logical explanations.I realize that there are a lot of very ignorant people running around but with some of the replies here in favor of a Moon HOAX is just too much. I really do not believe that these few members are actually that stupid, at least I hope they are not, so the only conclusion is that they are intentionally attempting to deceive us. The type of debate tactics that a few of the members here are using will show an observant reader one thing for sure, a deliberate attempt to confuse.There have been many times I wanted to reply to some of the more blatant false or ignorant claims but there is no need because all of these have been well addressed. The bottom line is this, and a good debater will know this, the discussion (debate or argument if you prefer) is one that cannot be proven as fact. In other words there is no such thing as historical fact.Even if we were to go to the Moon ourselves and physically look at the lander equipment one could then claim that these items were recently planted there as a continuing element of this supposed HOAX. What we have here is a thread that from the start is looking for proof of a negative and requiring any deniers of this false logic to ""prove"" what cannot be proven as fact.My point of observation is this;",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The info is on his own forum (unless he's removed it...).Of course, the only other possible explanation for the other 25+ hours of FDR data, hours when the engines were operating and the electrical system operating normally, would be for Maintenance taxiing around all that time, or for the airplane flying deadhead...and who in their right mind would think that an airline like American would operate an airplane non-revenue that much???Then, we have this hilarious piece:Well, the names of passengers ARE listed, and freely available after a short Internet search.If Rob Balsamo expects a company like American Airlines to maintain their reservations information from over eight years ago, and even IF they still have it, to offer propietary info like that to HIM, or to anyone, he is deluding himself.AS TO the crew lists??? Well, dontcha think, just maybe, good ole' Captain/Commander 'Rotten"" Ralph Kolstad, pilot extraordinaire (apparently) who actually once worked at AAL would be able to ferret out that data???MY airline has all of the crew scheduling computerized. I can get a printout of my time, by aircraft type. Not sure how much detail they keep, but American Airlines has a far more sophisticated computer system in Sabre, I would think, than some others do. Why not see if you can pull up the crew's old schedules from the first week of September, 2001??What's that? Too much trouble? Yeah...probably. Also, pointless to the extreme.""Arguing"" that the airplane at the Pentagon wasn't the same machine being operated as American Airlines flight 77 on 11 from IAD-LAX on 11 September, 2001 is foolish beyond measure.

But the National Socialists were the anti-thesis to the more established Socialists, the Social Democrats and Communists. And their rhetoric was anti-socialistic. and they lashed out against the Socialists and Communist in every speech.

Hitler and NSDAP were by European political definition a totalitarian & authoritarian far-right fascist movement.

Most Socialists and Communists were arrested and sent to Dachau and other concentration camps 1933-34.



Series: Great interviews of the 20th century



'No room for the alien, no use for the wastrel'



This edited interview of Adolf Hitler by George Sylvester Viereck took place in 1923. It was republished in Liberty magazine in July 1932.





""When I take charge of Germany, I shall end tribute abroad and Bolshevism at home.""



""Bolshevism,"" the chief of the Brown Shirts, the Fascists of Germany, continued, gazing at me balefully, ""is our greatest menace. Kill Bolshevism in Germany and you restore 70 million people to power. France owes her strength not to her armies but to the forces of Bolshevism and dissension in our midst.



""The Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of St Germain are kept alive by Bolshevism in Germany. The Peace Treaty and Bolshevism are two heads of one monster. We must decapitate both.""



Many who voted for Hindenburg were at heart with Hitler, but some deep-rooted sense of loyalty impelled them nevertheless to cast their vote for the old field marshal. Unless overnight a new leader arises, there is no one in Germany, with the exception of Hindenburg, who could defeat Hitler - and Hindenburg is 85! Time and the recalcitrance of the French fight for Hitler, unless some blunder on his own part, or dissension within the ranks of the party, deprives him of his opportunity to play the part of Germany's Mussolini.

---

I met Hitler not in his headquarters, the Brown House in Munich, but in a private home - the dwelling of a former admiral of the German Navy. We discussed the fate of Germany over the teacups.



""Why,"" I asked Hitler, ""do you call yourself a National Socialist, since your party programme is the very antithesis of that commonly accredited to socialism?""



""Socialism,"" he retorted, putting down his cup of tea, pugnaciously, ""is the science of dealing with the common weal. Communism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists.



""Socialism is an ancient Aryan, Germanic institution. Our German ancestors held certain lands in common. They cultivated the idea of the common weal. Marxism has no right to disguise itself as socialism. Socialism, unlike Marxism, does not repudiate private property. Unlike Marxism, it involves no negation of personality, and unlike Marxism, it is patriotic.



""We might have called ourselves the Liberal Party. We chose to call ourselves the National Socialists. We are not internationalists. Our socialism is national. We demand the fulfilment of the just claims of the productive classes by the state on the basis of race solidarity. To us state and race are one.""

---

""What,"" I continued my cross-examination, ""are the fundamental planks of your platform?""



""We believe in a healthy mind in a healthy body. The body politic must be sound if the soul is to be healthy. Moral and physical health are synonymous."" ""Mussolini,"" I interjected, ""said the same to me."" Hitler beamed.

---

""Our demoralised party system is a symptom of our disaster. Parliamentary majorities fluctuate with the mood of the moment. Parliamentary government unbars the gate to Bolshevism.""

---

""We want a greater Germany uniting all German tribes. But our salvation can start in the smallest corner. Even if we had only 10 acres of land and were determined to defend them with our lives, the 10 acres would become the focus of regeneration. Our workers have two souls: one is German, the other is Marxian. We must arouse the German soul. We must uproot the canker of Marxism. Marxism and Germanism are antitheses.



""In my scheme of the German state, there will be no room for the alien, no use for the wastrel, for the usurer or speculator, or anyone incapable of productive work.""



The cords on Hitler's forehead stood out threateningly. His voice filled the room. There was a noise at the door. His followers, who always remain within call, like a bodyguard, reminded the leader of his duty to address a meeting.



Hitler gulped down his tea and rose.

Then I feel a little bad for you daughter because of the little bit flawed explaination you passed on to your daughter about the ideology of National Socialism.National Socialism had nothing to do with that Hitler wanted socialism as an ideology in the sence we know of the ideology of Marxist Socialism ""per se"" - Au Contraire, Mon Ami! Hitler exploited and used the word socialism to make it a bit more attractive to the most uneducated workers and voters as a real new political alternative for them to the more established Social Democrats (SDP) and Communists (KDP).Heck! I have/had relatives who lived in Germany during those years and almost no one really understood what a hell 'National Socialism' really meant because it was something completely new on the political scene.(NSDAP and Hitler invented a new definition of the word Socialism - and the new definition was not about the old Socialistic defintion of Marxism, it had nothing to do with that! it was in fact a German definition of Mussolini's Fascism)They wanted and needed both the votes of the traditional urban worker base (Socialists SPD & Communists KPD) the unions, and the rural labourers - and in fact, the highest proportion of Nazi voters were in Protestant farming communities, and by 1932 the stream of rural deserters from DNVP (German National People's Party or Nationalists) to NSDAP had become a torrent. This together with the voters from the German ""Mittelstand"" lower middle class of small businessmen, independent artisans, small shopkeepers and the self-employed gave the National Socialists the victory (the NSDAP in reality recruited across a very broad social spectrum in Germany)Let's see what Hitler himself said with his own words about the use of the word; National Socialism -shall we?OK! here we can clearly see that the Socialism Hitler talked about it's not the traditional word and the ideology of Socialism, as we know the word; Socialism, like Marxist Socialism and Communism.What Hitler and NSDAP are trying to disguise with the wordis nothing less thanIf you want to have a fair understanding of the ideology of National Socialism and even Marxist Socialism you need the Euro definition- you can't apply your American political spectrum for a definition, that's impossible!And in this poem we can clearly see WHO the Nazis came for!!Als die Nazisholten, -habe ich geschwiegen;ich war ja kein Kommunist.Als sieeinsperrten, -habe ich geschwiegen;ich war ja kein Sozialdemokrat. -Als sieholten, -habe ich nicht protestiert;ich war ja kein Gewerkschafter.Als sieholten,habe ich nicht protestiert;ich war ja kein Jude.Alsholten,gab es keinen mehr, der protestierte.[edit on 6-2-2010 by Chevalerous]",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've always been rather skeptical of alien life on Earth. I believe aliens exist, but I'm not entirely certain they have ever visited Earth or abducted people and anal probed them.There was one experience from when I was a younger lad that I will never forget, and it still remains my only experience as of yet in which I saw a UFO. For the record, I really don't know what I saw, but I'd be more inclined to believe it was more government oriented than little green men.Years ago, I was with my friend one evening, and there was a lunar eclipse that was suppose to happen that night. My friend and I set up lawn chairs in the front yard to watch the eclipse, and we waited anxiously as neither of us had ever seen one before. I live out in the country, in farm town with little lighting at night, so the sky was crystal clear.About 45 minutes into waiting, we're both sitting there admiring the beginning of the eclipse. I turn around to go inside to run and get some beverages, and see a startling object in the horizon. I yelled at my friend to come look, and he too was completely shocked by what we were seeing.In the horizon, there was an object I'm really terrible at describing. It was huge and didn't really have a ""shape"" to it. There were lights on it, but they were moving lights, that moved up and down this craft. It reminded me greatly of a jellyfish of sorts, where the bright fluorescent colors moved up and down this ""invisible"" craft. The lights darted from the top of the craft to the bottom of it, and then back to the top of it. It was huge, and it looked almost.. organic, which I know sounds absolutely insane. To this day it's the weirdest thing I have ever seen, and I know my description isn't doing it justice.After a few moments of looking at it, the lights began dimming and eventually disappeared. The craft itself seemed almost.. ""invisible"", all that was seen were the lights, going up and down in fluorescent colors. It wasn't fireworks, nor anything else I could have explained. Because of its unexplainable nature, it haunts me to this day to think what it could have been. We both saw it, and both were shocked by it.I live near the Lemoore Air Station Base in California, and part of me has always wondered if it had something to do with that. I doubt I'll ever know. I just figured I'd share this experience considering it is very bizarre, and I've never been able to rationally explain it away, as much as I wish I could.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

a reply to: beenharmed However I prefer to write my own elaborated reasoning in the thread I started that contains core texts of Fatima as well as the latest development. I respect Phantomfire but I don't see the need to pour more water into his mill, in case he himself doesn't want to contribute to it.SO I will answer you here.Obviously, your spirituality is a bit different from what is believed by the believers of Fatima. May be we all need to correct spirituality, regardless of what church or not we belong to. The problem is we do not have any positive model to do it.Fatima appears to be the corrective of the RCC in the last century, along with other less promoted ""apparitions"". It didn't work as supposed to be though.If you reread Amorth and Martin with having in mind of existence of off-world beings (angels, and demons) in the meaning of more material manifestation (extraterrestrial), everything comes to its place except one the most important: the question of their POLARITY. Amorth is exorcist that means he should be aware of polarity of off-world beings. Martin also writes about exorcism in his books.I occasionally think, aren't we born in a prison planet with connections from outside world being cut off? Why should billions of souls be sent into such a nightmare place to spend their entire lives in sorrow, regardless of absence of major personal wrongdoings their entire lives in their majority? Are there past lives of those souls and gross trespasses of universal laws, to be paid in this life?Are we talking of a correction facility, of a purgatory on Earth where the souls are ""corrected""? Actually, few will leave this life bettered, more will leave it worsened, hurt spiritually more than when they were born. Are we therefore talking of not Purgatory, but Hell being lived every now and then, and especially intensified in the last century with the nightmares of 2 world wars? What lacks is the lake of fire described in some books of the Bible. A precise definition will say, the Hell or Hades the kingdom of the death, that is found in Greek mythology as well, is DIFFERENT from the promised lake of fire in some Biblical books. Apparently the Earth is still not turned into fire.Apparitions pretending to be from Virgin Mary and approved as such by the apostolic authority of the Roman Catholic Church, (one of them Akita, others -those of Padre Pio) say the fire is imminent and is coming, from heaven or otherwise.The big question before ALL people with GOOD WILL, as pope St John XXIII spoke to, should be how to escape that fire in first place. May be it is connected with escape the planet altogether. I don't know where the souls go after their death, and surely am not the person to determine what belong to God. But I know that the physical death left as only way out of the planet, projected to 7 bln ++ population, would mean mass holocaust. Steven Hawking just warned the world of that perspective, of a doom made by humans themselves. That cannot and should not be the only option left before already suffering humanity, to leave this planet prison. There should be an option different from physical death, to be given as a free choice of everyone, even the children, before not after the Chastisement that all those prophecies speak of.Everything else is an attempt to buying time, to not telling the masses the truth (John Paul II in Fulda), to try to predetermine their coming major choice. We have the right to choose, not only presidents but also our own personal/group destiny for the world to come. And that choice is not only to choose whether I want my soul to be after death: heaven, hell or purgatory. As I defined here and in previous posts, those categories should be thoroughly re-investigated, based on Biblical texts and modern knowledge. The thought of going to heaven en masse in case of nuclear war/cataclysm may be calm for the shrinking number of believers (regardless of the church) in their everyday lives in order to not to think any further about the perspectives they offer to their children. But surely such kind of reasoning does not suffice when we talk of a humanity with several major races and hundreds nations, thousands languages, diversity allowed and created by God (directly or more likely -indirectly), who are not all born just to suffer and die in predetermined end. Let we know the full truth, and be given a free choice.Once we are told of multi-world reality, not with one ultimate positive (heaven) and one ultimate negative (hell) places to go, but variety of worlds also created by God (directly or more likely indirectly), then we will have more choices to spend not only our personal lives but also to give beginning of new branches new civilizations of the old earth. For now we don't have that knowledge, I guess we will have only one positive choice that will differentiate further only after we cross the age of childhood. However that basic choice of a good place to live, be it this planet or another one, must be given to the 7++ billion souls to make.The case of past trespasses in past lives might have been convincing enough for some to send those souls on earth. Still that theory is not supported by any major Church, by the Muslim and Judeo-Christian systems of beliefs, and remains intellectual reasoning. If the 4++bln people who do not believe officially in incarnation, are born only to suffer for sins they have NEVER DONE in their own lives or the lives of their parents, that means something in that Abrahamic based theory FAILS BIG. It is better if the leaders of the Abrahamic religions themselves give the correction and do not wait for the correction from above. It may take place in a way they would not find it good for themselves, and for their predecessors in hierarchy. The least will be abandonment of current institutions in post-cataclysmic worlds and history books /videos of what really happened on the earth during ALL those centuries, not only now. I do not frighten anyone. But if we are told we would see our entire personal lives as on a movie at the Day we present our souls before God, then it is natural that we will see also the entire history on a movie, all wrongdoings of churches and other religious institutions. While I do not expect their miraculous conversion in the months left before the Chastisement, I have to say it for the sake of those who will be saved. The right of free will choice is inherited and cannot be redefined with theoloical equations as what is the free will and what is the free choice given to Adam and Eve in the garden, how that free will became less free with choosing repeatedly the evil. That might be a good point for Sunday school, but it doesn't stand the criteria of what the really Free Will is, given to every human being, not only to the so named predecessors of humanity Adam and Eve. Those who deny our free will and choice right now, will be terribly sorry very soon when each of us will be able to exersise that free choice. Not in the election of the next pontiff, but in the choosing of his own life line, and that of his descendants, independent of doctrines and predetermined ""solutions"" that proved awfully wrong in history.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

42529,"A unification of conspiracy theories:





I am writing this because I read. I read all your posts. I try to read all your replies. I am a naturally curious soul who apparently can not take in enough information. There have been many posts which have piqued my curiosity, and I have done as much research as possible into the individual topics and subjects, that I only strive to go forward. (apparently not enough fluoride intake as a child). In my job and in my life I have always looked for patterns, therefore it would be a natural secondary point to put some, or all of your ideas together in a giant “connect the dots”. Please understand I am not conceited or bragging. I fully realize I am a full blown nerd, and simply want to put my thoughts on paper (internet) before the build up makes me go insane. This is one of three posts I will put out today. I don’t know any better than any of you, and in fact strive for your feedback, so that I can understand reality that much more. I hope that is the reason we are all here.





1. It is important for you to know that I am non-religious, This does not mean that I am an Atheist. It simply means that the specific defined religions have not appealed to me as a whole.



2. I believe through extensive research, and personal experience that extra-terrestrials have in the most distant past, the recent past, and our current day visited us, and continue to visit us.



Therefore I pose my first question:



How would actual disclosure effect the people of Earth?



It is fairly common knowledge that 90% of the human populace are a part of a religion. Whether it be Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, or many, many others. These religions in many cases are not only a simple belief. It is the entire basis for how these people live their lives.

Let’s say that full disclosure, not only revealed that there were entities in this universe, who were not only far older than us, but they also can prove that they were the ones behind our creation?



How would thousands of years of programming, coming to a train wreck of a halt, effect the over all psyche of the planet? Is disclosure a good thing? Should disclosure remain a decades, or centuries long process, to bring this change on gradually and peaceably? Or should disclosure be now, and damn the consequences? Though maybe we don’t have a choice, which brings me to my first tie-in.



December 21, 2012.



For the last decade I have done, quite possibly, too much research into this pending event. I have looked at all the Mayan mythology. I have looked at the promise of Nibiru. I have searched and searched, and researched even the most outlandish of statements, to try to come to a practical reality of what can actually happen in this period.. THE ONLY fact out of all this research it that the Earth, will indeed, pass through the galactic equator on this day. I might need any physicists on this sight to help me out on this one, although anything will be speculation.



To get very simple, If you are north of the equator, and you flush a toilet, the water runs counter clockwise down the drain. If you are south of the equator, the opposite is true and the water runs clockwise. The question being: If this is true on the small scale, is it true on the large? Once we pass the equator of our galaxy, will physics cause things to reverse on a grand scale? Is the reason our planets revolve in the same direction, and travel around the Sun in the same direction, simply because we are north of the galactic equator? When we pass through this equator, will things reverse immediately because of physics alone? Will Earth stop spinning in its current direction and start in the opposite direction? Will the Sun after a stall, rise in the west? Will the Sun, and all the planets, immediately stall out and then begin turning in the opposite direction? If you look it up this has apparently happened in the past, where there has been “three days of darkness, or light” (depending on the culture) Then the sun rose in the opposite direction. Not to be a fear monger, but the last time we passed through the galactic equator, is roughly the same time that the Neanderthals went extinct.



Which brings me to my next tie in:



Is disclosure not only necessary but imminent, because getting off the planet in extraterrestrial ships, is the only way to assure the survival of our species?



Next tie in:



Are TPTB trying to kill as many of us as possible, before this becomes a reality? Would we go to war with extremist Muslims, if we knew they were going to be the greatest threat to this story? What about North Korea? What about anybody else that would throw a monkey wrench into this scenario? Iran? If a country was not a nuclear power, or for that matter close to being, we would not worry about them. They would not be able to defend their religion and stop the ET ships from saving us. They will either go with them, or possibly die on a massive scale on Earth.



Next tie in:



The “New World Order”. Yes this scenario is talked about quite frequently, and I believe it is a reality. I think the problem is that people have not broken up the words, to understand the true meaning. Based on my theories the “New World Order”, becomes the “New World’ order. Yes, if in-fact the rest is correct, than TPTB are planning for a way to return “Order” on a “New World” that we eventually return to. In other words, “we’re not about to give up control, NO MATTER WHAT.”





I would like as many responses to this as possible, whether positive or negative. It is the only way I continue to learn.



Thank you ATS for allowing me to empty my brain in script..

This thread is misleading and contrary to the scriptures. There is no such thing as a ""spirit guide"" at least not for those who follow Christ. The only guide that a true believer in Christ should listen to is the Holy Spirit, which lives in us, if you believe of course.If you need answers from the Lord then justfor His answer. Seeking answers from angels or other types of spirits will only lead you astray. Remember, even Satan believes that Jesus came in the flesh, so for a spirit to admit this to you means nothing.""14 And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works."" 2 Corinthians 11I'm not saying that we don't have angles who watch over us, all I'm saying is that you should not be asking them for answers. There are alot of people being deceived into thinking that contacting spirits is the best way to find what they are looking for, it is a very dangerous game to be playing.Christ said ""whatever you ask the Father inHe will give you. John 16:23"" not the name of a different spirit. And like wise ""Then you willand go and, and I will listen to you. Jeremiah 29:12"", and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know. Jeremiah 33:3’I could point out a bunch more but I think you get the point. Both God and Jesus tells us to ask ""God"" for the answers to our questions, no one else. Be careful brothers and sisters, and may the Lord be with you.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I saw it through the drivers window for a split second, but it disappeared into the blind spot between that window and the windshield and flashed out right there. When it flashed out, it filled the inside of the van with a bright, blue light.



Me friend was already staring out the window and saw the entire thing. It hurt both of their eyes pretty bad when it disappeared, and I could pretty much imagine from what I saw lighting up the interior. It was maybe a mile or mile and a half away from us, and judging from that distance it was maybe 15 - 20 feet wide. It had wispy lines coming out of it, and when it flashed out it grew out in every direction like a ""wa-womph!"" It didn't make any noise.



So I thought that was pretty damn cool.



Now for the part that I wasn't sure belonged in this section. It got me thinking about how our ancestors described stars falling from the heavens. Some people thought that might be a pole shift causing the Earth to move around wildly, and so the stars would look like they were setting into the horizon. I was thinking that they might have been mistaken when they saw ball lightning falling all over the place, scorching the land.



It seems the sun is putting out way more energy these days. We've had these really powerful hurricanes, 400+ tornadoes so far compared to only 90 last year, the weather is going nuts, and comets are breaking way out there around saturn compared to when they usually pass around the sun.

Inmates in a prison in the US state of Georgia are striking, demanding the justice system provide them with better medical and health care, wages, and additional educational opportunities.

Thus far the strike has been peaceful and non-violent, with inmates refusing to do their assigned work duties, opting to leave their cells only for food and showers.

Link to article:This article is about a week old. The latest news on this is that officials are now meeting to negotiate with the prisoners and families. Anyway,the subject of justice and incarceration is complex so I'm only going to address my take on a small part of it.I think this astounding just in the fact alone that prisoners were able to set aside their sometimes staggering differences and join together in a peaceful and intelligent manner in order to be heard. Prisoners have long been stigmatized as mostly being low-brow,self-serving,feral animals. While this may be true in a few cases,this articles shows us that prisoners aren't all stupid and that people can change,whether willingly or by force.In this case, I believe the prisoners had simply had enough and realized that by being socially divided,they were hurting their chances at getting anything beneficial done for the prison system as a whole. I also think the prisoners have been hearing about how bad things are on the outside and simply want a chance at a much-needed head-start on things for if,and when, they are released. They probably realize that the lowly jobs many of them used to take after being released are being given to people with Ph.D.s and are scared enough by this to finally want to take charge of their lives and start being productive.The irony is that society has been howling for decades for inmates to do something with themselves and become more productive and rehabilitated and now the inmates have decided to do so at what is absolutely the worst possible time economically,socially and politically,not just in America, but the world as whole.Even if the their demands are met, it seems highly unlikely that it will make any real difference once they get out. There simply isn't enough time,money or political will-power left in this country to make room for them in what is now a rapidly crumbling country. I fear they will become bitter and hateful and commit more crime to simply return back to the relative comfort and safety of their former prison routine.No matter your take on this, I hope we can all agree on the that fact that prisoners aren't just failures to themselves or society,but society is a failure as a whole when America has the highest incarceration rate in the world.

399127,"Thank you everyone, for your replies. This is an important issue, and I'm glad it's generating discussion.apc, craigI agree 100%. You took the words right out of my mouth.I agree that humans are not likely to contribute heavily to the natural process we're witnessing, and I also agree that the planet will survive by bouncing back and forth, just as it always has, regardless of our fate.One smallish volcano eruption puts the combined emissions of every car on earth to shame, and there are many, many eruptions every year. Now we've also got to worry about the 'downhill' effect. Once you've crested the top of the hill, and started down again, your speed will increase dramatically.We have to figure out how to survive, at this point. Placing blame is of secondary importance, if it's important at all. Basically, we can't stop the process, we probably can't even slow it down measurably (this buggy has no brakes!), so how do we weather the storm? That's the issue I think should be taking center stage, instead of political agreements and summits on the minutia of acceptable emissions thresholds and whatnot.What the human race needs more than anything, in my opinion, is a replay, a free ball. We need either permanent space colonies, or a serious commitment to terraforming a nearby planet. If we don't get some folks off this rock, the species WILL, eventually, become extinct one way or another. That's the bottom line, as I see it. What better excuse for long term space habitation than global warming? Do we need a meteor impact or something to convince people this spinning ball of crusted-over molten metal isn't safe for permanent habitation?SkepticThanks very much.This place certainly does rock, we're consistently in front of the 8 ball, instead of behind.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

our species exists? what does that prove? it proves that our species exists, and thats about it. our species existing does not prove that dinosaurs existed millions of years ago.



I dont know how many times I have to explain carbon dating, it doesnt work. carbon dating does not work at all. its not accurate no matter how old the object is.



as for surviving against a dinosaur, the bible points out that there were giants in teh earth before the flood and some after. if there were giants, im sure that people had a pretty good chance surviving against dinosaurs.

36060,"This is another one of those Eminent Domain cases, where a city or town seeks to garnishee property on the premise that the greater social good will be done. In this case, the town lost and the little guy won, but that is not the reason for the story. The thing that struck me as a pure work of art was the logic and reasoning used by the ruling judge in this case.The litigants in this case were the Defendant(s), represented by the Town of Lodi, NJ who together with a group of planners and businessmen formed Lodi 46 Renewal LLC.The Plaintiff(s) were represented by the owners of the Costa and Brown trailer parks, which house about 500 people combined. They had sued a decision by the town which would have targeted the trailer parks for redevelopment under the state's Eminent Domain clause. The plan would have generated approximately $3 million in tax revenue from a gated senior community with 250 housing units and 112,000 square feet of retail space. The two trailer parks combined currently generate about $250,000 in tax revenues, so financially, the plan made good sense.Sitting in judgement of these facts was Superior Court Judge Richard Donohue. After listening to arguments from both sides, he ruled against the Town of Lodi and in favor of the owners of the trailer parks. He used sound reasoning to reach his decision. Here are some clips from his ruling:He ruled that Lodi cannot condemn the trailer parks and that the redevelopment proposal is ""vague.""He said that while the borough may have proposed a plan classified as a ""public purpose"" required by state eminent domain laws, its planners failed to prove the trailer park land is either obsolete, underutilized or meets other criteria necessary to be considered for redevelopment, and, ""In short, there was a complete lack of detailed specific proofs as to why the property should be designated as in need of redevelopment"".And finally, to prove that his decision was not based on politics:(Lodi Mayor Gary) Paparozzi said yesterday that the borough is a victim of the uproar over eminent domain generated by the U.S. Supreme Court's Kelo vs. City of New London, Conn., decision earlier this year. In that case, the court ruled, 5-4, that municipalities have broad power to condemn people's property in favor of private development to generate tax revenue.In his ruling, Donohue said the Kelo decision also precludes any state from placing further restrictions on eminent domain powers. He said he based his decision on New Jersey's statutes, which are stricter than Connecticut's.Further, Donohue said he did not intend to judge New Jersey's statute or Lodi's political motives.""This court's role is not to determine whether the actions taken by Lodi are sound decisions or effective governance, but rather, if Lodi has acted in accordance with the law,"" Donohue wrote in his decision.So, that's it. Why did this story catch my eye? It was because of the principles the judge used to reached his decision.There are far too many cases of poor performance by our judges in this country. From the infamous reversals of lower courts by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to a Minnesota judge who frees a convicted child molestor on low bail resulting in 4 more murders, a week does not go by without hearing of another case of poor adjudication, or of ""legislating from the bench"".In this case, the judge did his job without oversteppping his bounds. And his reasons were sound, imo. Reading about this case was a refreshing change from so much bad news these days and was worth sharing.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
311852,"It concerns me that this is`nt talked about especially here on ATS,its a very touchy subject that affects most of us in the western world but one that needs to be heard if you have no idea it exists.Over the past 18 years that i`m aware of here in Australia (but in no way exclusive to)since they brought in the no blame divorce laws in 1988 there is a growing acceptance through the push of the Governments, media and is common in most modern day movies to portray Fathers as dead beat dads in after divorce.That very word is offensive knowing full well what happens to fathers who divorce be it their decision or their wifes,its usually the women who initiates it.Not that i blame women i blame the Government`s for dangling the carrot so to speak,that this is an option where they can for what ever reason destroy their family and husband and be financially better off.Debunking Divorce MythsI would hazard a guess that most people here on ATS have been affected by divorce directly or indirectly.Personally i was affected by this in 1992,since then and working with the public i know how common it is and the affects divorce and the laws surrounding it cause and are unevenly balanced in favor of the female through assets and custody of the child/ren.I have known many close friends(male)that have lost everything they had and worked for only to lose it to some other guy his wife so chooses,one guy i know had to divide his asset's (house,business that only he ran)to his ex because she turned lesbian with her best friend,she still got the Kids,tho he did get to have them every other weekend.(how nice)In Australia there are approx 1.3 million children who live apart from there natural parents,well thats what happens when two people divorce but why then do women 90% of the time get the custody of the child/ren reducing the fathers role to an ATM card with little to no say in the up bringing of his children?5 fathers suicide in Australia everyday which is said to be higher than the nation road toll,not taking into account that some fathers suicide through the use of their cars.Yet nearly every ad break on TV you`ll see them spouting off about why and what a great job speed cameras do,and never have the statistics come out in the media about the suicides of dads who have lost everything and can see no other choice.A site called ""dads on the air""here in Australia has done a lot for fathers,they are a radio station and they have a forum,when i used to read there many years ago a post came in that i just noticed and read it,it was a last goodbye suicide post he said sorry he`s not a fighter and cant see any way to get on with his life now that he is financially crippled by the C$$A(child support agency)the admin of that site was able with the help of police track him down as was found just alive, he had over dosed on some type of pills and took him to hospital.A big thumbs up to their admin.Chances are you as male has or will go through this and experience it first hand,not only that but if and when you can get back on your feet you may find another lovely lady like i did tho she can be penalized by the same laws that affect you.In the UK there are some guys that dress up as batman or spiderman?type things and climb up buildings with there message about the plight of fathers just to get people aware because the media does`nt.The media dont hold back in their support of women tho.The same unbalance i know exists in the US and Newzealand.It could i guess be seen by some that i`m against women, not at all,i`d be the first to help or protect them,thats in mens nature to be that way,well most i`d say,tho this is the very reason why men allow these things to happen.There has been a huge ad campaign running in Australia about domestic violence against women will not be tolerated,obviously it should be no domestic violence will be tolerated because........some studies show that it is equal to or greater that violence towards men is by women.Most men would`nt report it,i think thats the difference.Let alone the times around the world that some mothers kill their children and get off the charges.Though they are still to be considered the primary carers over males and male are the providers.(is`nt that what women rights groups fight against?)There are feminazi groups (i like to call them)and sites around the world that i wont search and link for i`ve read them before and i`m sure they would come close to breaching ATS`s censors though their hate of men.If any fathers are in crisis here in Australia there are a number of org to help you.""Dads on the air""has a lot more linksApologies if i`m not totally up to speed on it all, its been along time since i looked into it more deeply,tho it still exists.I believe its order out of chaos and what better chaos could be caused than to start it within the family unit.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He was a Jew himself and infact, the Bible claims that all who are followers of Jesus are also Jews who are grafted in (Galatians 3:29). So whatever tradition he subscribed to, that is what we follow. The cannon of the Old Testament was well established by the Jews in his day, as the last book in them was written nearly 400 years before Jesus came.As for the New Testament, the books were all written by people who were with Jesus in some form or another. The persecution of Diocletian (302 AD) was the tipping point for deciding definitively which books were divinely inspired. This is not a difficult task for men who have committed themselves to the task. You have a large volume of confirmed work in the Old Testament to pull from and any book that contains information to the contrary of the previous work is considered non-scriptural. Also, please take into account that there are very few modern apologists or writers who spent the amount of time in scripture that men in those day did. Entertainment was not as prolific as it is today. The fixing of the new Testament canon was finalized mainly at the council at Carthage in 387 A.D., although the evidence points to the selection of the books as early as about the year 100 A.D.As for the Roman Catholic Church, you need to understand the actual difference between the Catholic and Protestant versions of Christianity. We protestants consider the Catholic Church to be the Antichrist power spoken of as coming in scripture. en.wikipedia.org... (Christianity)2. If faith in God guides you to believe in the bible, have you ever asked yourself why you connect the two? Why does your faith mean you have to believe a collection of literature chosen by a totalitarian theocracy?Again, see my reference to our beliefs about the Catholic Church. They themselves place scripture on a subordinate level to tradition.Their arguments are interesting, but ultimately mute as the Apostles who physically walked with Jesus were still alive when Timothy was being taught and heard the truth directly from the mouth of Jesus himself.The real reason for my faith is the accuracy of their prophetic teachings (referenced at end of first question). And archeological evidence in favor of this view of history. www.wyattmuseum.com... (this source is well known and extremely controversial which is why I chose it, as anything mainstream deserves extreme scrutiny).This as well as scientific inquiry.For this, please visit www.youtube.com... - Under playlists, you will see one section called the Genesis Conflict by a research professor who was a previous evolutionist turned Christian based on scientific evidence for a flood.3. Some books in the bible reference each other. What about the ones that don't? Why even consider them holy in the first place?In this regard, you have to consider the source of the material. Many of the New Testament books were written by the Apostles themselves (Paul included in this) who met and knew Jesus personally. The remainder were people who were close to him. If you can't hear it from the horses mouth, an eye witness is the next best thing.4. There are many correct and accurate predictions made by prophets in the bible. This is often used as ""proof"" of it being God's word. Why aren't the accurate predictions made by other religions, pagans, and atheists considered holy?I have only studied the Koran in any depth outside of the Bible, but would like to know the predictions you reference.5. Why are you convinced that it is unChristian to question the validity of scripture? Especially since you have no idea which books are really ""God's word""?Again, I think I have answered why they are considered God's Word, but I don't consider it un-Christian. In fact, the Bible requires that we do the opposite (I Thessalonians 5:21).6. If you admit that it is, indeed, man that decided on what you should be reading regarding God, do you believe that they are all inspired by God? If so... what scriptual evidence to you have that says contemporary religious leaders are inspired by God? In fact, the bible says the opposite and to beware those who will decieve.Again, we are talking about the Apostles who walked with Jesus and his inner circle. As for contemporary, be wary, you never know what you will get with those guys.Exactly right on your last point, Matthew 24 says there will be deception in the last days. :-)",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My question is why didn't mammals or other creatures with hemoglobin, evolve like plants? Why hemoglobin?



Why not chlorophyll? It would of been so easy for everything to have chlorophyll? What are the benefits of having hemoglobin (iron) than chlorophyll (magnesium)?



Do plants and animals/insects have anything in common with plants?



Are plants more complex than animals?



I'd like some good thought out answers please. Do we have and bio chemists, biologists, geneticists majors here?

While chlorophylls role is certainly acknowledged, and being a vegetarian, I am all for plants as well. However believe it or not, most of the planets photosynthesis is not performed by plants, rather it's performed by photosynthetic microorganisms, so give it up for pond scum!!I am not sure that I can answer this question the way you would like, but I do have some interesting info. Hemoglobin is not just a molecule present in higher organisms with blood. The porphyrin synthesis pathways are present throughout many phyla. Plants actually possess hemoglobin as do certain yeasts and other fungi. While not my personal belief, it would probably be stated that the endosymbiotic event that endowed progenitor photosynthetic organisms with a chloroplast occured after the endosymbiotic that endowed progenitor non-photosynthetic organisms and photosynthetic organisms with mitochondria. However, most evolutionary theory relies on primary producers evolving first.Again, it's not necessarily an issue or either or, but why not both. Certainly photosynthesis endows organisms with a great ability, creation of one's own food. While I've not done the calculations, perhaps it is not efficient enough to fuel a warm blooded organism such as yourself. I've not done the calculation here either, but I would imagine that the surface to volume ratio of most photosynthetic organisms is higher than that of non-photosynthetic organisms... multicellular organisms that is. Certainly motility and the ability to gather your own food also provide advantages. Perhaps in the presence of abundant vegetable material, motility becomes and advantage. For example if an area is saturated with vegetation, many resources are being used from the earth, and the competition for that pool of resources is intense. If an organism existed that could consume the vegetation, it would provide an advantage in that environment; it could eat plants rather than competing for scarce photosynthetic resources. Of course, we would be talking about this most likely on the level of a single cell. For a single cell endowed with both catabolic and anabolic pathways this is no great feat.Absolutely!! How long of a list do you want? Obviously cellular life, and all the structures, organelles and biomolecules that go along with it, many biochemical pathways, ie: glycolysis are universal, the one's that are not universal are generally represented multiple times, the genetic code is nearly universal, biosynthesis and degradation pathways are pretty much the same.This of course depends on what you mean by complex. Certainly animals have very complex organ and circulation systems. Myself, I would say that those are more complex than in plants, but I would bet there are many plant biologists that would love to string me up for it. However the process of photosynthesis, and the structure of the photosynthetic reaction center are some of the most amazing and complex structures I've ever 'seen.' They are amazing, absolutely and totally perfectly architecture at the Angstrom level. Of course mitochondria have similarly engineered electron transport pathways. But in my opinion the photosynthetic pathways are more complex than the catabolic pathways like glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation.Not sure if this is thought out enough for you... ask if you need clarification.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
323791,"The Van Allen Radiation belts were damaged in the 60's by the US Air Force. According to certain highly trusted sources, they damaged the Van Allen Radiation belts so much that a ""great hole"" was opened up, which has been continuing to grow ever since, along specific lines of magnetic force. Furthermore, it cannot be repaired. This will result in the entire collapse of the atmosphere and increasingly allow cosmic rays and cosmic dust to bombard the earth. It will also allow for increasing severe magnetic storms to penetrate to the surface of the earth along the gravitational vortex points, most noticeably off the coast of Florida in the Bermuda Triangle. (This can be seen as severe electrical storms and also massive heat waves, etc.) The hole will also allow for super-magnetic fields from the sun to penetrate to the surface of the earth causing widespread power failures - even at nuclear powered plants.There is no human means to repair the damage done to the Van Allen radiation belts! Eventually our biosphere/atmosphere will collapse and effectively leave all of humanity ""naked"" without this protective membrane. Furthermore, at that final hour of total biospherical failure, we will not be able to discern the difference between the atmosphere and the seas resulting in all those in the seas and oceans at that time perishing.Thought you or your readership might be interested to know the truth of the real cause of ""global warming"".Check out operation Argus and Fishbowl for more information on the nuclear bomb tests which destroyed our Van Allen Belts.---On the other hand, the ""Starfish"" H-bomb test, conducted by the USAir Force in July 1962 above Johnston Island west of Hawaii, injected high-energy electrons into the stable inner radiation belt, many of them lasting a year or two, some even longer. The intense artificial radiation belt from that blast disabled three satellites.Nuclear explosions in space were banned in 1967 by an international treaty, but nature itself sometimes steps in. On March 24, 1991 a strong interplanetary shock, originating on the Sun, hit the Earth's atmosphere, compressed it greatly and sent a secondary shock through its interior. Like surfers riding a wave, trapped electrons and ions rode this shock and within a minute or so created a new radiation belt just outside the inner belt (picture below). The new belt contained both electrons and protons of high energy (15-20 Mev), and it disabled the MARECS-I satellite and degraded GOES-7. The new (damaged) belt was observed by the US Air Force satellite CRRES and was still in place (somewhat weakened) when CRRES stopped transmitting at the end of 1991.

Regardless ive been white my whole life and it hasnt gotten me any of the lavish finer things that is belived by minoritys. Infact i think thats racist, and im tired of it. I see the developing culture as a perversion of reality what is strong like taking care of your family, going to work, being legitiment, not lieing, cheating, stealing is seen as weak. Methods of cowardice manipulation, blind selfishness ,and degradation of women is seen as strong. Having three babys mama's no father and the mentality that the white man is holding us down, is insantity it is a cop out it is weak. Do i not experince adversity? do i not experince racism? Should i then not triumph over adversity? should i lay down and use manipulation, and illegal power grabs to get what i want? Should i make those around me feel weak so i can feel strong? Granted there was a time, when African Americans did indeed experince institutional racism and slavery. There also was a time when my heritage and quite frankly all heritages experinced the same. Strife is not a personalized problem geard at a certain group but rather a obstacle shaping and molding humanity to become stronger and idealy closer together. You see we do have a common enemy, but it dosen't exist outside in some foreign culture or land it exists inside each and everyone of us.

Well, I probably should have thought about the presentation more. Also I could have done some checking around to see if anyone one else outside of ATS has done something along these lines. And worst of all, to me, I'm not confident I understand how many different waves of wrath and dying there are in the book of Revelation. I just read it all the way through in one sitting and added up each case where I felt like a third of everyone dies. When done the total was nine.I did try to double check it. The book is long, and reading it through to the end in one sitting is challenging. During the second proof reading all my feelings were full of doubt. Like ""why did I count a third of all trees being burnt up along with all the grass as a kill for man kind?"" I guess I was feeling some kind of symbolic interpretation, like the trees are large institutions of man, and all the grass are small ones.After the second reading, I was doubtful, about my conclusions. So I put that in the title. My original thought was to reverse engineer the book as a pure math riddle. Work the population of 144,000 backwards and see what population would be required. I was expecting about two or three ""kills"". When I got nine and the result was greater than the current world pop, I quickly scrambled to find a site that could project future populations. When late 2012 came back as the answer I decided to post it to the ATS 2012 forums.Also I should have taken better notes of where I felt the ""kills"" happened.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi Love:The Mayan's do not know how long, because the magnetic north pole is repelled to tip Earth backwards, while the dwarf star passes by; like a spinning top knocked out of kilter. The Earth will bow away from the star and continue spinning, but the southern hemisphere is drawn near the Sun and the dwarf star to suffer the worst of the solar storms; while the northern hemisphere experiences one long night under the magneto dome created by the magnetosphere bent backwards like spaghetti. The geological pole shift starting around the second conjunction on Sept. 26 is the reaction of the dwarf star assuming polarity control of our planet in a process that has already started and has been ongoing since 2004. The birth pangs are becoming more pronounced from heating up of the Earth magma causing caverns from deep inside the earth to sing song on the surface.Solar flares/storms will continue to become worse from gravitational interaction between the Sun and the dwarf star coming in for a single pass at Mercury orbit to begin the cycle all over again. Unfortunately for Earth and the people, the summer perigee orbit means our planet is on the wrong side of the Sun and the dwarf star passes 21 million miles away exiting the inner solar system and the benefit of any trailing debris. If this dwarf star came six months earlier or later, Earth would be 1.396 AU at our nearest point and the pole shift is eliminated from the equation. The Elites and their liars have known this thing was coming for a long time, which is why dwarf star perigee is 9/11/2011 exactly 10 years after the 9/11 Inside Job. The House of Rothschild and Rockefeller and their banster cartel pals murdered JFK and third conjunction is November 22, 2011, so these guys can rub our noses in it. I have five emails from Leonid ELEnin that look to be written by some kid. His comment was that he might do a real live reporter interview some day...The dwarf star does not block the Sun and is not orbiting on the ecliptic plane to be directly between Sun and Earth, but the Sun and dwarf star are very large in mass compared to Earth as the small magnet in space getting pushed around by two giants. But hopefully my ELEnin = dwarf star hypothesis is wrong. I am hoping someone here has a better answer.I laughed so hard the travel trailer shook. ;0) BTW, I have written at CF.com and BibleDebateForum.com for years. Most people with an opinion think we are heading for the end of the age, when in reality the Day of the Lord is about to begin. Link . Start at the third paragraph and I explain to Dr. Bill Deagle about what is about to happen. This Earth is still far from the end of the age. Elijah comes to restore all things (Matt. 17:10-11) as the prophet of Acts 3:22-23 including the Tabernacle of David/Adam (Acts 15:16-18) and the kingdom to Israel. The kingdom lasts for a very long time and then Satan's people begin to incarnate and the Messiah (David/Adam) is cut off (62nd week) and then the antichrist shows up to set up his abomination of desolation. That is how the Day of the Lord 'ends,' but the Day of the Lord must start before it can end the age still far in the future.PXGuy",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Man Accidentally Shoots Himself and Wife in Church While Discussing Recent Church Shooting



Well to all the morons that think that guns everywhere is a great idea, here's a good example of why it's not.

First of all, God could have changed events and prevented the 'accidental' shooting from happening. If those who claim to be God fearing and believers in Jesus Christ depend on guns instead of depending on the Godhead, then they believe the gun and bullet come first before true Godhead intervention.It's like the supernatural made a statement, ""you showoff and pass around another goddamned gun in MY church again ye hypocrites and people of little faith..""No one is supposed to be shooting other people. The reason for this is because God's Angels are the only one's allowed to bear arms and use them and we are to call on them and wait for them. We are to take the bullet if it's God's will and God will either take us home or bring us back to life as a witness. Or God will divert the bullet.What they should have done as believers is held hands and called upon Jesus Christ and His Army of Angels to guard them. They passed a gun around instead and expected each other to surpass the skill of God's Army of Angels. None of God's Angels are going to 'accidentally' shoot anyone they protect.They are coming!

The tremors are again clustering there.....I expect to see another off-shore quake in the region soon. I am trying to stay away from predictions here, but really don't see this as one, but rather a tie-in to your hypothesis. You may not agree with me though, if I am interpreting you wrong.

I will try to give my answer to this but JV is the guy to ask. And it is pretty quiet now, so I will chime in. The 2011 M6.4 event occurred where the effective northern extremity of the Juan de Fuca plate goes under Vancouver Island as defined by the Nootka fault. This seems to be a repeating pattern with several quakes in the 2.0 to 5.0 range, followed by a M6 at this same point. If this is true (I only have looked at post 2000) then it clearly expresses the stress buildup where the northern margin of the plate passes under the thick exotic terrane of Wrangellia under central Vancouver Island. I don't think it is related to the tremor patterns except that the tremor patterns usually have died out before this part of Vancouver Island is reached. Here is a comparison of two of the central VI/plate boundary earthquake patterns. The one of the left is for 2000-2006 and ends with a M6.4 right up against the VI boundary. And of course the Sept. 2011 M6.4 is in almost the same exact place. So I doubt it means anything in regards to an upcoming megaquake.And to illustrate the extent of tremor under Vancouver Island (constrained by the sensing instruments) here is a tremor plot for 2005-2012:",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Speaking to reporters in Agen, southern France, Mrs. Mitterrand said that war over oil is well on the way to becoming a thing of the past, but that war over water is likely to break out in different parts of the world.



Mrs. Mitterrand is not the first person to raise a specter of war over water. It is the subject of hundreds of scholarly papers and conferences, as indeed it has been the worry of environmentalists over much of the past two decades. A former senior president of the World Bank predicted famously that the next World War will be over water.

The article goes on to mention that the scarcity of water in northern China is becoming a big issue for the Communist Party and there are plans on the drawing-board to re-direct rivers that flow through China towards India northward.I remember seeing this mentioned a couple years ago, but the impact on India and/or any other surrounding countries was never mentioned. I also haven't been able to find any information on whether this project has gotten off the drawing-board or if it was just a ""pipe dream"" as it were.How would India and the UN respond if China started diverting water headed towards India to northern China? I certainly hope China would give in to political pressure since they are dependent on the global marketplace and trade sanctions would hurt more than redirecting parts of the Yangtze would help.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

something unknown did crash in the waters of off Shag Harbor, Nova Scotia in October of 1967.

Chapter Summary

1. The Crash

that night

2. The Investigation

mysterious yellow foam



• 3-4 inch thick and “glittery” yellow foam stretching down the Sound for half a mile and 80 feet in width, also oily to the touch.

• Bubbles coming to the surface in areas

• Distinct Sulpher smell in crash area(apparently common in CE3+ cases?!)

all courtesy of roswellproof.com : Here are some official documents from the Canadian government on this WELL documented crash(



The Cameron family of Woods Harbour also filed a UFO report with the RCMP about 2 objects they had seen on the night of Oct. 11, one being very similar in appearance to the one seen crashing into Shag Harbour about half a mile to the south exactly exactly one week before. In addition, the Cameron story was an Oct. 12 front page article in the Halifax Chronicle-Herald , the story titled “2nd UFO Reported Seen In Shelburne.”







As noted in a previous section, the secret military search for the object at the submarine detection grid near Shelburne was suddenly called off one week after the crash when a Soviet submarine appeared in the vicinity and the flotilla sailed off to intercept. This seemingly was followed by the Cameron UFO sighting.







Lockland Cameron, his wife Lorraine, their daughter Louella, and Lockland's brother Havelock, his wife Brenda and their child, were watching TV when the picture suddenly developed interference. Lockland Cameron went to look for an airplane when he saw a group of six brilliant red lights in the in a straight line, about 3/4 mile away, tilted down at about 45 degrees, pointed in a SE direction, and perhaps 500-600 feet about the water. The entire family came over to watch. On four different occasions the lights flashed in a sequence, back and forth. The spread of the lights was 50-60 feet. The lights were stationary for 7 or 8 minutes, then briefly disappeared.

To start three of the top cases of the sixties decade we are immediately presented with nothing more than a couple UFO crashes as far as “top cases” go. Keep in mind that two ‘well known’ crash events happened in this decade; The Kecksburg Crash of December 1965 and of course this crash, while not as well known among the general public, actually leads to a better definite conclusion than Kecksburg. The fact of this case is this;Something, which unlike the very messy Kecksburg event, is still officially an “UNKNOWN” event. There as been no large scale and speculated ‘cover-up’ event on this case, not like the Roswell Crash or Kecksburg crash. This case is considered unknown by ALL parties involved, whether it be me, you, or the public opinion of official governments. Personally I love UFO crashes and am excited to re-hash this event, let us get started shall we?First off it is important to note and document the numerous UFO reports filed that night in the area, by plane, ship, and ground witnesses. It is apparenton the night of October 4th, 1967:The first map is a nice multi-spectrum map of witness sightings of UFOs. The second is a nice flow chart-type map utilizing direction and time of UFO reports to document the course of events that night.• 4 UFOs were sighted by the crew of the M.V. Dickerson, a dragger with 18 men onboard. The ship was off of Sambro, Nova Scotia and solid radar returns lasting for about two hours before disappearing 30 minutes prior to the crash.• Air Canada Flight 305 spotted UFO activity while going westbound between Sherbroke and St. Jean.Both the pilot and co-pilot filed official reports just hours before the Shag Harbor incident.At around 11:20 PM(Atlantic Daylight Time) on October 4th, 1967 it was reported by multiple witnesses thathad crashed into Shag Harbor. At least eleven witnesses reported to have seen something illuminated and low flying head towards the bay. Some witnesses reported a “whistling” sound, similar to what one hears in those old war movies when the bombs whistle before as they fall. Many witnesses also have reported that the object made an audible air disturbance as it descended, as well as a loud bang and a flash of light when it entered the water, about 300 meters from shore. The initial call to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) came from Laurie Wickens, who with four of his friends had witnessed an object crashing into the harbor while driving alongside the bay on Highway 3. Wickens stated that his friends and he went to a better vantage point to see exactly what they just saw. He stated that he saw an object floating in the water about 300 meters out and that that it appeared to have a yellow light on top of it, whatever “it” was.Thinking his friends and he had witnessed a small plane crash into the bay he alerted the RCMP. His call was disregarded by the RCMP until more calls flooded in from many other witnesses that saw the event. What could be gathered from the witness accounts were the following:[color=silver]• Craft appeared to be 60 feet long(20 meters)• Appeared to be positioned at a 45 degree angle in the sky before crashing• Initially had four or five flashing/glowing orange lights• Shape was never specified, probably because it was dark, only the outline of lights could be seen• Weather conditions were clear with good visibilityThe RCMP finally took the reports seriously and dispatched three units to the scene, believing that a small airplane had crashed. When the units arrived they also witnessed the “bobbing yellow light” in the water, being concerned for any passengers of the downed craft the RCMP called the Rescue Coordination Center (RCC) to alert them of the developing situation and inquire about any known missing aircraft. However the craft reportedly began to sink beneath the waves before anyone could get out to the site.However, it is important to note and document the numerous UFO reports filed that night in the area, by plane, ship, and ground witnesses. It is apparenton the night of October 4th, 1967:Bradford Shand and Lawrence Smith were the first people to arrive on the scene in their personal fishing boats. But when they got there the light was gone and all that was left on the surface was a. Here are some characteristics of the crash site:[color=silver]As we can clearly see this crash was heavily documented, in fact there are many documents not available to this day. I am sorry for the poor quality of the documents but they are what they are and should still be readable to most.There are some interesting reports concerning another object or objects being spotted and reported just prior to this crash event. Here is an excerpt about an October 11th sighting that appears to be characteristic of the same craft that crashed:[edit on 7/24/2009 by jkrog08]",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Since the lapdog media pushed the photo onto the public in sync, it was most likely the authorities that did so, in that case the entire trial should be thrown out due to an attempt to deceive the public into having a pre-conceived notion of evil for the defendant. Which is perhaps why the judge of the trial allowed the release of the second photo, the one perhaps less photoshopped, in a pathetic attempt at recalibrating the mind's view of the defendant. Either way the judge says his reasoning for releasing the second photo despite the defense's argument that it violates the defendants privacy rights was the second photo looked more ""tame"" so even the judge can see the amount of influence the first photo had.My first reaction was that the first photo shows he was on drugs. Maybe '___'. The goofy smile, the strange eyes, and the puffy face. He looks fried, if you know the expression. Plus if he was being mind controlled those drugs may have been part of the operation. Whether he was on drugs, or photoshopped, or either, the case by this point has lost all credibility, which is why when I asked to see the video surveillance tape so many people said ""but, but, it'll tamper with the trial."" Sorry, it has already been tampered with beyond recognition. This is why I am strangely attracted to this theory about TPTB replacing Loughner with a look-a-like, the reason being that it is a far fetched theory, however the facts do seem to indicate different ""Loughner's"" at each instance, and with the public foaming at the mouth for his execution, it would be just like TPTB to eliminate him while the public was still waiting for him to get sentenced.

Johnny and Lisa Bonta, a Native family from the Reno Sparks Indian Colony, became the latest victims of a hate crime on May 24 when they were attacked at a gas station along I-80 in Fernley, Nevada, a border town between the Fallon and Pyramid Lake Indian reservations.



“I was pumping gas at Quick Stop on our way to Reno to look for another job when these skinheads in a blue car drove by real slow and checked us out. The driver jumped out with a baseball bat, and I asked them ‘why you holding a bat?” said Bonta. “He said ‘let’s do this’ and tried to pick a fight. I don’t know how to explain what happened—we didn’t do anything to them.”





“They all jumped out of the car with baseball bats, knives and a crowbar, and we knew they were going to hurt us,” said Lisa Bonta, in an interview from Washoe Medical Center, where she was in treatment for seizures she suffers.



Lisa and her daughter, Alyssa, were terrified watching the brutal and bloody fight as her unarmed husband and son-in-law tried to fight off the three young men in their 20s.



“I saw one of them hit my husband in the head with a bat, and the other one was trying to cut off his braid with a knife. Johnny was covered in blood and they just kept hitting him with a crow bar. They even tried to slit his throat,” she added.





At first they said there was a bench warrant for an unpaid $$367 fine, and when we made arrangements to pay that, they charged him with battery with a deadly weapon, even though it was those boys who had the weapons. The booking papers say we owe $$30,367.00. ”

Gotta love hate crimes...but this one also includes the worse form of police brutally too...Trying to avoid the confrontation Bonta gets his family back in the car and off they drive... yup you guessed it, those skin heads were hot on their heels. before they could make it to the freeway on-ramp, and safety those skinheads cut Bonta off forcing him to crash into them...Now this fight broke out at 1pm just as people were returning from lunch, on the side of a very busy interstate mind you... No One... stopped to help...Lisa Bonta is outraged that their attackers were all released at the scene of the crime and were not charged despite the fact they bragged about it on Facebook on May 24, the day of the attack.Johnny Bonta, (Lisa's Husband) bleeding and barely standing after being hit in the knees with a bat, was arrested on the scene and taken to jail. He said he was not allowed medical treatment for six days while he was in the county jail, all the while uncertain about what charges had been filed against him.The Bontas said since this happened, at least four other Native families have told them they too were harassed and attacked by skinheads in nearby border towns. But people told her they don’t report the incidents because they don’t believe police will help them. These follow an April 2010 attack on Vincent Kee, Navajo, in Farmington, New Mexico, where three men took Kee from a McDonald’s and shaved a swastika symbol on the back of his head and branded him with the symbol using a coat hanger.Since the story broke supporters have started a petition at Change.org for the Governor of Nevada to address the situation along with other hate crimes in Nevada. A Facebook page was also created in support of the Bonta family. Justice for Johnny Bonta and Family",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I watched an hour long special report of this flood of illegals last night. Those coming over our borders, have no paperwork with them.

Those pouring over have been given instructions by the cartel coyotes, exactly what to say to get them here, and there ain't a damn thing we can do about it.The border patrol people I saw interviewed, said many many of those coming over, appear to be much older than 18, and have seen many sporting gang tattoos. But, the border patrol MUST follow the letter of the law, and let them all in on word alone.Obama set the course of this massive influx of illegals, when 13 months ago Obama stated his administration would not follow the law when it came to kids. That made it an open door policy to everyone. The coyotes are also handing very young kids to adults, telling them to claim they are their kids, then dump them once they get over the border.It's a mess out of control....it will take an army to stop this landslide...Des",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

330263,"Furthermore, I assume more people have not read the book 'The Biggest Secret"" yet, but here is a copy & pasted part of something better than a youtube video showing what could possibly be a reflection:



---> (from the book):

Two television

presenters had just such an experience while interviewing a man who was in favor of

the global centralization of power known as the New World Order. After the live

interview, the male presenter said to his colleague that he had experienced an amazing

sight during the interview. He had seen the man’s face transform into a lizard-like

creature and then return to human. His female fellow presenter was astounded because

she had seen the interviewee’s hands turn reptilian. The male presenter also told me of

an experience a policeman friend had while making a routine visit to an office block in

Aurora, near Denver, Colorado. The policeman had commented to an executive of one

of the companies on the ground floor of the extreme nature of security in the building.

She told him he should look at the higher floors if he wanted to know how extensive it

really was. She also pointed to a lift which only went to certain floors at the top of the

building and, as they chatted, she told him of something she had seen some weeks

earlier. The lift had opened and a very strange figure had emerged. He was white to the

point of being albino, but he had a face shaped like a lizard and his eye pupils were

vertical like a reptile’s. This lizard-like figure had walked out of the lift and into an

official-looking car waiting outside. The policeman was so intrigued that he used his

own time to check on the companies at the top of the building served by the mystery

lift. He found they were all fronts for the Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA.

Then there are the experiences of Cathy O’Brien, the mind controlled slave of the

United States government for more than 25 years, which she details in her astonishing

book, Trance Formation Of America, written with Mark Phillips. She was sexually

abused as a child and an adult by a stream of famous people named in her book. Among

them were the US Presidents, Gerald Ford, Bill Clinton and, most appallingly, George

Bush, a major player in the Brotherhood, as my books and others have long exposed. It

was Bush, a paedophile and serial killer, who regularly abused and raped Cathy’s

daughter, Kelly O’Brien, as a toddler before her mother’s courageous exposure of these

staggering events forced the authorities to remove Kelly from the mind control

programme known as Project Monarch. Cathy writes in Trance Formation Of America

of how George Bush was sitting in front of her in his office in Washington DC when he

opened a book at a page depicting “lizard-like aliens from a far off, deep space place.”

Bush then claimed to be an ‘alien’ himself and appeared, before her eyes, to transform ‘like a chameleon’ into a reptile. Cathy believed that some kind of hologram had been activated to achieve this and from her understanding at the time I can see why she rationalized her experience in this way. Anyone would, because the truth is too fantastic to comprehend until you see the build up of evidence. There’s no doubt that alien-based mind programmes are part of these mind control projects and that the whole UFOextraterrestrial scene is being massively manipulated, not least through Hollywood

films designed to mould public thinking. Cathy says in her book that George Lucas, the

producer of Star Wars, is an operative with NASA and the National Security Agency,

the ‘parent’ body of the CIA But given the evidence presented by so many other

people, I don’t believe that what Bush said and Cathy saw was just a mind control

programme. I think he was revealing the Biggest Secret, that a reptilian race from

another dimension has been controlling the planet for thousands of years.

Crazy?

Today’s mighty oak is just

yesterday’s nut that held its ground.

What you're saying is kinda the oldest cheap shot in the book... Saying both what do you have to hide and calling those who are worried paranoid shutins in one fell swoop. What do you have to hide? Everything... The current situation might not be one where political dissidents are hunted down in droves, but its scary if you consider both the proliferation of cameras (and the domestic use of drones will make this magnitudes worse) and the crazy information handling leaps over the past decade that allow this raw data to be collected and used (in wireless networking automatic facial recognition and processing the hits to show where people move, their habits and who they network with) that would leave the makings of a turnkey surveillance state with absolutely unprecedented capabilities to take out whoever the computers say are likely to be a threat by their activities and associations (and the nation-wide militarization of the police force and their increased use of assault tactics doesn't ease my worries in that regard). And I'm worried about civilian drones (at least the ones that are network connected beyond like a remote control) because what's to stop them from snooping the feeds from them too (although as I mention that and look at the camera on my phone I feel a little uneasy). So nothing's wrong with the idea of flying robots in my mind... However, having robots with cameras flying around everywhere transmitting the video they receive to networks which are both trivial to break into and are already shown to be the playground for electronic intelligence agencies and given the nation's history of handling dissidence or perceived dissidence by harrassment, false arrest, or outright assassination really concerns me",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Well if the volcano erupts and cause the western side of the island to slide in to the Atlantic it would generate a wave some where between 150 - 200ft high. The tsunami would then travel across the ocean at the speed of a jet airliner. It would take almost 8 hours for it to cross the Atlantic so at the very least we'd have plenty of warning. and for those of you who are wondering we do have a tsunami early warning system in the Atlantic. When the tsunami reaches shore it would destroy everything along the coast, and travel in land for hundreds of miles!Every State from Maine to Florida would be devastated! Florida would be hit the hardest since it highest point it only 30 ft or so, the tsunami would go right over the top of Florida washing everything in its path away.

From one grandmother to another... don't let statistics worry you. Dwelling on negative thoughts will only freak you out and lead to a miserable life of unnecessary fear. Turn back the clock to the days of your youth when we all felt like we were indestructible and wold live forever. Believe that you are immortal. Most of all, HAVE FUN, and learn to live each day as if it were your last.



When I lost my husband a few years ago I felt that my day was coming soon. Statistics say that a large number or surviving spouses succumb to death not long after they lose their soul mate, and in all my misery I began to believe that my time was quickly approaching. I was depressed, and dropped from 145 lbs to 85 lbs in a matter of weeks. In essence, I was caught up in a destructive self fulfilling prophecy.



One day a very dear friend confronted me with her fears for my health, and reminded me of my long standing beliefs that statistics are meant to be beat, that my husband most admired my positive spirit and I should adopt a more positive life in his honor, and that I needed to enjoy life to its fullest and live each and every day as if it were my last. That day of self reflection was pivotal in my recovery, and a everlasting reminder of how important maintaining a positive outlook on life is to our existence.



Since then I've re-learned how to have fun. I've taken time to travel and explore the endless beauty of this world. Europe, Africa, the far east, Alaska, Tahiti, and all 50 US states have been mine to discover. Be unpredictable. One of my most exciting trips was totally unplanned. Friday after work I drove from the office to the airport, picked a destination from the list of departing flights, and went on a weekend adventure with only the clothes on my back. Yes it can get expensive, but its really refreshing to laugh out loud and say ""yeah, its crazy, but I DID THAT!""



During your down time, adopt a hobby that would blow peoples minds. I took up online gaming... first person shooters and MMO's to be more specific. Playing first person shooters (Call of Duty and Battlefield series games) helped to hone my reflexes, and gave me the opportunity to interact with many groups I would never have known otherwise. It was a blast! I then started playing a MMO game with a friend, formed a guild, built it up, and ended up capturing a main city in the weekly castle siege. (Captured in October, and its still mine)



If gaming doesn't appeal to you, consider furthering your education into a occupational field totally different from your own. I'm an MD by profession, but for several years I maintained my series 7 and series 63, (only lapsed due to broker/dealer sponsorship issues) I've gotten several computer hardware and networking certifications, and have learned airbrushing, massage therapy and acrylic/gel/solar nail design.



Above all, spend quality time with your loved ones.



While many may joke that I may have lost my mind in pursuing all that I have, I can likewise be absolutely proud of all that I've achieved in so many diverse ways. Will I live to see my next grandbaby? Probably, but if I don't, I'll certainly have left a legacy for everyone to remember me by.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

thanks but i have already seen that video from the ufo hunters. they did demonstrate that these objects that appear to be passing behind the tether and the strange critter shape they have could be an illusion.



what the video in the Op shows is...no matter if these objects went behind the tether or not, they are making delta V shaped maneuvers and at one point in the video you will see one of the objects stop ! and then do a 180 degree turn in direction.



that is what needs to be explained



I think it has been explained hundreds of times, the Shuttle thrusters can fire from more than one direction. Say some ice debris breaks of from the cargo bay and floats out into space and into FOV.

But to become a superpower, it obviously must eliminate and weaken other countries, that makes sense, right?it is also public knowledge that over recent years china has been growing more and more powerful, therefore a greater threat to current superpower, the U.S., that much is obvious. so what is the U.S. going to do about it? let china just take over? china has much greater population, a big advantage. will U.S. just sit and watch as they become dominated by China? no, obviously something must be done.thus you have it, their attempt to split china apart. divide and conquer. first Taiwan, then Tibet. and before that, too.

202015,"Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable. -Leviticus 18:22



Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error. -Romans 1:26-27



“It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law,” Jesus replied. “But at the beginning of creation God ‘made them male and female.' ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.’So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.” -Mark 10:5-9



But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.” -Revelation 21:8



Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. -1 Corinthians 6:9-10



for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers—and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine that conforms to the gospel concerning the glory of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me. -1 Timothy 1:10-11



Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.-Revelation 22:15



I don't know why people argue of the homosexuality issue. The Bible clearly condemns homosexuality as a sin. Christ even said God made man and woman and should be brought together.



Christ said it will be like the days of Noah (Matthew 24:38) which was full of ungodliness and debauchery before he returns. Dear friends we are living in the End Times.

Ya know what smart guy,, Quit talking about all the damn labor pains and SHOW ME THE BABY!

I liken the debate to a jigsaw puzzle that does not have its picture on the box.

Science is trying to put it together, while religious dogma is looking over his shoulder.

Dogma feels strongly that the resulting picture will be a unicorn, while Science has speculated a hypothesis based on viewing the individual pieces that the picture is of a bear.

The more Science puts it together, the more the puzzle begins to look like a bear.

Dogma begins to get more and more upset. ""I don't know why you're bothering, it's obviously a unicorn!"" he chortles.

Science shrugs, and continues assembling the pieces. The picture begins to look even more like a bear, until it's almost unmistakable.

Every once in a while, Science will have to correct an error and move a piece. Religion shrieks with glee at this. ""See?! You put that piece in the wrong place! Your wishful thinking that it's a bear made you make a mistake! Since you're wrong, I am therefore right, and the picture is of a unicorn!""



""But what about all the other pieces I did get right? Can't you see by the rest of them it's obviously a bear?"" replies Science.

""You just don't want to admit it's a unicorn! Your arrogance is getting in the way!"" screams Dogma lividly.

Science just shrugs, and continues with the puzzle.

266470,"Keyless Encryption



Keyless encryption is the long sought after code of many computer programmers. As far as I know, they haven't achieved it yet, but it is possible. It's not truly keyless, because YOU are the key to the encryption. The key is everything about you. Literally EVERYTHING about yourself. The colour of your hair, eyes, and skin tone. Your weight, height, hobbies, interests, people you know, places you've been, places you want to go, things you want to do, your friends, family, love interest, past lovers. Does something remind you of something? What is in the memory that pops up?





Chaining



The Cheat Code of Reality is so complex, that even the codes are coded. Let's take ""Red"" for example. Red means fire, and fire means wisdom. Wisdom means green and green means go. See how it chains? We started with Red and ended up with Green eventually. At some point, all code interconnects to every other code, so you can now see how ""everything is one.""





Duck and Cover



This one can be a real brain fryer. What this is is embedding messages in text or speech in a way that it can't be proven or disproven no matter how you look at it. What does a duck do? It quacks. A quack is a type of speech or communication, and ""Cover"" is the cover you use to hide the message. Using the ""Duck and Cover"" method, you can quite literally say anything you want without fear of being discovered. I'm going to use the intro to this text as an example of ""Duck and Cover"".



""Welcome, Seeker. I've been expecting you. You've been very confused and wandering aimlessly trying to figure things out, haven't you? You've been noticing patterns, following them, and they've led you here. You've been seeing and hearing messages embedded in what looks like normal speech and text everywhere you go. My reputation precedes me, lol. Well, you're in luck! You've stumbled upon my code, and you're not alone! No, you're not crazy. In fact, you're more than sane. You are now in a higher density of reality, and nobody can hurt you but yourself. Hopefully you can use this as a guide in your travels. This is what you'd call an ""Alchemic Text"".



Do you see the messages embedded in there? The ""Cover"" is the subject of The Cheat Code of Reality. The messages in there are me trying to let you know that everything is OK. The first message is ""You're in luck!” the next message is ""And you're not alone."", next is ""You're more than sane"", and next up is ""And nobody can hurt you but yourself"".





Body language



There have been entire books written on this alone, so I'm going to try and keep this one short and simple. The human body can display certain letters, numbers, and even shapes depending on how it is positioned or bent, including the arms, and legs. There are also hand signs that have meaning. One example is the hand signs commonly seen at rock concerts, ""Throwing up the horns"". Horns represent wisdom. We've all seen the ""Peace"" sign and ""Thumbs up"" as well.



It also goes deeper than that. Have you been thinking a thought and suddenly you, or someone you see, scratches their nose? That could mean that what you're thinking is correct or ""on the nose"". Maybe someone has an itch on their ear. That could mean ""listen"". Maybe an eye itches and you rub it, or someone else is rubbing their eye. That could mean ""Watch"" or ""See"".



Another code are nods. Nodding yes and no. Not only can you see nodding in people, but also in objects and plants. Do you see an object nodding up and down or to the side? When the wind blows, do the grass and trees move back and forth in a ""Nod""? Nodding is also a commonly inverted code.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

301135,"I just wrote an essay for this thread... when my PC crashed and I lost it all.... I'll try to re-iterate with the original sentiment.



The OP has good intent, I believe. The concerns raised are not due to the fact he/she doesn't want to pay taxes, but as Sherlock stated, the misappropriation of those taxes which all seem to 'trickle up'.



The tax system should be in place to improve NHS facilities and medical staff training, to better equip schools to teach practical, real-world skills to the youth, and for the general betterment of social housing, transportation, waste management and welfare, where it's genuinely needed. Instead our taxes are used to fund 2 (+) illegal wars and the Trident Nuclear 'deterrent' system.



You can write to your MP all you like they don't give a damn about you. You can't ensure their retiremtn is more than comfortable. Corporate elitists, with enough legislative change to ensure they stay rich, can.

We have an elite who accuse us of being 'addicted to borrowing' because the financial sector made some bad decisions and, most, should have been bankrupted.



They are also aware that interest, on both printed monies (paper and ink - yes, it grows on trees!) and on loans which consist of 90% made up numbers which were never printed, could never be paid back. So, to ensure all the money circulates at the top echelons of society they will take as much as they can at every opportunity, redistributing only where it is guaranteed to come back up.



But the problem doesn't end with ousting our government. The problem of mis-schooling, the false creation of enemies through religion and the stifling of medical advancement are the major concerns I have for my childrens future - not mine, I gave up on that a long time ago, but will fight, to the death, for theirs.



In medicine, whenever a true cure is found it is replaced by a supressant which allows for greater profitability over time. This has been seen time and time again where funding is stripped for genuinelife saving research in order to halt the progress of wonder drugs. All things in nature can be balanced. Except, apparenlty, our finances. After all, we need to make sure GSK, Baxter and the other huge Pharma's - and charities - don't miss out on their share of British £billions this year.



In education we do not teach real world skills anymore. The lies surrounding sciences and history to show the 'victors' or 'heroes' as those who promoted the ideals of an elite society (why is Tim Flowersnot a recognised hero... look up the origin of the apple logo), the debate surrounding religious, economic and military morals and ethics only serves to further dilute the pot, leaving more questions than answers which unlike promoting the kind of critical thinking any sociology major would claim to exude, only perpetuates the myth that we really need 'something' to rely on, because we're all far too stupid to remove profit from the equation and work things out based on resources... right?. And they need this to ensure we quietly comply with their immoral taxation and distribution of wealth. We do not.



Finally, don't be fooled into thinking that whats happening in the ME isn't a direct intervention of our governments (what the media refer to as 'western') in order to democracise these places in the fashion we have become accustomed to. It's much easier to lie to and steal from people who believe they have had a part in the 'selection process' of their 'leaders'.



Only when you see the big picture for what it truly is can you begin to imagine what the world could be like without the need for parliament, and false leadership, corporate dominance and capital slaying of true democracy. I still have hope that the youth are waking up. I have faith in mankind and when needed you can call on me.

Unless you have been living in a hole in the ground for a while, (pun intended), then you can't have helped but see that the Saddam Hussein and certain others are due to appear in court to hear the faces they will be charged with.



I have heard that the defence may rely on the point of the invasion of Iraq being illegal and therefore any charges brought should be invalid.



This may or may not be fact but I would like to pose the questions:



1) If Saddam Hussein is acquitted how will the US deal with this?



and



2) Does the pressure on the Iraqi government to find this man guilty determine the outcome of such a trial?



Many lives have been, and still are being lost in the attempt to bring stability and democracy to this country. After so costly an effort I don't believe the US could or would find an acquittal by the court acceptable.



How then might they react? The choices would be very restricted. This is a government only recently place into power and then mainly by the US. An unpopular decision reguarding the outcome of Saddam Husseins trial surely cannot lead to the US deposing the newly appointed government. After all, even the initial invasion was, at best, coldly recieved by many nations. Any such further action would then be unthinkable.



In reguards to my second question, then if so and the opportunity of a fair trial does not exist this attempt becomes no more than a farce, making a mockery out of the civilized worlds legal system.



Even then though, if this is the case, what other option is their left open?



(PS: I am in no way trying to defend this man. It is my personal opinion that the world should have accepted it's responsibilities, and he should have been removed from power, many years ago. Instead the western world happily continued dealing with him, supporting his reigeme even to the extent of arms sales. The only justification given for this is that of political strategy, 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend'. A decision which has returned to haunt us leaving a very bitter taste.)

autowrench, i kinda get your perspective on this. i cannot truthfully say that i understand it, but i get the general idea of it, and honestly - i pity humanity, for the mess which they have caused. i have been part of it in the past, and so i ask God for advice on my every move and action, so that they may be good; rather than what i think is right, i go with what i know is good. if you wish for me to clear up anything that you have heard, and that you think is false, i will do my best to tell you the truth on whatever you ask. for that which people have done and said to you, as well as thought about you - i am deeply sorry. not that i can make up for any of their actions, but that i can at least share with you what knowledge i possess. i hold no faith in christianity, but in God, the Christ, and the Bible. christianity is not of God, it is of man, and it will fail.

Thank you. I think. I hold no faith in Christianity either, to me it was designed, like other ""book religions,"" as a control factor over an ignorant people. Well, Humanity is not longer ignorant, or at least I wish it were not. We are supposed to be waking up from our sleep, and preparing to Ascend to a Higher Plane, but many of us still cling to outdated and false information based on older myths and stories. I strongly believe that Jesus worship is wholly designed to garner energy from a given collection point. (Church Building, usually with a Steeple for focusing the energy) Who gets this energy, and what it is used for I do not know, but I fear it is a malevolent thing not worth of our worship.I was raised up in a Church of God, Holy Roller style church. Being a reader, and a thinking man, there came a time when I had some questions for the preacher, who patted my head and told me to ""go home and read my Bible, for all answers are within."" Well, I did read it, many times in fact, and studied it, and looked up root words, and researched out stories found in there. I also studied deep into the so called ""occult,"" reading everything I could get my hands on, attempting to understand what was really going on. I discovered that even the occult teachings are filled with religious dogma and petitions. I discovered that King Solomon, and Moses were both High Egyptian Magick practitioners, and Solomon was in fact deep into Demonology, even the Historian Josephus made mention of them.

Considering the fact that only an insider would have the knowledge of who the agent was, it is clear that some lowlife in the Bush admin (probably in revenge against her husband) purposely leaked her name out to these reporters. For some reason news outlets thought it right to publicize the identity of a secret agent as well, but regardless... a law was broken in the outing of this person.



Holding back concrete evidence in this case, citing some sort of ""I'm a reporter so I'm above your petty justice system"" is an argument that the Supreme Court has snubbed its nose at.

We've all heard about it, we've all discussed it but whats the point to a false flagged alien invasion ?





For starters, theres far too much historical records from ancient times of UFO activity. Whether it be 'lights descending from the heavens and giving technologies' or when Alexander The Great was attacked by 'flying shields'. Are you going to tell me that the Nazi's or the shadow government traveled back in time just to annoy Alexander The Great in the middle of WWII?



Why was it that in terms of time one day we were cave men that might have some slight convocation over grunts to a civilization. Something happened to us that taught us all that stuff otherwise theoretically dinosaurs should have been smarter than us. Certain species of dinosaurs were on the Earth for a lot longer than homo-sapiens. To me that is indicating the possibility of 'divine-intervention' of some sorts.





Another thing that I think discredits the argument of a false flag operation is that its only been since really 9/11 that false flag allegations have come to light. Only since then have the people, more precisely the American people, started to really mistrust their government. I mean now days if Bush got a puppy you'd be screaming ""That dogs a robot that shoots lasers from its eyes to protect him from terrorists"". Which is rather absurd. People can make conspiracies about everything so I think false flagging is a hoax.



Perhaps false flagging is a false flag in itself, told to people of power that might/would tell someone which is how we get information or in this case disinformation. You'd be surprised what someone with a little power can say and the world believes them. example being that time in the 50s or 60s when that radio station said aliens invaded Washington and there was a nation-wide panic.

which polls? show what you tell us



People had mixed views on cross-strait relations last year. About 30% of the people believe cross-strait relations in 2001 were more or less the same as in previous years.

A quarter of respondents said relations improved in 2001, with the same percentage saying relations worsened.

Regarding the situation in which PRC Foreign Minister Tang Jianxuan showed a bullying attitude to Taipei representatives at APEC Shanghai meetings in October, 68% believe that this could have a negative impact on future cross-strait relations.

Asked about their forecasts for future relations between the two sides, 47% responded that things would be more or less the same, and 52% said there would be no major improvement.

Moreover, 53% of the people hoped the government could send more friendly signals and take initiative in improving cross-strait relations.



Those in favor of “maintaining the status quo and leading toward independence in the future” represent about 10%.

Those at the extreme ends seeking quick unification or immediate independence belong to the smallest groups, with less than 10% support respectively.





All opinion polls conducted in Taiwan show that 80% of the population favors maintenance of the status quo in cross-Strait relations.



After the October 10 speech by president Chen in 2004, support for independence reached new heights.

Polls suggest that nearly 30% of Taiwanese residents now support independence, and an even higher percentage would support the construction of a Republic of Taiwan in 2008, as the final step after the proposed constitutional revisions in 2006.

Support for One Country, Two Systems, the proposed solution by the PRC, is between 5-7%.

The majority (just below 60%) still support the status quo, which is to leave Taiwan's status exactly the way that it is and to leave the issue of whether to become independent or reunify for a future date.



Taiwan leader Chen Shui-bian had intended to reap the biggest gains from the polls.



His hopes, however, were shattered by the election results.



Before the election, Chen's pan-green camp of ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Taiwan Solidarity Union strived to to increase its influence in the 225-seat ""parliament"" and even wrest an absolute majority.



Chen had repeatedly promised to use control of the ""Legislative Yuan"" to facilitate his pro-independence push.



Since Chen rose to power in May 2000 and was re-elected in March, he has done nothing to improve cross-Straits ties because of his pro-independence stance.



However, Chen's camp was defeated by the opposition coalition of Kuomintang (KMT), People First Party and New Party in the ""legislative"" elections.



Li Jiaquan, a senior researcher with the Institute of Taiwan Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, says Saturday's poll results fully demonstrated the unpopularity of Chen's policy.



what conditioning are you talking about? can you prove what you claim?



Chen's comments were his toughest since taking office in May 2000. At the end of Saturday's speech, Reuters reported that the Taiwan leader stood and punched his right hand in the air as the master of ceremonies shouted, ""Taiwan stands up!"" and ""Taiwan walks its own path!""



The tone of his speech was similar to a statement made by former President Lee Teng-hui, who said in July 1999 that Taiwan and China have a ""special state-to-state"" relationship.



Lee's words angered China, which in turn accused the president of taking Taiwan on a reckless path towards independence.





Bush Opposes Taiwan Independence

Tuesday, December 09, 2003



WASHINGTON — Tuesday was not Taiwan's day at the White House, as President Bush announced that the U.S. had asked the island republic to cancel a referendum American officials feel would be provocative toward Beijing.



""The United States policy is one China (search),"" Bush said after a 40-minute Oval Office meeting with mainland Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao (search).



""We oppose any unilateral decision by either China or Taiwan to change the status quo,"" Bush told reporters, ""and the comments and actions made by the leader of Taiwan"" — referring to President Chen Shui-bian (search) — ""indicate that he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally.""

All black and silver suit and black helmet almost like a power ranger. You can hear my reaction to this visual stimuli as Oh my, did you see that at 50 odd seconds in? Jesus dude. You can see a tentacle in the video at this time but I was not reacting to the tentacle which was unseen to me.I also saw sanscrit like symbols neon highlight colored, splayed upon the walls above the tub and taking up my complete field of vision, they were taking up the space not occupied by the short dolls. They almost looked like sanscrit or hieroglyphs. It is at the 37 second or so mark when a tentacle first enters the camera frame at the right and bottom side of the frame. This is when I saw what I still have difficulty describing. I did not see the tentacle until reviewing footage.I was in a 5x6 foot bathroom and in the video I am panning left and right. From the threshold of the bathroom entrance to the tub and toilet. At no point did I face the bathroom door entrance which is where the tentacle appeared to come from.I was having trouble sleeping and frequent lucid dreams which I had always enjoyed. It got to a point last summer where I was worrying about my lucidity in real life. This started in early june 2013. So I used digital camera to start recording the nights when I was alone. There was nothing eventful that showed up on the recorded videos, that matched what I saw.I was disappointed the sanscrit highlight language and the symbols and colors didn't show. Instead I realized there was a tentacle in the camera frame while I was witnessing these things. I never saw tentacle in real time.After video cuts out I continued to see some pretty crazy stuff. I tell myself it was just in my head but it all started the moment the tentacle entered the frame. The visuals I saw and beings I saw. When I left bathroom I called my dad on phone frantically telling him there was someone with big blue eyes in my bedroom.I could see it in doorcrack and it makes me want to cry when I think of it. When I try to remember what the being in the bedroom looked like specifically. It was a little shorter than me but not as small as the dozen doll sized beings I saw in bathroom. I don't know why. I ran out of my home at sunrise when I finally broke out of the state I was in.I saw a blue angel coming across the lake towards me almost as if in the cloud. Flying.

Unless the aliens are galactic humanitarians, I can't see any good coming out of an attack.



Realistically if a Type II Civilization on the Kardashev scale decided to launch a total full scale assault on the Earth, we wouldnt have a chance to fight back. Within the first hours all communications and power would be cut across the planet. No one would even know what the heck was going on. There would be mass panic and confusion. It would look like New Orleans after Katrina on a global scale. The Power a Type II Civilization would unleash would seem godlike or more like Natural disasters. Most followers of the Abrahamic faiths would be convinced it was the end of the world. Other than that most of humanity would have no idea what was happening. By the time a human even came face to face with an invader, every government and economy would of collapsed. Human civilization would be gone. What would be left would resemble Somalia or Afghanistan. The human ""resistance"" would be no more of a resistance than Army Ants are to contractors clearing the Amazon.



On the other hand, maybe its not a full scale assault. Maybe its a raid. Maybe the Aliens are the interstellar equivalent of Vikings, Pirates, or Barbarians. They are here to sack and pillage. Then they leave as quickly as they came. This is one of the scariest and to me the most likely, if it ever happens. (Who knows it may have already happened before)



In the event of a Alien Raid, it would be quick and terrify the crap out of people. Imagine 9/11 on a global scale. Again no one would have any idea what was happening. People would probably not figure out what happened until it was over. Im willing to bet some people may not admit it happened, blaming people for it or it is covered up by various governments. In the chance it does become public, it will not be pretty.



The world may unite against the Raider Threat, but it will be at the cost of freedom, liberty, privacy, and democracy.

When humanity itself becomes a Type II Civilization and manages to avoid causing our own extinction or technological collapse, we will then have a chance at fighting back against a Type II Civ.

I have come to the conclusion that Homeowner’s Associations are one of the most evil institutes in America. The reason I posted this in General Conspiracies is because it is one, probably the largest, non-talked about conspiracy in this country. In different states, there is documented proof of collusion between HOA Boards, management companies, lawyers, and judges to profit on the foreclosure of homes in covenanted communities. The worst states, currently, are California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida.



If you have never been involved in a HOA dispute, you might not realize what you have given away if you live in a covenanted community. Because you have signed a legal contract with a corporation (usually non-profit), you have signed away all of your constitutionally protected property rights, as any dispute is now a contract dispute. If you live in one of these communities, you are living in a private government with no checks and balances. Most homeowners are not aware that they are one Board election away from disaster; you are truly living in a politically unstable country!

HOAs are Fascist Totalitarian Terrorist Fiefdoms. You are completely right.I was recently in a dispute with the board of one.I purchased a property xx years ago. Last yeartheir inspector claimed a certain decorative feature was illegaland I was responsible for violating the bylaws by installing it.That decorative feature was on the property when it was purchased.I did not install it and they were informed of that fact which they ignored.The boards inspector viewed the property and issued a permit for the salebut that decorative feature was not mentioned because at that time nobodyon the board cared about it. So it was permitted and grandfathered inas far as I know by law.Ten years later they tell me to remove it, after arguing with them and seeingthere was no way to win I removed it, even before the board meeting that it wasscheduled to come up. After the secret meeting which I didnt bother to attendsince I knew they would not allow the feature , I was notified I was to be fined XX dollarsfor something that was on the property when it was purchased. NO EVIDENCEWAS EVER SHOWN THAT I PUT IT UP..Further more under Calif. law an HOA cannot force compliance after 5 years. Thisfeature was there for 11 years.The boards actions amount to a Conspiracy to Violate the homeowners rights.So you would think there is some recourse. NO THERE ISNT.Before you can go to small claims court, you must according to the by laws andcalifornia law go through non binding arbitration where a retired judge will give his opinion,at A COST OF 750 TO each side.Then you would go to small claims court with its dubious justice system as there is no reallaw or right of appeal there.You other alternative is to go to Superior court which will cost you from 20 thousand dollarsto 100s of thousands of dollars as they will fight you in court as hard as they can.And the bylaws state if they win they are entitled to their attorney fees, yetif you win I wonder how much you would get in attorney fees.If had 100k in attorney fees andthe judge award you 80k in fees you would still beout 20k in fees. Almost no one has that much money to spend fight the board.They know this and can easily intimidate anyone.Unfortunately this is all part of the New World Order Third World Societyamerica has become.

The human mind has endless possiblities and once you know who you are, and what you can do the world is never the same. If you were a telepath I think that it would be scary. And there should be a place for people like that to learn about themselves and learn control. And to learn how to have peace within themselves before they go mad. Some people like the thought of being an ""X-Men"" But I think at times it would be cruel and unusual punishment. Telepathy when out of control feels like a multiple personality disorder gone bad.

California Bigfoot investigators were shocked Over Memorial Day weekend when they found Bigfoot's face print and hair on their pickup truck windows!

I find it interesting that Bigfoot was investigating the investigators

Anyway sounds like a good story so I will be waiting with bated breath for the news conference on June 23 that may or may not reveal Bigfoot DNA.











This footprint was found over Memorial Day weekend, 2011, near Fresno, Calif. by a group of campers who were on a Bigfoot-hunting expedition. The print, measuring approximately 12 inches, was found near a truck where possible DNA evidence was left behind by more than one Bigfoot creature.



Investigators Hope DNA Test Will Confirm Existence of Bigfoot

Like the picture, was already posted...But I guess the world will have to wait with waited breath for that scholarly news conference at the Piccadilly Inn in Fresno!

322911,"In this thread I will state facts. From these, I will draw conclusions using basic logic. I am not going to talk about concerns surrounding weather patterns, politics, economics, and potential disasters that you all know of.



Fact: There has been a giant increase in UFO sightings and unexplained light phenomena. From this we can say that they are here to either OBSERVE something, and/or DO something (why else would they be here?) From this logic we can infer that they know something we don't, because they are here to do SOMETHING. The vast majority of humanity believes that nothing ""out of the ordinary"" is happening or about to happen. But to them, something is unfolding.



Fact: There are videos depicting extra-terrestrial beings or 'orbs of light' moving at impossible speeds and making impossible aerodynamic movements. Implying that these videos are 100% authentic, we can state that these beings do not apply to the laws of physics in our natural world . Our natural world can be defined as ""all matter and energy [...] scientifically observable"".



Now, here's where the line gets fuzzy, because talking about other realities is illogical. Hell, the idea of a UFO is illogical. Feel free to argue with me on this one, but I think I have a pretty valid conclusion.



Based on the fact that UFOs/ ET beings do not apply to our realm of physics, I have come to the conclusion that these beings apply to a different realm of physics. This is a paradox, however, since they are observable in our natural world.



Based on the hypothesis that ETs apply to a different realm of physics could mean many things. However, I think the most logical explanation is that they are extra-dimensional. Now, where does that leave us?



Currently, there are extra-dimensional ETs surrounding our world that know something we don't. I find this quite odd, considering the date.



From here, we can only theorize what comes. I think that because there are extra-dimensional beings observing us, then something of extra-dimensional nature awaits, whether that be a second-coming or ascension (or both!). (Oh look-- I just gained 30 haters!)



In all seriousness. I do believe that I am a rational person. However, all rationale can be thrown out the window based on this simple paradox that faces us today: What made our universe? The Big Bang? What created the Big Bang? What created the thing that created the Big Bang?



This, my friends is why you cannot and should not dismiss the realm of possibility that potentially awaits us in the coming days.

What: One million sq. ft. underground facility

Where: Anacostia, Washington D.C.

When: Construction early 2010-early/mid 2012

Why: ""Coast Guard Headquarters"", yeah right

Who: Dept. of Homeland Security

How: Excavation from side of mound



Satellite locating is simple. Go to Rt. 295/Suitland Pkwy. intersection (overpass). With N pointing up, the woodline under the apartment complex (south of the overpass) is one side of the mound. Structures on top of facility and entire apartment complex are likely to be demolished. Not certain this side will be construction entrance but am assuming. Recently told our local shopping mall is close to that square footage so I'm convinced it's purpose is of a massive scale. Obviously not the typical off-the-beaten-path area for a facility, but nowhere in D.C. is. Multiple levels with top level not far from surface. Entrance visible will not exceed two stories. Inside will be split into corrodores, that large of a wide open space would not support the weight above. The budget for concrete alone is approximately eighty million dollars, while total cost is estimated to be between six and seven hundred million dollars. One company recommended a more efficient excavation from above, government rejected and want it from the side, assuming satellite photograph leaks to be the reason.



This is all I know thus far. I do not presume to know it's real purpose. We've had plenty of places for years for continuity of government (probably many more we still don't know about), so future ""civilian"" detainment is my best guess for the moment. Not a 12-21-12 ""freak"", but do think the elite know something we don't. Whether it's astronomical, spiritual, environmental, or economical-something is happening. In my opinion, the timing of the facility's completion is not a coincedence. I do have many things I could be doing with my time, this is not nonsense. Comments and questions very welcome.

GW Bush, State of the Union Speech



My fellow Americanites and Do-Gooders,



Let me be the first to congratulate me on a job well done.



In the time since I have been immersed in National politics, I have managed to change the world.



Not only did I manage to attain the office of President, but I did so by losing the popular vote. I want to thank my Daddy for appointing those supreme court judges that guaranteed me the office I hold today. Thank you Daddy.



I also want to thank Katherine Harris.....errr...I mean congresswoman Harris, for guaranteeing my win of the State of Florida by scrubbing so many ""useless eaters"" from the ballots. Thankfully, the person in charge of the elections in florida was also co-chair of my election campaign in the state. Thanks Kathy, check is in the mail.



Where would I be without my brother, who also had some input on the florida debacle, seeing as how he governs the state of florida.



Many of you voted for me thinking I was a moderate. Wow, those commercials sure do work don't they? Guess what, I'm a hard right wing idealogue who was appointed by God.



During my administration, I have created thousands of jobs....in other countries. I have given enormous tax-cuts....to the people who need the money the least. Now those trust-fund kids will never have to work again, thanks to god and my administratering abilities.



Many of you (I'm not talking about my friends, the mainstream press but the real terraists, independent thinkers) have criticized my wealthy and politically connected family and for having financial ties to the bin laden family. During wartime, its unconsionable to question my motives for not holding the bin-laden family for questioning after the attack. I quickly whisked them out of the states to protect YOU, the american people. Its only coincidence that wherever osama bin-laden goes, whether afghanistan, Iraq, wherever, government contractors and elite family wealth benefit. The patriot act only applies to people who don't do business with me, or my family...or other muslimoids...terraists all of them.

Although there really is an infinite combination of ""ifs"" and ""buts"", what I came about with (in a nutshell) is this: If the government, Cabal, whoever, was developing say new technology for the express purpose of defending the US population from external threats, and informing the puplic of the existence of this technology or its use would cause unnecessary public disruption, I wouldnt necessarily have a problem with it being kept secret.Indeed, I'll even go a bit further and say that the gov might even have a right to keep the public in the dark about potential threats that are not publicly known, especially if there isnt anything the public can do about it. Example, if an orbital war was being waged against potential alien invaders.However, I DO have problems with keeping everything a secret from the public when the powers that be decide to completely disregard the constitution and personal freedoms. For example, the illegal, unconstitutional land grab performed by the USAF to obtain Freedom Ridge and prevent civilians from watching things at Area 51. They obtained 94000 acres of property illegally, as per federal law, any land acquisition over 50000 acres requires congressional approval. This never happened.Also, if I can refer you to the seismic threadThere is a good deal of evidence that this very technology is NOT being used against external threats, but AGAINST the American public.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Well, from my angle. You all jumped into bed with us on risky investments, (your banks), now we are bailing them out 10's of billions at a time.



You guys through a fit on our stimulus for trying to make it US only.

Why do you need any of that?



If you don't need us, fine. You should really think about it.



The international bankers did all of this on the hard working backs of Americans



If you don't think so, then maybe you should think again while your on ""Holiday"", for 8 weeks this summer.



Most Americans just as soon go back several decades and keep it here.



I don't know why Western Europian countries have to bust our balls when China is the real problem.

The US is not bailing out foreign banks!Yes, a lot of the US bailout money is going to foreign banks through debts owed or replacement for toxic assets sold/bought by US banks that claimed bailout money but this is the bank paying off its debts to keep its rating in order to be able to get loans in future.Most EU countries have already bailed out their banks that succumbed to toxic assets.The US banks are the ones sitting on the biggest amount of toxic assets.. thats why they are getting so much money. Property prices didn't collapse overall in the EU.. therefore not as many toxic assets.. hence, not as much bailout money needed.WTO.. a deal is a deal.. You take the good with the bad.If the US is doesn't need the EU, why doesn't it just go ahead with the protectionism?? Simple.. because the US needs the EU and cant handle the backlash that would occur.If the EU decided out of nowhere to do the same thing.. the US would also try get it to stop.Also, you are hardly turning your back on open capitalism in favour of 'Actual' socialism in the form of protectionism.. your not a communist are you(Had to throw that in there.. some American dude said something like that to me before)I never said that.. The US always has a place in our hearts.My point was that there is no need to go around slating the World for trying to move away from US dominance because of US plundering... its a simple, true point.Welcome to the club.. we got that deal since the middle ages.I work for myself for 70 hours a week, 50 weeks of the year and even if I was on a 40hour week with long holidays and earning more than someone in the same position in your country.. who's the sucker there? Thats just obvious jealousy and a pretty stupid comment to make tbh.We're not bustin your balls.. your country is just not used to other economies having a say in its matters.. its obvious you don't like it but you will have to get used to it.The US used its dominance over other half the worlds countries since WW2..The EU is a bigger economy and has leverage over the US so the US has to listen and in many cases do what its told...dont take it to heart..its called a bi-polar global economy..soon to be tri polar when China is big enough..You lot will be really pissed off all the time when China starts making demands.So will we for that matter..

very very small

Insomniac,Yes, I did miss your point there. Thanks for setting me straight.However, I still don't agree that anything unusual is going on here. You might well be right about more people noticing these usually less frequently observed phenomena though, but that could just be due to more people who tend to watch the sky more visiting these forums. I wouldn't be surprised if the internet itself has not contributed towards a greater awareness of events occurring in the night sky amongst a certain segment of the population - the ability to communicate such as we are doing here and now must have a bearing on it.It is only natural that some of them would gravitate here, giving the impression that more people are seeing these things, when in fact it's just people that have seen these things in the past coming out of the woodwork (as well as the new ""army of sky watchers"" that the internet has created).I have only been an amateur astronomer for about a decade, so perhaps I can't see the bigger picture as well as you, but it does seem to me that in the last 10 years or so, with the help of the internet, people (astronomers in particular) are more willing to talk more openly bout the stranger things they see, which might at one time have been scoffed on.As an amateur astronomer, quite frankly, I'd be more willing to gauge the ""unusualness of the current situation"" by what I observe with my very own eyes, and the reports I regularly receive from fellow amateur astronomers. These are people from around the world who have in some cases observed the sky, regularly looking for meteors (ie naked eye observing), for many decades in some cases. Many of them, including myself, are so passionate about this we will often go to extreme lengths to find dark clear skies with wide uninterrupted horizons and observe until first light, or till you can no longer keep your eyes open. Which ever comes first.Anyway, my point is, if anything unusual was going on up there recently, I'd be in a good position to know about it IMHO, and so far I've seen nothing to indicate that...In my 10 years I've also seen the weak flashes associated with space-junk, and this is often reported in the meteor observing community and a well known phenomenon.As for exploding meteors, I saw more of those in the night that hooked me than I can remember - There's some footage from the same night in this Sky At Night episode: Meteor Mania: November 2007, BBC4 Special and some written accounts here Last year I photographed a small exploding meteor. U2U me if you'd like to see it - I warn you, it's not the best shot in the world though.Edit to add: It's also not considered too unusual to see bright flashes that light the ground/sky/ or can be seen ""over the horizon"", which can often be attributed to distant lightning, meteors, transformer accidents, rail lines, or any number of possibles that range from mundane to relatively rare,and explainable causes...In short it could be anything, and is probably not due to aliens (at least in most cases!), although I like to keep an open mind about these things, so there may be apossibility, that some of these may be due to yet undocumented phenomena - but lets not jump to any conclusions about there being aliens involved yet![edit on 5-7-2008 by C.H.U.D.]",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't want to read more posts about ""this is a prop, we've already found the photo!"" when the prop doesn't actually match the pictures 100%. I don't care if it's ""very similar."" There is no way to know if a fake alien prop was made based off of the real photos just to mislead the general public and, yet again, leave the ""it's a hoax"" fall-back explanation that the government loves to create. Even the most similar prop posted in this thread still has some notable differences and isn't close enough for me to definitively say ""yep, that's the same prop.""

Totally and completely agree 100% with your assertion. Why discuss if the prop was made before or after the video was shot, IF WE STILL HAVENT PROVED ITS A PROP in the original photos?Does it look similar? Yup. Does it look identical? ABSOLUTELY NOT. There are differences. And I have yet to see any kind of props like this sold at Kmart. There have been NO KMART store links provided.Why is the photo conveniently named ""Kmart Alien"", by whoever s PRIVATE PHOTOBUCKET account?Why have I seen NO PACKAGING from Kmart for this prop? Surely there would be an elaborate box for something like this.How much would such an elaborate prop with a lever at the back of the head to make the eyes blink cost?Special effects props ARE VERY EXPENSIVE because LATEX IS VERY EXPENSIVE.Does not make sense that a prop of such high quality, and clearly so expensive would ever be sold at walmartBut heres the real kicker: NONE OF THESE REASONS EVEN MATTER, BECAUSE THE PROP DOES NOT MATCH THE ORIGINAL ET IN THE VIDEO.OG",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
212726,"SPRITES: Intelligent Light Source, Army, Navy, NASA, investigateIn my ongoing quest to find some accurate explanation for my Sprite encounters I've found a few sites that detail how the Sprite Light works. It turns out that these little radiant white lights I see are not white at all but more of a varying lite/deep reddish color. I've said before that the Sprite is quick but I had no idea that they were One Tenth the speed of Light!!! The human eye has trouble capturing the color of an object moving that fast so this explains why I see radiant white lights. About 2 1/1 weeks ago I did notice a radiant orange Sprite the size of a cantaloupe merging into the wall but I will have details on that experience later on.In this post I will start to connect some dots with a stationary Light Ring my brother and I witnessed New Years eve/day 1997. and There is a good reason why. Sprites are small spheres that explode in our atmosphere, like most explosions there is a cloud of energy stretching out in all directions away from the center blast. When this event takes place the Sprite no longer exists and so it becomes an Elf. The Elf is a ring of energy that lasts a few milliseconds then it disappears. Some scientists have managed to capture these phenoms on cameras that capture 1,000 to 10,000 frames per second. Unfortunately I possess no such technology so I'm using one of their pictures to show you how the Sprite Lights look.Sprite LightWhat my brother and I saw New Years eve/day 1997 most likely can be compared to an Elf. Here is what happened:I have not witnessed a stationary light source since New Years eve/day 1997. During the final minutes of 1996 my brother called me outside without giving a very good reason why I should stop watching the countdown in Times Square. You have to keep in mind that I've never bothered researching unexplained phenoms up to this point. Now that I know people like you all exist I regret not taking a picture of what I saw when I walked outside.My brother led the way and told me to stop when I reached the center of the outdoor balcony. It was cool and dark outside but quiet. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, then my brother stood right beside me, lifting his hands up to the sky while pointing.I looked up and saw a purple ring. It was hovering silently in the sky 25+ feet above the balcony. The ring was so big you could have driven a freight truck through it. There were reddish flames bouncing off the rim of this purple ring which I can only describe as thin, short, and translucent. The ring would glow bright purple then a dim shade of purple.We stood there and stared at it for a while, the only movement came from the surrounding reddish flames on the rim. After a few minutes I walked indoors and rang in 1997 like nothing happened. No pictures were taken.The purple ring was not there the next night, any previous night and I've never seen anything like it in my town since. I wasn't sure what to make of it then and I'm still not quite sure if I can make an association with the sprite lights that I see now but the research I'm doing on Sprites has led me to NASA, Sci Tech, and National Geographic+ websites that accurately describe my own encounters with these lights. As I've said before these sites explain why I see them as white when in reality they are a reddish color like the flames on the purple ring. The human eye can not comprehend these colors when the Sprite is moving at One Tenth the Speed of Light so what I see is a white blur. Most sprite lights have a lifespan of 3 to 10 milliseconds so a camera that snaps 10,000 frames per second is more helpful when capturing the Sprite Light than my own 1 frame per 10- second camera. (Unless the Sprite is Stationary)This is a drawing of what I saw New Years eve/day 1997Possible Elf New Years eve/day 1997Compare this picture taken above the clouds by Sprite Hunters to my New Years eve/day 1997 picture. This ring was caused by the Sprite Lights exploding in our atmosphere causing an Elf.Sprite Hunters Photo: Sprites/Elf The ChemEnergy website states that these explosions are leaving behind Chemical Residue in our atmosphere. Another link says, Sprites may eat away at Earths protective Ozone layer and some people may mistake them for UFOs.The Air Force, Naval Research Lab, NASA, and Univeristy of Alaska teamed up in the summer of 1998 to document Sprite Activity. They've found out what I already told you in the beginning of this thread. Sprites are quick, bright, come and go as they please so there is no set time to view them , and you just wait for them to show up. but These Sprite Hunters are looking above the clouds to witness this event. I'm on the ground and I had no prior contact with these sites before my own Sprite experience. So why are Sprites on ground level and above the clouds? The professional Sprite Hunters are looking for the source of these lights. I think they are looking in the wrong place because the Sprites I see travel from some unknown ground level then up, sometimes through walls, then through my ceiling. I've even witnessed a Sprite turn off its light and become what I can only describe as a pinto bean. and What is this Chemical Residue that Professor Sentman claims these Sprite explosions leave in our atmosphere?Are Sprites actually Alien like Flares used to guide SpaceCraft to our Planet from other worlds too? These Sprite Lights only last 3 to 10 milliseconds and would be a great way to send a message that most humans wouldn't even NOTICE!!!!Strange Night Lights and a Loud BOOM story have made the rounds on my local News Cast TWICE this year.

218152,"Sounds normal to me. It's very well possible that your kid is.....well, seeing something that's a little stange. Maybe he's seeing ghosts, orbs, shadow creatures (or maybe the kid is afraid of actual shadows, lol). This sounds similar to what my uncle one told me about his kid when he was about 3-4. He was in bed, the parents in one bed, the kid in another right next to theirs. That's when my uncle hears his wooden steps creeking. OK, so steps like that creek, nothing strange about about, but what is strange is that each one was making a soft creek, one by one, as if someone was quietly going up. My uncle is just listening to this when he suddenly hears (and sees) his son's bedroom door slightly crack open. That's when the kid starts screaming and going totaly nuts. Of course, my uncle instantly sprang up, ran to the bedroom, started cursing and yelling at the ghost to not mess with his kid and that it could live at his house so long as it doesn't interfere. You may find it strange that someone would actually reem out a ghost, but my uncle is confident about this stuff. In addition to that, his T.V. turned on by itself 3 times in one day when no one was anywhere near it (it stopped turning on when my uncle gave the ghost another talking to), he also had the feeling of being watched several times. (perhaps this is the 'strange' feeling you sometimes get?). All this stuff began happening not long after my uncle moved in, I must also mention thta both of the last two residents (they were a married couple) had lived and died in that house and that supposedly they were both very nice (perhaps they're trying to be kind now to since they've helped out also). By that I mean that something had physically grabbed my uncle's leg to awake him when his kids were unattended (this happend twice). Yes, that house is indeed haunted, even my grandma who doesn't like talking about ghosts admits that she too had odd feeling while there.Well, I hope you can relate to that. Knowing the history of your house is important. Just remember, all that I said was true, I nor my uncle have no reason to make up something like this, you have my word. I only mentioned about half of the things that happen at my uncle's house. The thing is, kids usually see/notice things that adults do not. I know that when I was younger I had night terrors where I started imagining things and couldn't sleep. If you ask me, I'd say that you should just talk it out with your kid and try to comfort him and try to keep the truth about ghosts away from him. I don't know about you, but when I was a kid, thinking about ghosts seriously scared me and I like to think that this may be true for other kids too. Relax, your kid is just having the **** scared out of him by something, I'm sure it's normal.[edit on 101/30/0606 by Acekwak]",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Then why should anyone pay those things for old people? My own grandmother is a good example. She has $$160,000, in the bank, and she wants food stamps because living costs too much. A lot of the elderly do this, and take advantage of the things they're offered. I think a better way to go about the problem is to lower the cost of living overall, lower tuition, and lower the mortgages. The profit margin in this country has gotten too high. Bad business models and other crap spewed from very greedy people caused this years ago. That high profit margin only exists for a few select people, while the rest of the country can't seem to save any money, in order to accomplish anything in the business sector.

1) become a politician

2) become a religious figure head.



The reason for having a God is to be able to justify what you are telling the people to be true.



Example:

If I say that it is adviseable not to have babies with your sister, because it has been noticed that a large number of the offspring are ""defective"", and I put this on ATS there will be numerous objections and calls for proof.



However, if I manage to persuade people that some God has made it possible for them to be Masters of others because they are chosen among the riff raff, many people will love it.



Then we write it down and eventually we put in a sentence that God doesn't like us to have babies with our siblings. Because it is Gods will.



That is how religion starts. Someone wants to be a deciding factor for good reasons or for bad reasons. I suspect that it was mostly for good reasons.



The problem with christianity is that they claim so many things and attribute it to a Son of God that was conceived after non consensual sex between an innocent woman and a proxy. But they top it by including in their holy book a large number of texts that in many places are contradictory to the teachings they want to promote.



You cannot promote a loving God and then use large parts of The Old Testament in the way it is done.

You cannot one moment say ""this is the word of God and is not up for debate"" and the next moment claim that this other part of the Bible is ""meant to be understood this way"" because it isn't meant to be taken litterally.



Just look at how Bible bashers are quick to respond to Jesus' claim that ""I come with the sword"".

Well this ""sword"" is probably meant to be a reference to ""the gospel"".

So - are they idiots for saying that? Or are we idiots for accepting that explanation?



Christianity has got to distance itself from the old testament if they want to be taken seriously by non believers.

Which they really want to be, if we consider how much they seek to influence politics and how adamant they are in manipulating what is taught in schools.



Now as then - christianity (and any other religion) is meant for manipulation.

Christians had to invent Hell and threatens people by stating that non believers go to Hell for eternal torture.

It is a belief that all of human thought is mixed together and available to people. Some people are talking about this when they say when a time for a invention is here it will come. Throughout history whenever an invention of note has been made or a scientific discovery is made you will find that through out the world there are many who have made it at almost the same time. It is believed that only one of these people actually was the inventor but his mind projected what he thought to where others picked it up so it only appears that all of them had the same idea at the same time.There is also a second thing that to me is almost more mystical yet people talk it about it lightly all the time. If you want to have good things happen to you just keep smiling and mean it. Some think that what you feel is projected on your envirement but I myself believe that your internal beliefs allow yourself and subconcious to see what is around you already in your envirement that will advance that belief.

OK....in looking at the very first posted picture, in your OP.....I see the persistent contrail (presume from AAL100) and two more non-persistent, apparently at higher altitudes. The ""orb"" is there too (whatever it turns out to be).So. let's look at the flight plan information for AAL100, on (was it the morning of the 19th, for you? Then it departed the evening of the 18th....):In there, we see (in box on right) the original filed plan info....the actual ground track (and planned) in the visual depiction (you can zoom in) **______________________**Note: The dashed blue line is the Flight Planned track over the ground. Green is actual. Over the Atlantic Ocean, though....outside of radar coverage (and flighttracker data input) there is no info....see the gap,here:That shows up in the green line...a ""straight shot"" default. Also, just FYI, after ""coast in"" they likely were issued revised routing, since the green line stayed south of the filed route.**______________________.....and, you can also click on ""tracklog and graph"" for more details, point-by-point.The original filed altitude for the trip was 35,000 (FL 350), but you can see that for whatever reason (more favorable winds, and/or higher for better fuel consumption rate...or, because of turbulence, to find a better ""ride"", or for traffic conflict reasons)....shortly after passing 60°W they elected to cruise at FL 380 for the Oceanic portion of the Route, and the crossing.38,000 feet was held until the initial descent for the arrival to EGGL. (Heathrow). Beginning at about 4°West longitude:Reading that, left/right....TIME in US Eastern, North Latitude, then West Longitude (the '-' sign), then magnetic track over the ground (course), with the Cardinal direction....then Groundspeed (in knots) and also in MPH, and altitude. Followed by rate of descent, in feet per minute.SO....for our screen-grab info at the Casper website, of ""36,250 feet"" you can see the position approximately is --(This explains the odd altitude...if it is far from an even 1,000 feet, is usually due to a climb or descent....if only off a little, just from slight variations in the altimeters' readouts. Tolerances, when at cruise, of up to about 120 feet off, in error, are allowable).American 100's contrail obviously was ""spreading"" more, based solely on the conditions that happened to prevail, at that time and place and altitude....",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

210025,"-Sorry if this is in the wrong forum i just thought this would be the place to put it-Over the years ive seen my share of ghosts and experiences. The house i lived in until i was 5 was still occupied by its former owner who was caught in a loop, he would ""break"" the ceiling fan in my bedroom ""fix it"" and leave and he wore a hat. A neighbor who knew him described him and it matched mine to the letter. But my more recent experiences are a bit odd. The house I've resided in since is new, no one has lived here before us.I can't remember when it first started but I'll just tell you my recent accounts. Over the past year my ""ghost"" had become more friendly i guess is the term. He was fully aware of me but only me it seems. No one else has or has yet to see him. At first i thought it was a hallucination since these happened at night and i was generally woken up by him. I've seen shadows and rarely voices, though i do recall hearing one call my name at least once when i was younger.This is what threw me off my original idea; the touching. Nothing sexual[just thought I'd put that out there, and im female] i would wake up to the feeling of a quick touch of my face or a ""pet"" on the head. These touches are supposed to be cold according to others but i don't recall them ever being. If anything it felt like an actual person.Yes, i was alone and my door/window is closed and locked. The catch also being i never actually saw it until the last time anything happened, which was a few months ago. I had just lain down and turned out my light when i had the strong feeling something was watching me. I am wide awake, i had not fallen asleep. I look over and see a young male silhouette, no hat or anything. If i wanted i could've reached out and touched him but i didn't. I kinda wish i did but at the same time i have no idea how i would react if i happened to feel something. I can't really remember what i did after this but i felt the ""pet"" on the head again after i looked away.Seeing him/it freaked me out a little bit but generally these things never really bug/bugged me. I would just shrug it off and go back to sleep, things like this don't scare me. Sometimes i was more annoyed i had been woken up because i had to get up early the next dayIn the more recent cases before i saw him he mainly seemed to show up when i was really sad or depressed over something. Leading me to believe he was drawn to/fed off this negative energy.After some research it seemed that this ghost was a shadow person, but some things just don't fit.

, thank you for your input. And you are right, this prize has little to do with the internal affairs of US. The prize is about this planet called EARTH, not USA.Personally I am both happy and very proud that my country has awarded Obama the Nobel Peace Prize. Obama has given the world a hope for change to the better. I think the prize is well deserved.I don't think you will find any politicians or officials in Norway who would say this in in public, but there is no doubt in my mind that this award also is a kick in the but and a message to president Bush. Do Americans have any idea how SCARY Bush was to the rest of the world? Do you have any idea what a RELIEF it was when you guys finally managed to elect someone with a brain?Bush was VERY much disliked, at least by people here in Scandinavia. People had NO respect for him AT ALL. He came across as this shallow, clumsy and not very bright man, completely controlled and manipulated by some really creepy, evil charachters around him. It was like ANYTHING could happen with this man in the White House. Anything bad. And bad things sure did happen...Like a war in Iraq. What was the reason for that war again..? Oh, someone didn't care too much about the truth, did they? And how many young American men and women have lost their lives in that war again..? How many men, children and women all together? Oh, and that American economy thing, THAT sure didn't go to well, did it..?Bush and his administration brought fear, stupidity and mistrust to the world. Fear, stupidity and mistrust opens up for hate and war.Obama brought hope to the world. Hope opens up for collaboration, understanding and PEACE. THAT is the reason he was given the Nobel Peace Prize.Congratulations, president Obama. As a Norwegian citizen and tax payer this prize is from me too. I am proud to give it to you, and welcome to Oslo!(Oh, and to spare some of you a good, long rant: Yes, I am a leftie and proud of that too.But feel free to flame me anyway.

i for one have always thought it was really strange how people just ""existed"" like we were all born into this world and we go about our day to day business yet we really havent been here long in terms of all recorded history. then we go about our normal day to day routines and business and dont really think a whole lot about these kind of things. that being said ill tell you guys my opinion of all this, because honestly thats all we really have in regards to these kinds of things.



so personally i feel like all of life is just a simulation, a ""program"" and i believe we truly do ""choose"" to come here, this is where it gets weird because im also a Christian and this belief im sharing is not based in any Biblical doctrine. i believe that we are all eternal infinite beings who served God in Heaven before coming to earth, but in order to completely prove our love for God, we have to exist in a simulation or scenario where we never knew God but chose Him. kind of like asking your spouse or love of your life ""if we met in a different setting or different time, would we still have fallen in love?"" because if so, that means your soul mates! of course this is all my opinion so i cant really answer any specific questions about it outside of just opinion.



i remember my mom told me when i was an adult that as a young child about 3 or 4 i used to cry all the time saying i wanted to go home, and she led me through a series of multiple questions over a long period where i eventually told her i had come from heaven and that i told her i cried because i ""chose"" to come here and regretted choosing so. to take it a step further i would draw alot at that age, nothing significant in terms of drawing but my parents asked me ""where did you get your ideas to draw?"" and i told them my ideas were what i saw before coming to earth. but there it is though, thats just my opinion on things, and honestly ive held onto that belief my whole life and it does complement my Christian beliefs as well, and truth is i know im going ""home"" someday, in terms of heaven, so if im going there someday according to my Biblical doctrines, then it must not be too much of a longshot to believe i also came from there.



i know life teaches you its all about the here and the now, and if you cant see it or prove it logically, then your insane to believe it, but something about life in general just speaks ""simulation"", it just doesnt feel like this is all there is.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
317120,"The term ""Russia's allies"" does is not meant to refer to any country in particular at the present, but rather to be interpreted in the future. Indeed currently there are no clear cut alliances at the moment. If I had to name any, then Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Armenia loosely fall within that realm (in terms of military alliance, not just economic).



This ""new"" doctrine really shouldn't be over interpretted since it is not technically new. The only change is that it has been made official. This is likely related to ongoing efforts to reform and restructure Russia's armed forces and defense ministries.



In practice the doctrine isn't really different from that of the US, however US chooses to keep it's doctrine less detailed and largely unpublicized for political reasons.

The video though is very out there but the song is called ET so the video makes sense that they would use the images and innuendos that they do.

[edit on 9/4/2008 by Good Wolf]

The only proof I will provide for you is this: On October 13th, the last of the artificial (science based) constructs will expire. About a week prior to this and up to the the American presidential elections many governments will cease to function and will collapse, necessitating snap elections and so forth. How they transition themselves to properly functioning natural states is outlined in their respective constitutions.There will be a minimum of social upheaval, as the anarchists, atheists, etc. (aka the enemies of order) will have lost the remainder of what little power they still have. No World War, no economic collapse, just the ""Changing of the Guard"" happening quietly and smoothly, as per the design. The price of oil and other criticle commodities will stabilize and the dollar with strengthen as uncertainty will diminish. All goverments will soon be under the control of the True King.If you want to prove me wrong, you'll have to do more than debate, this is going to require action on your part. The power that is going to make this happen, you don't happen to believe in so I am not sure how you intend to stop it. However, since this is not proof until it happens we will see what is what on November 5th.It's actually already begun, at least four major problem states have ceased to function properly in the past two weeks: Canada, Japan, Thailand, Pakistan. Israel has already stopped working and its Prime Minister will resign by the end of the month.The list of holdouts such as Iran, Venezuela and North Korea, examples of the most brutal artificial states, while they may be able to hold on to power in their respective regions, they'll have zero influence outside their own borders and they'll slowly evaporate and transition by natural processes. But I don't want to rule out the possibility that they'll implode in a spectacular fashion, but such a thing would not be within anyones interests.See, from my point of view atheists, anarchists, racists, sexists, are the problem in this world and the harbringers of faulty belief systems, so War has been brought upon them. You will witness the destruction of your ideal state and find yourself being completely dominated by believers in all aspects of your life. The White House will be occupied by evangelicals and those who are weak of faith, will be standing around in absolute shock as to what is really going down.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I found it extremely odd because usually it is done locally. What I mean is there is a message that rolls across the screen that reads something like ""This is a required weekly test for the following counties.."" and usually its just for the county you live in or maybe for the state you live in.

I found that extremely odd. I have never seen one that said ""The United States."" Ususally when the alert is activated it is for weather related and mostly local events. Why the United States as a whole?



In my opinion, the only reason to have a nation wide alert would be incase of war...thats what it was designed for in the first place. Could things be getting worse with Russia? I just heard that NATO froze their relations with Russia. Recent threats of attacks on Poland, could we be closer than we know to conflict with Russia?

118879,"i think the truth is mere opinion. because like opinion it is subjective and relative.



""bush is a bad man"" and people claim this as fact. but they are basing this on opinion, which is nothing more than ones own personal thoughts on any given topic and they view this as fact because they believe it to be true. this doesnt make it so universally, only for them.



people often confuse the two while they arent so dissimilar from each other.



a truth would be something like fire is hot. of course it can be argued that it is simply not cold, which is also correct. this is where perspective and interpretation come into play.



from our upbringing and outside influences to our own personal experiences we develop a train of thought, a mindset if you will. in this mindset we have certain qualifiers or standards of what we accept as ""the truth"" and when something falls between the minimums and maximums we view it as a truth even if it isnt. now why is this? because we want it to be true. wanting it to be true doesnt make it anymore true than it really is but we still believe it is.



we also view certain things as true because it reenforces our mindset or beliefs. we see other people going to church for example and people use that as a reenforcer for their own beliefs that the church is good. their opinion is that church is good and they use other people going as the evidence to prove this assertion. but this doesnt make it a fact. this is what a lot of us do, form an opinion and then use evidence that will back up our opinion and dismiss everything else because we want to be right. most of us if not all of us do this, on a daily basis even.



the truth is whatever we want it to be based on our own prejudices and mindset. we are taught to believe something and over time we view it as being true even if it isnt. an example for this would be thievery. we believe stealing is wrong. why? we base this on what we were taught, that stealing is wrong or even our own experiences from people stealing from us or even getting caught stealing and being punished for it. however there are those who were taught that stealing ir wrong but still do it anyway. hmmm odd isnt it? but is stealing really wrong or is it just something we view as morally wrong? morality is not truth, it is an opinion that things should gbe a certain way and people should their lives according to certain beliefs.



a problem with ""truth"" is this, no matter how much you learn about something, say a particular situation, you're going to miss some tidbits of information. this is important because those tidbits can completely change ones PERSPECTIVE on that situation and that could cause us to view themselves as being true or false. now compound this with our own prejudices that dismiss information that doesnt fit the mold and now you have have a biased outlook.

This agency was consolidated with the Bureau of Prohibition, Division of Investigation, in the Department of Justice via E.O. 6166 of June 10, 1933.

I mean, a contrail will persist if the ambient temperature at the place where the contrail is formed is below minus forty degrees and the relative humidity is saturated .

The issuing power should be taken from the banks & restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.” ~ President Thomas Jefferson, 1801-1809“Whoever controls the money of a nation, controls that nation & is absolute master of all industry & commerce. When you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation & depression originate.” ~ President James Garfield, 1891“Capital must protect itself in every possible manner by combination & legislation.

If you set to know yourself fully, facing with honesty and hardness.Rule 18If you want to change the ways others treat you, you should first change the way you treat yourself, fully and sincerely, there is no way you can be loved. Once you achieve that stage, however, be thankful for every thorn that others might throw at you. It is a sign that you will soon be showered in roses.Rule 19Fret not where the road will take you.

When a Sufi stares at someone, he keeps both eyes closed instead opens a third eye – the eye that sees the inner realm.Rule 22Life is a temporary loan and this world is nothing but a sketchy imitation of Reality. Only children would mistake a toy for the real thing. And yet human beings either become infatuated with the toy or disrespectfully break it and throw it aside. In this life stay away from all kinds of extremities, for they will destroy your inner balance. Sufis do not go to extremes. A Sufi always remains mild and moderate.Rule 23The human being has a unique place among God’s creation. “I breathed into him of My Spirit,” God says. Each and every one of us without exception is designed to be God’s delegate on earth. Ask yourself, just how often do you behave like a delegate, if you ever do so? Remember, it fells upon each of us to discover the divine spirit inside and live by it.Rule 24Hell is in the here and now. So is heaven. Quit worrying about hell or dreaming about heaven, as they are both present inside this very moment. Every time we fall in love, we ascend to heaven. Every time we hate, envy or fight someone we tumble straight into the fires of hell.Rule 25Each and every reader comprehends the Holy Qur’an on a different level of tandem with the depth of his understanding. There are four levels of insight. The first level is the outer meaning and it is the one that the majority of the people are content with. Next is the Batin – the inner level. Third, there is the inner of the inner. And the fourth level is so deep it cannot be put into words and is therefore bound to remain indescribable.Rule 26The universe is one being. Everything and everyone is interconnected through an invisible web of stories. Whether we are aware of it or not, we are all in a silent conversation. Do no harm. Practice compassion. And do not gossip behind anyone’s back – not even a seemingly innocent remark! The words that come out of our mouths do not vanish but are perpetually stored in infinite space and they will come back to us in due time. One man’s pain will hurt us all. One man’s joy will make everyone smile.Rule 27Whatever you speak, good or evil, will somehow come back to you. Therefore, if there is someone who harbours ill thoughts about you, saying similarly bad things about him will only make matters worse. You will be locked in a vicious circle of malevolent energy. Instead for forty days and nights say and think nice things about that person. Everything will be different at the end of 40 days, because you will be different inside.Rule 28The past is an interpretation. The future is on illusion. The world does not more through time as if it were a straight line, proceeding from the past to the future. Instead time moves through and within us, in endless spirals. Eternity does not mean infinite time, but simply timelessness. If you want to experience eternal illumination, put the past and the future out of your mind and remain within the present moment.Rule 29Destiny doesn’t mean that your life has been strictly predetermined. Therefore, to live everything to the fate and to not actively contribute to the music of the universe is a sign of sheer ignorance. The music of the universe is all pervading and it is composed on 40 different levels. Your destiny is the level where you play your tune. You might not change your instrument but how well to play is entirely in your hands.Rule 30The true Sufi is such that even when he is unjustly accused, attacked and condemned from all sides, he patiently endures, uttering not a sing bad word about any of his critics. A Sufi never apportions blame. How can there be opponents or rivals or even “others” when there is no “self” in the first place? How can there be anyone to blame when there is only One?Rule 31If you want to strengthen your faith, you will need to soften inside. For your faith to be rock solid, your heart needs to be as soft as a feather. Through an illness, accident, loss or fright, one way or another, we are all faced with incidents that teach us how to become less selfish and judgmental and more compassionate and generous. Yet some of us learn the lesson and manage to become milder, while some others end up becoming even harsher than before…Rule 32Nothing should stand between you and God. No imams, priests, rabbits or any other custodians of moral or religious leadership. Not spiritual masters and not even your faith. Believe in your values and your rules, but never lord them over others. If you keep breaking other people’s hearts, whatever religious duty you perform is no good. Stay away from all sorts of idolatry, for they will blur your vision. Let God and only God be your guide. Learn the Truth, my friend, but be careful not to make a fe ti sh out of your truths.Rule 33While everyone in this world strives to get somewhere and become someone, only to leave it all behind after death, you aim for the supreme stage of nothingness. Live this life as light and empty as the number zero. We are no different from a pot. It is not the decorations outside but the emptiness inside that holds us straight. Just like that, it is not what we aspire to achieve but the consciousness of nothingness that keeps us going.Rule 34Submission does not mean being weak or passive. It leads to neither fatalism nor capitulation. Just the opposite. True power resides in submission a power that comes within. Those who submit to the divine essence of life will live in unperturbed tranquillity and peace even the whole wide world goes through turbulence after turbulence.(continued, again...dammit!)",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
207089,"Greeting fellow ATS member,



I have been watching as always with close eyes to the human civilization. Recently my mind has been..wandering over the most recent of schemes involving a large group of powerful people of both the world of banking as well as the economics.



It has come to my attention that the latest scheme for power involved a large number of different financial and political groups and individuals that together have plotted the most treacherous path of forming a global political and financial sub-matrix that serves as a relay network for political control over the financial grid. The ultimate goal of this for mentioned plot is to gain control over both companies as well as the individual lives of you and me, the people.



To the leaders involved in this plot I will warn you to not attempt a theomancy for I will have you follow the path of the titans and make you bear the weight of Atlas.



Now without further to do. There are four major super powers in this world, to be known;



- The United States of America

- The Russian Federation

- The peoples republic of China

- The European Union



One of these super power differs from the rest in a significant way. You see; one of these superpowers has a bank that is independent. A bank that can act own its own accord, or at least it could until recently.



Is it the National bank of the United States?

No. The banking in the United States has been an extension of the United States government due to the Federal Reserve System since 1913. The bank is therefor an extension of the American government and has no liberty in the handling of currency.



Is it the Bank of China?

No. The bank of China is owned for 69.265% by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange as of 2006. It is therefor in control of the Chinese government and dependent upon its primary lifeline of the Chinese government.



Is it the Bank of Russia?

No. The bank of Russia, a reformed of the old RSFSR from the former Soviet Union has by Russian law the independence that one might suspect, but is actually tied down by another law stating it has to follow the governments plans for finance.



Is it the European Central Bank?

Yes! Although the bank has got figureheads appointed to some degree by the European Union it is expected to function independently and freely.



That is, until recently. The European financial crisis is under stress and in the terms spanning 2010 till now the European Central bank has been pressed ever harder to cooperate with the European Union to fight the debt crisis. Basically buying up European financial papers for an almost 0% interest rate, effectively purchasing the dept of the European nations.



It is here that I suspect is a problem. A massive 'bubble' of dept is being pushed aroun between China, the US and Russia with especially the US in general. This bubble is a weapon, an economic weapon that can be pumped into other economics making them collapse. Gradually this bubble is being pushed into the European Union, not to bankrupt them, but to force the EU to actually nationalize the ECB thus making it an extension of the European Union, or Brussels if you would put it bluntly.



With this the mayor financial system would become fully controlled by the political figureheads of those four superpowers and the corporations, even the internationally located ones would have no choice but to loan money from those bank thus owning money as well as storing it primarily on state controlled banks making them dependent of those states. This causes a gridlock of the economics that pushes the financial control into four super political control systems. (the respective governments of before called superpowers) with very little swimming space to evade.



With only Africa, the Middle-East and South America as semi-independent and economic unstable options those corporation will have no choice but to fulfill the demands of the superpowers or risk their finances in nations that can not guaranty the safety of that capital.



It will also directly allow the governments to control the finances of every single citizen who have mostly no refuge of that control. With the further virtualisation of the currency this would mean that citizens would become prisoners of their own nations as they could not move their finances to other banks.



In short; it would lock both companies as well as citizens up in a four power controlled gridlocked political economy.

This thread made me think of a few slightly unsettling things, so here is a copy/paste of what i posted in that thread.



""Its would seem that ATS is not unlike any other organisation or website in that it has a seperate elitist group who get special treatment.

In this case the elitist group are those who have the requisite points to enter the Really Above Top Secret area.

The trouble with the system in use to gain access to the R.A.T.S section is that it is open to absue, seclusion, and in a way discrimination.

Now i do not have any proof of this and it is therfore it is just an idea/suggestion of one possible situation.

For example there may be a member who is on the verge of having the requisite points for R.A.T.S. something like 4995, but due to perhaps a moderator or one of the elitist members of the R.A.T.S. section has a problem with this person their points get docked for some trivial or made up reason thereby stopping their entry into the R.A.T.S. area.

This is just one way that the need of a set number of points to enter the R.A.T.S section may be abused and used to keep certain people out of the elite forums.

Again i say this is just a possibility and i have no proof, it is just an idea.""



Does anyone have an opinion on this? both those who are part of R.A.T.S. and those who arn't scared of posting their true opinions incase they suffer some kind of discrimination in the future, i say this because i realise that some people are a little wary of posting antything that may annoy the wrong people and that they could suffer points or otherwise because of that.

Are you aware, Geek, that there is ALWAYS military on duty ready to respond to an attack within 1 minute? THis includes fighter pilots, too. No way could America be attacked without our govt being able to intercept.



THe truth is, with all due respect, Geek, that you, along with alot of the rest of America, has been had.

Quote from : Oil Change Reignites Debate Over GPS Trackers



SAN FRANCISCO – Yasir Afifi, a 20-year-old computer salesman and community college student, took his car in for an oil change earlier this month and his mechanic spotted an odd wire hanging from the undercarriage.



The wire was attached to a strange magnetic device that puzzled Afifi and the mechanic.



They freed it from the car and posted images of it online, asking for help in identifying it.



Two days later, FBI agents arrived at Afifi's Santa Clara apartment and demanded the return of their property — a global positioning system tracking device now at the center of a raging legal debate over privacy rights.

Quote from : Wikipedia : Fourth Amendment



The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution is the part of the Bill of Rights which guards against unreasonable searches and seizures.



The amendment specifically also requires search and arrest warrants be judicially sanctioned and supported by probable cause.



It was adopted as a response to the abuse of the writ of assistance, which is a type of general search warrant, in the American Revolution.



Search and arrest should be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court, usually by a law enforcement officer, who has sworn by it.



In Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961), the Supreme Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment applies to the states by way of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.



The Supreme Court has also ruled that certain searches and seizures violated the Fourth Amendment even when a warrant was properly granted.

Another one busted when the Government oversteps their legal bounds to do their jobs.Sorry, there is a legal and correct means to do a job for Law Enforcement, and then there is this idiotic approach.Unless serving a warrant, asking a citizen questions whether in regards to themselves or others, or to report for a 911 call, no one is allowed to violate the sanctity of a citizens private property, there are of course a few other exceptions, but very few, and as well they need to be, as in the Government, whether F.B.I. or Law Enforcement, through policy, procedure, and protocol, and via a manner which is unquestionably ethical in regards to actual deterrent of criminal activities.Especially when it comes to putting something on a citizens vehicle, home, or person, you cannot allow this type of infringement to happen because this is a complete, total, and heinous and extemporaneous violation of the, unlawful search and seizure.Theis covered under the usage of the G.P.S. device, searching for a citizens locale, and through this the lawyer this guy can hire, can also cite potential for tampering with his clients vehicle, whether it happened or not.Thecomes into play with the seizure of information which was obtained via the G.P.S. device.A citizen has the right to not purchase a vehicle with G.P.S. or OnStar (same thing basically) and has the right to safety, the placement of this device is a direct violation of his safety, due to the placement upon his vehicle, whereupon the lawyer can tear into the F.B.I. about a potential for tampering within vehicle, again whether it happened or not, as well as that he is being legally tracked, in essence electronically stalking the citizen, through illegal means.ghostryder21, come on by the thread above, and introduce your thread there, and I will go more into depth about the illegality of it.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Just a thought but why don't you look these up yourself? Or find the email address to an evolutionary scientist and send it to someone who's an actual expert. You won't find many experts here on ATS, though some might claim to be most people here are layman who brush up on the subject from time to time. Another important thing to point out is that there doesn't need to be a WHY answer. What evolves isn't necessarily BETTER than what came before, it only has to be good enough to survive and reproduce.It is thought that sexual reproduction was developed amongst single-celled life BEFORE multicellularity was, thus meaning that the first multicellular life didn't have to rely on dividing the way a single-celled organism would. I took the liberty of doing a Google Scholar search on the subject of Multicellular Evolution . That should help you in your research.Last I checked it was, bacteria and single-celled lifeforms far outnumber us multicellular ones. That being said sexual reproduction has benefits, it increases genetic variation and diversity. Rather than just a world full of single-celled clones of other single-cells mutations and genetic changes can occur much faster and must easier in a gene pool, a population of sexually reproducing organisms will likely vary greater genetically than asexual reproductive organisms.Why does something have to be wrong with it in order for sexual reproduction to develop? Again evolutionary changes, in order to be passed on, simply need to function, they do not need to be perfect or even necessarily be an improvement on what came before. Survival of the fittest actually means that what's FIT enough to pass on its genes will survive. It only has to be FIT ENOUGH.As for the egg thing, here's an article that might help, but again those are good questions to ask actual scientists: Evolution in Action This one is OBVIOUS. What animals typically feel the most emotion toward each other? SOCIAL ANIMALS. What animals typically portray the most altruistic behavior toward each other? SOCIAL ANIMALS. Social animals thrive in groups and while its true there are some who do this seemingly without emotion (ants for instance) mammals have the benefit of a much bigger brain capable of complex emotional states. This allows for social mammals to bond and thus survive.Emotions help you fit into the group and bond with members of it and they help with empathy so you can understand how your actions might affect another member of the group. All of this adds up to better survival especially when it comes to a species like humans, our young as so vulnerable, and, as they say, it takes a village to raise a child.No but a clever animal might have the smarts to outwit a predator, and that drives the predator to either get smarter itself or die off. Seriously this is common sense.Let's see, I see trees outside, cars passing by, I see my laptop monitor... I see my TV... But I can't SEE God, not in the actual sense of the word SEE.Let's say for a moment that I reject the Big Bang, why would that suddenly mean I have to believe that the supernatural is the answer? Same thing here. Why would rejecting Evolution make the supernatural a viable option? Rejecting evolution is no more reason to believe in the Christian/Jewish/Muslim God than it is a reason to believe in Zeus or Odin,As a former Creationist myself I hope you seek answers from the actual experts. Don't take my word or the word of anyone on ATS on it, look up the information for yourself. And remember that even if evolution fails that doesn't make the supernatural answer the right one, you'd still have to find evidence for that.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thank you for reading

I am taking the opportunity here to explore an idea that has taken me over ten years to develop. I had previously introduced it on this thread: The theory we inhabit a Binary Star system? and are now aware that although it feels quite simple to me, I am not sure I am explaining it well enough. As a result, I ask forgiveness in advance if some of my words read a little condescending, that is not my intention but instead simply to have my message undestood.Please feel free to ask questions, point out perceived errors and in other words force me to keep explaining until it all makes perfect sense.This post may be a little long but I ask you to bear with me if you have any interest in the following:The (commonly accepted but not accurate approximated ‘25,920’ year long) Precession of the Stars also known as axial precession and the precession of the equinoxes.The possibility that the Earth spends time above and below the galactic plane.The theory that the (between 22.1° and 24.5°) tilt of the Earth’s axis wobbles around (clockwise, looking down from the North) being the cause of (A) as it is explained in the above link.The plane of the Moon’s orbit of the Earth and the difference between the changing positions of a Full Moon rise and the Sun rise throughout the year.I do not agree with (C – the wobbling axial tilt) and in this post I am setting out to explain why I do not agree with the theory of the wobbling Earth axis being the cause of (A), the Precession of the Stars and what I believe is the cause of the phenomena.Please, do not fear or expect a complex delivery, I will not be entering into any mathematical formula or complex physics. If you can grasp the basic idea that the Earth orbits the Sun maintaining its axial tilt, resulting in the changing seasons (Summer, Autumn, Winter & Spring) throughout a year on Earth, then I believe that you will be able to grasp what I am getting at.Please allow me to begin.The premise of this idea is in three parts: The tilt of the Earth’s axis does not wobble as widely accepted but instead remains pretty close to constant. The Earth spends time above and below the galactic plane. The stars actually DO rotate around our solar system during the Precession of the Stars. I have named the imaginary axis which our solar system orbits the Hammar Axis.What I mean by that is: if you were able to observe the Earth from an imaginary stationary place outside our galaxy for thousands of years you would see very little change to the angle or tilt of the Earth’s axis. Any changes to it would be the result of events on Earth (Eg. major Earthquakes) or other stellar objects either colliding or come close enough to have a temporary effect on the axial tilt.At this point I humbly ask that you simply remain open to that possibility for now.The Chandler wobble is extremely small compared to the wobble thought to be the cause of the precession of the stars and is not considered to be of any consequence to the idea I am putting forward.To avoid any cultural issues, making no claim of significants except as positional markers, I have opted to use the date December 22nd in all years as my marker for Northern Hemisphere mid Winter and the Southern Hemisphere mid Summer and June 22nd in all years for their opposites.Pictorial representation of the positions of the Earth, the Moon and the Sun at these dates:Notice the plane of the Moon’s orbit of Earth in the above pictures?This is the causes of the position of Sunrise and Full Moonrise to change positions on the horizon throughout the year, mapped and observed by ancient structures such as Stonehenge.What I have so far presented is widely accepted. Without an obvious cause to a matching change to the Moon’s orbital plane (for which I have found none to date), this alone, is enough to discredit the idea that the Earth’s axial tilt wobbles else it would render structures like Stonehenge useless for determining the position of the Sun and the Moon throughout the year after only a hundred years or so.All explanations for wobbling Earth’s axial tilt that I have, so far, been able to discover make no mention of any adjustment of the Moon’s orbital plane.In recent times, with the aid of technology such as the Hubble Telescope, we have gained a grand picture of our home galaxy.(3D Milky Way images generated from 3dgalaxymap.com It is believed that our Solar system orbits the Milky Way, taking somewhere between 200 and 250 million years to complete each orbit. Now 50 million years is a large room for error, so for the sake of simplicity I’m going to use the approximation of 200 million years for a galactic orbit. (Remember, I said I would use no complex maths.)Side Note: 200 Million years divided by 25,920 years for each completed Precession of the Stars gives us around 7,716 Precessions per galactic orbit.This is how most consider the 200 million year galactic rotation:It is pretty much considered the stars in the galaxy hold their places in relation to one another and the galaxy simply spins around just like a pizza. I do not agree with this way of looking at it as you will soon see.It is currently considered that our Solar System lies close to the galactic plane due to the Milky Way roughly dividing the night sky into two equal hemispheres and that the plane of the galaxy is approximately 60 degrees to the ecliptic (the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun).Some people believe that the Earth spends time both above and below this galactic equator. The idea, which I will get to very shortly, to explain the precession of the stars will also demonstrate how it is very likely our solar system travels above and below the galactic plane during every (25,920 year approximate) precession. Again, roughly around 7,716 times per galactic orbit.I am not making a pre Copernican Revolution statement with that claim, precisely the opposite. What I am about to offer is yet another aspect of the dynamic movement of our galaxy which I have previously not found mentioned anywhere else.In the next paragraph I will attempt to explain the movement within our galaxy that I think is responsible for the stars appearing to slowly rotate the Earth in the Precession of the Stars as well as causing the Solar system to move above and below the galactic equator.Consider this rough sketch picture:See if you can imagine the imaginary ‘axis’ along the centre of each galactic arm, represented by the two darker lines in this picture (This is the axis I call the Hammar Axis). All of the stars, planets and other stellar objects twist around this axis.Our solar system lays within a small section of galactic arm we have named Orion Spur or the Orion Arm. As shown in this drawing.The following diagram represent a cross section of the Orion Spur demonstrating the relationship between the Earth, Sun and other stars as the galactic arm slowly rotates (each disc representing an approximate 2000 year interval)The Pendulum lines in the above diagram are actually how a half rotation would appear but are used artistically here to demonstrate the constant direction of the Earth’s planes and the direction of the Earth’s axial tilt.Well that, my friends, is the idea of the Hammar Axis in a nutshell.As you can see, there is no need for the axial tilt to wobble around, nor is there a requirement for another object to interact with our Sun such as being part of a binary star system although this idea does not discount that possibility also taking place.I look forward to your responses both for and against it as well as any questions you may have. My intention is at best, to find the most understandable way to communicate the idea by ironing flaws in my description. I am also open to having the idea completely destroyed if I can be provided with an easily explained reason.~Namaste",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

wether food or intelligent opportunities moves or of course money rewarding you for whatever hard labor or beauty experience or that love thing you belief being everything, as a god that would never let you down and always surprise you of knowing you and seeing you totally



so



that is how you accept that positive is negative because you are puting yourself out of it while meaning the true positive only you which is you effectively aware there so you dont need any reference to positive to be, you handle your moves



but objectively you are the positive fact existing there and nothing else



and effectively you will never mean to hurt yourself as positive existing do

and if there is any objective reason to move you would love to be more positive existing and move your whole being fact forward



they say how poor people are usually very kind, well for true people like me it is good to know how the world changed about that



but that belief was due to positive truth too, when there is no money as the source of you being positive out of everything counting in your head your possessions and gains to feel well as existing fact, the poor are counting on themselves alone so they yell for what they cant accept and smile for what they are happy to exist about, until they repeat their reasons of smiles and stuck there as positive ones



the base is positive one of any free move or expression, and it is the same base of gods it is the nature of void absolute positive life, now the problem or the issue is what the sense is something else



go to bases man it is positive forever, throw that crap they sell about love it is just an extra nothing real or certain and is responsable of so many crimes



what is called love is the sense of full one life that he would move constantly as a whole and not parts steps to assemble

but that god who can see you from above totally if he can make you sense his presence to love moving fully he can also break you down and claim being free above you, you cannot say then that god is meaning to love him always so he can keep the positive income to yourself from where you define you existing, otherwise it is your fault from what he is judging you and educating you as the sense of his love to you

you cannot say objectively that, the only thing that you can say there is that you are pissed off for not being treated as positive existing and you are trying to find reasons that can justify that fact lost, because you are an objective positive existing fact and dont take pleasure in hurting yourself



truth is about positive one as base and then positive life as also positive one according to move reference being always positive more



positive existence is all in between that truth realsations, it is the existing fact where many things happen in the whole fact

you talk to yourself sometimes i guess you know how you bargain with things that are parts of everything, that is existing moves, daily balance work or the whole



and the goal is of course always the same reference that define the balance being positive fact existing, that is why you see bargains between negative and positive it means we are the same existing fact, so positive have full interst in being whole positive that is why it gives to negative what it can and as a same existence the cannals are open for exchange and supports



but like you knwo i am sure, existence is in different level dimensions a positive fact or true



i never judge who perceive their positive existence from what they gain wether money or pleasures or simple joys, on the contrary i support them mentally always, because it is right noone is suppose to be forced to love truth and be geniun move positive one, the sense of living existence is positive life not being one, we dont have to choose values and so on

we have to choose having fun and enjoying to move



so the issue is gods really, for what they mean the same and share with use that fact life opportunity, but they abuse their positions to leave nothing to us and enslave us to their gains in exchange

they nourrish negative ones that never mean positive at the first place to the reference of one no have any idea about void nature to make them rule on us between us and giving them a whole dimension above us so they can mess with as it pleases them to get something from living sense

when they are not to positive one base any fact existing



god and gods should save the bases always of positive one they know before meaning their lives through, and not abuse the rights of others existence by denying existence base truth and claiming that existence being only to their lives

they are responsable of void nature truth being their base but also the source of opportunities, it cannot continue like that with bigger fixing rules as it wish, we can speak of bigger of bigger frm the voice of void source till void source would break them to respect what they know and stop the lies market



if they want to give moeny and lives dreams it must be till the end sure wether from them or from the moving for



consider that post an original reply that is in the vogue of all lives sense, you cannot judge what i say, it is still my right to say about everything wahtever i want, i am an individual positive existing one and i am fully in my rights expressions



observe how people are being enslaved to positive source, because there is no existence life but of postive living sense, it says how positive is the issue for what it is the exclusive base



now that is my point let find out whre is the true positive source so we can have a base, you know before dancing and making spectacular shows about love and all that groove that dont last as nothing



and that is real truth to an extent that people are becoming possessors of positive source, knowing how it is better then to live by simply keeping money and enslaving others with, when it is the condition of present existing positive fact, all they must do is showing their money spent as having fun and prooving how others dont to consider them not existing and them yes

it is all responsability of god and gods in general that some followed the logics well to incarnate perfectly",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The worst of this is that one can actually go to the Masonic Temple nearby, sit outside on a night of a meeting and watch to find out that this kind of rash belief is simply untrue. It is so easily determined to be a lie that it astounds me that people still believe this stuff. If it is a night when both men and women are going in then it is an open lodge, and you could go in as well and find out that this is simply wrong.This belief that there is some terrible things going on in Masonic lodges is odd to me. Or within the O.T.O, especially as about 90% of the founders of this nation were Freemasons. Without the belief of equality in Freemasonry it is unlikely the face of this nation would be as it is today.We have a saying in this nation, ""Innocent until proven guilty."" However when dealing with freemasons, proof is not required. The worst innuendo and rumor however easily proven false is adopted among those who want to believe the worst in others. Skepticism and curiosity is lost, no speculation can be made that they might actually be what they say they are. They keep secrets that are not secrets so they must be bad, bad men who rape children.If you really want to see, then go and look. If all you see is what is on sites that repeat what you want to hear you will have no evidence, only speculation and guesswork. It isn't hard to get to know these people and to find that they are simply men who work together to benefit their society with charity.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks for the support, at least Inhale/exhale has admitted he is a skeptic and because of his admission there is nothing anyone can say will make him believe in anything.







Even if you filmed an actual ET craft flying over your house or an actual alien stepping off a ship,whatever that would look like, the skeptic would cry hoax, cgi, etc as they would neve admit they are wrong!!



Ignorance at the highest of highs.Everyone is a skeptic towards something.I am skeptical of the claims in your video thats all.Correct when you say there is nothing anyone can say that will make me believe in anything because nothing anyone says influences my beliefs and no one knows what my beliefs are,Bravo your learning to think logically.Learn what it means to be skeptical. ""the skeptic"" of what? Your videos? Aliens? Pink unicorns? everything? Skeptic of what?Just because I am of the opinion you have captured a plane and am skeptical about the honesty towards the way you present that video were are discussing, it seems you have concluded to know what I believe by adding the ""in anything"" part.I believe that will imply I do not believe in ET.I do. UFOs for people who say people deny they exist, I say that is not logical at all.A UFO is anything witnessed above ground that cannot be identified at the time of the occurrence so its labeled a UFO. it could be a shoe thrown in the air, until its identified as a shoe.The term UFO, I like to use for what its meant to mean and not confuse by hinting I mean ET.So being a skeptic and expressing as best I can what I am trying to get across is a must for anyone researching the unknown.Do you get it, its unknown, so one must be as clear as possible when researching unknown phenomena as what one person says and how thats interpreted by another can get lost in translation quite simply.These days I am under the impression when the term UFO is used, a majority of times here on these boards people actually mean ET.I just want transparency.A thorough investigation cant be done without all the cards being laid out on the table and they never will because someone will always have something to hide.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

before the movies I asked her what are some things to look forward to and she says that I might not like it because it will end off at a battle scene.



I was a little frustrated with this movie. If was told before hand that this movie is nothing like its predecessors I would have been a lot better off I mean from the action stand point. and I know after the movie the person I was with told that the next movie is going to probably have a lot of action, But the thing I don't get I am not understanding why this movie was necessary?? I mean it was so straight forward as to what you would guess is going to happen even for me a person who ha snot read the books,

146 pages is a lot of messages, enough for a book. I sort of agree with not wanting to read through all of it at one time in a pdf file.



You might have started a thread with the first message, and wait for responses, then add a new message every day allowing for questions and comments.



How does it happen that every time your Mom channels, the message is recorded? What is her proceedure? She has a set time for messages? They never happen at random?











Let me explain the process a little. She was born with gifts, just like the rest of her family. We all have gifts to a certain extent, including myself. Although, they're not as developed.Her impressive abilities began to manifest a few years ago, when the coup to take down Chavez, occurred in Venezuela on April 21st, 2002. She simply felt the need to write. After writing a few pages about the events and future of that country, she wrote the signature, ""Simon Bolivar"" at the bottom.I was out of town that weekend, when I arrived back in Miami, she showed me the messages. I was obviously skeptical, my dad did not believe her. My sister thought she was crazy. So, she decided not to tell anybody.We began to analyze the messages, and it clearly stated, whenever you wish to contact me, read ""Mi Delirio Sobre El Chimborazo"" One of Simon Bolivar's most acclaimed and powerful messages.She sat in the computer, I sat on the bed, and she began to read it out loud, two paragraphs into the reading, she began to change the tone of voice and started saying messages, from Bolivar.At the time, I just wrote everything I heard. I was a little concerned, since she expressed feelings of sadness and suffering on her body and voice, according to the tone of the message. However, I was not scared.Having this in front of my eyes, I was still skeptical. So throughout the middle of the message, I closed my eyes and shouted in my head real loud ""Simon Bolivar are you there"" (In spanish) (Mentally)To which my mom (Bolivar) replied, yes, I'm here.... Goosebumps ran across my body, and no doubt ever crossed my mind again about my mom's psychic abilities.Following a few episodes of this, I had the idea of channeling messages from great people in planet earth, like einstein or plato, or aristotle for that matter. I mentioned it to my mom, and she ignored my request. She has the gifts, but she's not into the 1800-psychic thing. About a year of these thoughts, I finally had the impulse of asking my mom to try to communicate with Jesus. Obviously, he's the most influential person to have ever stepped on Earth. I MUST MENTION, neither my mom, myself, nor anyone in my direct family, are of the catholic religion, or any religion whatsoever. We were born knowing about metaphysics, new age, but no religion. It doesn't fit in the new age believe. BACK TO THE STORY, after mentioning this to my mom, she replied, ""I'll try""So that night, she stepped outside, to the backyard of our house, and came back and said, I felt him, I felt his energy, he was there. *I smiled in joy*The next day, she just started writing. This happened for around 30 days, in a total of 13 communications, it started with her writing them on paper, then just typing them on the computer. As we read the messages along, we knew, we were onto something big. He states that these messages will reach humanity, and that our mission is to be there assisting those that need help in every corner of the world. So I decided to put up a website, obviously translate it into english, and give them to the world.However, the task at hand is harder when you find so much opposition. But I won't give up. And I'll be here for those that want to listen. I don't preach, I'm not religious, and I don't want anybody's money. I want humanity to evolve in LOVE!",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Eric zipped up his coat to his neck and pulled the hood over his head.Tiny snow tornadoes swirled around his feet as he brushed half an inch of snow off his windshield. A nagging negative feeling floated around in his gut like bad sushi that perhaps driving to his parent's place today on a whim for a surprise Christmas visit, perhaps wasn't the best idea.But seeing as how he had nothing better to do,and it had been a few years since he had been home for the holidays,he talked his gut into being quiet. His parents weren't getting any younger, and maybe this was the year they would stop grilling him over not being married yet to anything but his career. ""Gotta build the castle before I can share it with a queen."" He would repeat over and over to their inquisitions.He did a double take of the traffic from his view in the parking lot of the apartment building,and the steady flow on the main road gave him a sense of security that the roads were still good enough to drive the trip and that hopefully the storm would pass as quickly as it came.The three hour drive to his parents would be sketchy, but worth it to see the look on their faces.**********Annie brought a lunch tray out from the kitchen into the lobby where Fred was sitting on a sofa beside the Christmas tree, staring out the window at the heavily falling snow.He smiled at her, snatching half a grilled cheese sandwich and dipping it into a steaming cup of tomato soup.""Good thing we have nowhere to go today."" He said as took another big bite of the sandwich, and a trickle of soup dribbled down his beard.""I'm sure it will pass soon."" Annie spoke in between spoonfuls of her own soup. "" But it sure makes it a festive holiday.""She smiled at him with flushed cheeks, either from the warmth of the soup,or the flurry of activity all day. Why she almost resembled Mrs. Claus fresh in from the cold, he thought.She winked at him as she caught him looking at her. No matter what his thoughts were, he was smiling, and that was all she needed to know.**********Lynn's foot slipped as soon as her high heels hit the front step,sending her landing on her backside and her hand full of purse,keys,and coffee to go flying into the shrubbery.""Damn it DARREN! Didn't you salt the walkway?""Darren glanced back at her brushing the snow off her coat from his position beside the passenger door."" Yes dear, I did. But it's snowing too hard and covered the salt up."" He tried so hard not to smile at the spectacle of her, knowing it would be worse for him if he did.All she did was roll her eyes at him, and tip toe slowly towards the car, after grabbing her keys and purse,and abandoning the cup of coffee left splattered on the snow.They both climbed in the car and spoke not a word as Lynn backed out of the driveway and their journey began.Within minutes, the tire tracks disappeared under a new blanket of white.**********Karl took a long sip of hot coffee from his travel mug. The radio blasted and he sang loudly. Nothing could spoil his good mood today. "" Merry Christmas Karl!"" He said out loud to himself,and laughed maniacally.His route consisted mostly of continuously going over the main roads,with a few side streets at the end of town.There was still enough people hustling and bustling around,that it took very little effort for him to clear the road. A few drivers waved a thank you to him,and that was always a bonus.Every now and again some noodle head with a lead foot and a rocket up his muffler would tailgate him,and from his rear view mirror he could see the driver banging on the steering wheel.You would think they would be more grateful for having the road cleared directly in front of them. Didn't fizz on Karl though. He'd smile and yell as if the driver behind him could hear, "" HONK IF YOU'RE STUCK BEHIND A SNOWPLOW!"" That never failed to make him laugh.**********Maddy squirmed and wiggled in her seat."" Mommy I have to pee!""Serenity now, Michelle thought. ""OK, just around this corner is a gas station and we can stop there.""""Sally needs to go too."" Maddy spoke of her rag doll.""OK baby, almost there."" Michelle pulled into the gas station and quickly rushed Maddy inside.Safely back inside the car,Michelle started to feel uneasy. While inside with Maddy, the snowfall had doubled, as had the wind.She was half way to her destination,and it would be the same driving distance whether she continued on, or turned back. Knowing she was expected,she decided to press on, but slowly. Surely this was the worst of it, and she could still drive, albeit carefully.Maddy sang in the back seat, "" Jingles Bells, Jingles Bells"", over and over to Sally , her audience, as she made the cloth doll hands clap for her.**********After waiting patiently in the line up of vehicles, Eric finally pulled up to the speaker of the drive thru coffee shop."" Hello , my name is Amanda, Merry Christmas, how can I help you?"""" Yeah, can I get a large double, double please."" Eric was suddenly self conscious that his teeth might be chattering as the wind blew through his open window."" Sure. Will that be everything?"" Amanda asked in what he was positive was a phony enthusiastic voice.Glancing behind him at the sole car that had been inching it's way up the line almost as long as him,and the senior couple it held warm inside, Eric turned again to the speaker."" Actually , no that's not everything. Please be sure whatever the car behind me orders, that you charge me for it as well. Thank you.""""Will do sir! Please drive up to the first window.""Amanda smiled at him, as she handed him his coffee and change. Perhaps she wasn't being phony after all. Or perhaps his small gesture brought out genuine happiness in her. Either way, both made him feel warmer inside than the fresh hot coffee.**********The smell of Annie's baked ham wafted throughout the small house,and Fred found it increasingly difficult to occupy himself away from her. Back and forth he paced between the lobby and the whirlwind of activity outside,and the whirl of activity in his own kitchen. Dozens of cookies that were once cooling on racks, now rested neatly in decorated tins. Annie was finishing up their dinner of ham,scalloped potatoes,green bean casserole,and her best home made dinner rolls. She always made a lot of food,and leftovers were frozen for those days in winter when they wanted a hot meal, but the energy to cook it was absent.Fred snuck up behind her as she was rolling out the dough. He tapped his finger on the bread board, coating the tip with flour, and giggling as he swiped her nose with it."" Oh, you!"" Annie squealed, and chastised him,with a light slap on the arm. Then she kissed him, leaving half the flour from her nose, now smeared on his own face. Then they both laughed at the sight of each other, and Annie continued to make the rolls while Fred wandered back to the window, frowning suddenly as he realized he could no longer see the road, nor across it, through the steady falling wall of white.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

No. I see it too. We're just trying to determine if this reflection (car? vent? neck rest?) is possible to capture, outside Fiona's car.

This is the crux of discrepancy!



Many dispute it. Few wanna hang on to belief!

I am among the few rooting for the underdog = integrity!

Firstly, I'm very glad some folks have questioned the use of the iphone's gps data. I use a 'real' gps, and the altitude reading is *always* an approximation, and is only vaguely accurate if you have a LOT of satellites to triangulate from. But the same also applies, if to a slightly lesser extent, to the location data. Quite apart from the fact that it may have been using cell-tower approximations, the accuracy of the 'fix' is again extremely dependent on the number and strength of satellite signals.It's also worth noting that the 'assisted' gps system that the iphone uses, does NOT give substantially better precision than normal gps, and it only applies if the phone is getting both satellite and cell-tower triangulation data. (Now if you were talking about *differential* gps, it would be a different story, but the iphone most certainly doesn't have that.)I'm sorry, but to me, that GPS data is essentially worthless, especially given the exact same readings on 3 images, where one might assume the phone had simply lost the signal.We can SEE where the images were taken from, and there is simply no way whatsoever that you could use altitude data to see if the photographer was sitting or standing.For further information on how misleading claims like ""10 meter accuracy"" are:I'd suggest that if we did a genuine analysis of how much error range is likely to exist, you'd be talking many tens of metres in total. I'm *not* volunteering to do that analysis.Onto the reflection thingy..While it sorta looks like a car or van, the angles just don't add up, unless it is something other than a windscreen doing the reflecting. If you are looking roughly horizontally through a windscreen, you do NOT see cars.. just the dashboard and other stuff that is ~45 degrees down.I would strongly suggest that you take a look at the quite striking and unusual interior designs of the PT Cruiser, eg:It could be the silvery areas around the circular vent thingy, or simply something on the dashboard. But there have been several different iterations of that dashboard, so without knowing which one it's just wild guesses..",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What if they don't even ""fly"", they just bend space/time/reality and bring the destination to them, but from our view appear like they are moving.

I think C0le was onto something when he mentioned changing US policies, anything is better than the present ""Do as I say, not as I do"" policy.





Utah, Colorado and Wyoming sit on a massive fortune in untapped oil — maybe more oil than in the Middle East



Your eyes decieve you Koka. First of all the same resources you say can be found anywhere else in the world... It works both ways - if they are so common, suply and demand kicks in and ours are worth as much as everyone elses. IF anyone tries to isolate us, the US is capable of feeding it's own population and has the raw materials to exist without imports. And this brings me to another thing.The rest of the worlds economy rests on the shoulders of the US. Don't believe me? Well, take China for instance. Who do you think buys the things made by their low cost labor? The US accounts for roughly 20% of the TOTAL world economy! You can't just take away that 20% and say everyone will get along fine - they won't!If you were trying to imply that the US has no oil, well, think again.In response to the authors, thread I disagree with some of his assesments.First off, to say that in 10 years we would have trouble fighting ANYONE is just plain wrong. The technological lead the US enjoys has been built over DECADES of research and development. China (or the EU for that matter) can not hope to close that gap in just ten years.The US spends as much as the next 20 odd countries COMBINED on their military. So in order for anyone else to even make headway, they are going to need to spend MORE then that. Who can do this? 460 BILLION dollars can not be spent on defense by anyone but the US.Secondly, the author acts as if the US does not have any allies. Ever heard of NATO? It is the most powerfull military partnership in the world.Thirdly, he is wrong about the ME. Pulling out of there completly would only be viable if we had an alternate energy source to oil. Untill the day that we can find an equally cheap source of energy, not only should we NOT leave the middle east, but we should look to expand our influence over it.

No doubt there might be pretty ugly creatures out there, but I think it's possible some might look like some of us. Just like a secret society can blend in with the rest of us they could blend in.I guess you could include those that don't look enough like us to work with us daily, but enough so that the can blend in for a short period of time.For example you might find those types say deep in the mountains in the winter time out of the way far enough that they won't even run into backcountry skiers or snowmobilers. If they were spotted from a distance, such as by aircraft or a backcountry nut they world be dressed in a way that you couldn't tell they were alien as long as they had legs, torso, arms, head etc.Besides all the government control conspiracy stuff, I think they might just come here on vacation. I also think if they're similiar enough to live with us they might just decide to move here and keep their identy to themselves that could even be a way for them to modify our genes, by blending with us.Still though my biggest bet on where to find them is where you find travelers as it's where they could best fit in without being noticed.[Edited on 20-4-2004 by outsider]",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I was an agnostic for many years of my life. Not only in regard to the topic of God's existence (or non-existence), but on almost every single topic I was able to be. I would stay on the fence, claiming that ""I was just waiting for more evidence to surface or for strong personal experience to convince me before picking a side of the fence to jump over to"". But the truth, deep down as I am now discovering, was that I did not want toto make a decision when the fence was no longer there to use. In other words, I would use the fence as a means to ensure I would never be in the position to be seen as intentionally hurting, intentionally offending or intentionally judging another person because that was worse than not being able to clearly define my position. For a reasonable person, this is not an acceptable position.Please understand, I am not suggesting that waiting for facts, evidence and more credible details to emerge before committing to a position or fighting for it is bad or wrong, I am just saying that deciding to do these things for the purpose of avoiding being negatively judged by others is stupid behaviour. I have personally learnt this the hard way, and because of this my desire to utilise ""compromise"" (especially when it is the only option left) is difficult to channel into because I now almost see it as an exclusively ""weak"" position. My head, heart and soul know that it takes strength, courage, resilience, trust and a giant leap into unknown territory to achieve ""compromise"", so how could I still resist the idea of it being a strong quality?So, my dear agnostic friends, whether your agnostic views render you unable to state whether or not you believe in God's existence (or your preferred method of stating you don't know if it's even possible or not to determine whether God exists); or whether your views ""prevent"" you from speaking honestly on controversial issues like abortion, euthanasia or promoting equality of outcome, just remember: sometimes it is necessary to stay on the fence, but if you want to make a difference on a topic that is considered controversial and are faced with a decision to choose a side to jump into, TAKE THE JUMP! Because whether you are right or wrong, you WILL learn something valuable as a result. I guarantee it!

Im not uncomfortable with people who look different than me or dress different. Trayvons past matters because it shows that he was not an angel. That lends credibility to reports that he attacked Zimmerman. Stop making tnis about race and screaming racist at people who disagree. Youre better than that.



Tayvon's past matters only in that Zimmerman didn't know who Tayvon was and all his actions were based on assumptions.



Zimmerman was aware he himself had a gun. Zimmerman was stalking Tayvon. It is safe to say that Zimmerman meditated on this and thought about the possibility of using his gun. He no doubt thought of the possibility that the person was unarmed.Or maybe he didn't. Either way, you don't, or shouldn't just walk away from killing another person be it murder, manslaughter or self-defense.

edit on 25-3-2012 by SubPop79 because: (no reason given)



Of course he meditated it. Anybody who carries a gun for self defense has, or SHOULD have thought about the possibility of being forced to use it to put someone down. That doesn't make you a criminal, being prepared for the worst.What the whole point of this thread is, is to show that this Trayvon was not an angel, he was criminal. And was in a neighborhood that had a lot of break ins, and he was strange to the neighborhood.He was up to no good, anyone who denies that is sympathizing with this kid BECAUSE of his race. Which makes your equally racist.Do I agree with what Zimmerman did... Maybe not with stalking the kid, he is not a cop, leave that to the pros. But with defending himself, when being attacked by a stranger, most definitely. There is no way for Zimmerman to know if Trayvon was carrying himself or not, or what he was carrying. It is perfectly legal to defend yourself with deadly force is necassary, if you are being attacked. And I fully believe, until proven otherwise, that Zimmerman was being attacked. Not because of this kid's race, but because it's obvious that he was not angel, not because of his clothes or his color. But because of the information that is out there about him.If anyone attacks me, I am carrying legally, and I will not think twice to end your life if I think it's either me or you. I applaud this man for having the stones to do what most people will only talk about, and not have what it takes to pull the trigger when the time comes. I however do not applaud this man for going out of his way to put himself in that danger.This should not be an issue where the race card is played. Anyone doing it at this point is merely pandering to the lowest common demonimator, and hoping to bait people into an argument. This is simply an issue of someone claiming self defense, where the person who shot at least IMO PUT himself in that situation on purpose. Is that illegal? frankly I don't know. But there should be some sort of punishment here.Once again, if you are bringing race anywhere near this issue, you are just perpetuating the race problem in this country.

When Muhammad was challenged by the Jews and Christians to produce a sign, he received a special revelation from Allah.Qur'an 6:37-39, 36.

yes i heard about the ""jews against zionism"" they are insane minority.

you call israel crap? maybe you should look at your islamic animal brothers before you call somthing crap. and who is WE must deal with it? are you refering to the terrorist that you are? wanting to destroy a sovereign country? dont worry we will find you and take you out like your terrorist friends.





no no dont twist it... you said there was jewish suicide bombers. it has nothing to do with christians or abortions.





i searched and found nothing so enough with his nonsense.





we are not discussing their ability for doing this but their motives. i would take from your comment that you confirm the motives of the islamofascists atrocities.





they are extremists because their false prophet told them to kill every person that doesn't follow their beliefs. nothing to do with israel or america. muslims murdered and raped for this prophet long before 911.





funny but you describe the situation in Tibet yet no suicide bombers in tibet. why?

because Buddha preaches for doing good deeds and muhammad preaches killing.

Yes, Israël is crap. They are like South Africa apartheid. They are violating every UN resolutions, grabbing land by force, killing civilians, doing wars, doing torture, using illegal weapons... The scum of earth. The government, and the israelis who support this crap because they are blind by their religious faith, we can call them extremists too, as the muslims extremists.. but those in Israël have a higher density of extremism than all muslims countries.I just wanted to say that there's not only muslim bombers because you always bash muslims.Are you a troll? Seriously, you're in profound denial about 9/11.First, the motives of the neo-cons... War, money, imperialism, police state... a lot of reasons, read PNAC, it is written they need a pearl harbor event to start their program and the operation northwood, they planned 9/11 type of attack in the 70s against washington and blame Cuba for it.The motives of 9/11 by muslims? To hit the big superpower, to show that they are not incapable and that they are able to hit the one who oppress them right in the face.This is farking bullcrap. You say that have nothing to do with Israël and america, this have all to do with them. They are doing ingerence, they are putting dictatorships in place, making the muslims lives miserables so they end in being extremists. And they are not raping and murdering for the prophet... where do they do that? There is millions of muslims in the occidental world and they are not raping and murdering people.Not at all. In Tibet, first, buddhism is an ideology, not a religion so you can't compare them. Second, put christians in the same situation and they will be extremists as well. Anyway, the extremists are like not even 1% of the muslims so they are not a threat so stop the hype.You're using the word islamofascists and from what I've seen, all those who use it doesn't have a clue about what the real world is and believe all the US media muslim bashing propaganda.

100195,"My own New World Order eh? Well, I would need more than a country, I think I would actually need an entire planet.. What follows is a small extract from a screenplay project entitled ""The Hegemony of Reason"". It is a fictional account of a planet very much like our own that undergoes a transformation when the collective consiousness and will of the inhabitants gets manifested and merged with a visiting alien collective. The synergenic outcome follows:





Greetings and Salutations,



In approaching the view of this planet, objectively and after taking into considerable consideration of the state of affairs and condition of the planet in aspects of governmental policies, quality of life for the inhabitants of the planet, the paradigm of work, education, improvement, advancement technologically, spiritually and environmentally it had been determined that there is indeed a need for a Hegemony of Reason.



We are the Hegemony… We are one. We are many. We are legion. We are the voice of truth. We are the voice of logic. We are honor. We. Are. The voice. Of the people. We are. The Hegemony of Reason. We speak.





It has been observed that the current construct of corporate military industrial cartel overlay to governmental and social structure is overtly corrupt and short sided toward the majority that lie outside of the sphere of quasi-fraternal influence that includes the various under agencies of government and military and corporate influence.



The goals of the Hegemony of Reason include but are not limited to the advancement of the human species in all aspects including intellect, physique, technological ability, spirituality, consciousness, novelty, quality of life, and interstellar migration into deep space. Honor for the greater good and advancement of the species is the motivating factor, not material wealth or personal gain. This is universal toward all persons and personal comfort and high quality of life is emphasized above poverty and stagnation. This is simply a matter of reason and course.

Intellectual advancement is paramount. Educators are the most honorable of professions and instructors are held in very high regard. Motivational factors could include higher learning, the arts, personal luxury time and additional comforts of choice including access to all resources necessary to achieve the individual goals. It is logical that each and every individual shall be provided by right of existence the best education and quality of life possible. Honor and respect are paramount; and dishonor against another is the highest offence. This includes lies and deceit, theft and violence, and crimes against nature and humanity.



The logic of the hegemony has determined that there are enough resources currently available on the planet to sustain well over 20 billion individuals. It has been determined that the current level of planetary technological ability has been and is currently being misrepresented to the majority of the population by the corporate and governmental structure in control. The logic of the hegemony has determined that this structure will be dismantled and the compartmentalization of secrecy will be removed and every aspect of technological study and record shall be made available to every individual. In contrast to a competitive climate working against each other and guarding secrets, the climate will be shifted to a cooperative atmosphere where new discoveries are shared and resources are pooled together.





Materialism is based on supply and demand. Vanity is not true materialism as in the since of hoarding. Since there is enough supply for everyone to acquire a high standard of material outcome this soon becomes a non issue.

The logic of the hegemony has determined the money system to be flawed, constraining, stagnating, and irrelevant to the advancement of the species.

then there's this:



I have been up on aviation forums, and the general consensus is that this is one of the special long-range aircraft, and that it could go very, very far. The 777-200ER (""ER"" for Extended Range) was made for transatlantic routes. This is not your regular 777-200.





and this:



The distance between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing is 4353km/2350NauticalMiles. The distance between Penang and Diego Garcia is ~3417km/1845NauticalMiles. The official range of the 777-200ER is 14,685 km/7,930 nautical miles . Looks like The Powers That Be did their homework.



Since its inception, the 777 has established many distance and speed records including: On April 2, 1997, the 777-200ER (Extended Range) in Malaysia Airlines livery set a new Great Circle Distance Without Landing record—flying 12,455.34 miles (20,044.20 kilometers) from Seattle to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.





and this too:



Four days after a missing flight, a patent is approved by the Patent Office for maximizing dies on a wafer. 4 of the 5 Patent holders are Chinese employees of Freescale Semiconductor of Austin TX. Patent is divided up on 20% increments to 5 holders. Peidong Wang, Suzhou, China, (20%) Zhijun Chen, Suzhou, China, (20%) Zhihong Cheng, Suzhou, China, (20%) Li Ying, Suzhou, China, (20%) Freescale Semiconductor (20%) If a patent holder dies, then the remaining holders equally share the dividends of the deceased if not disputed in a will. If 4 of the 5 dies, then the remaining 1 Patent holder gets 100% of the wealth of the patent. That remaining live Patent holder is Freescale Semiconductor.



Who owns Freescale Semiconductor ?? Jacob Rothschild through Blackstone who owns Freescale. Here is your motive for the missing Beijing plane. As all 4 Chinese members of the Patent were passengers on the missing plane. Patent holders can alter the proceeds legally by passing wealth to their heirs. However, they cannot do so until the Patent is approved. So when the plane went missing, the patent had not been approved. Thus, Rothschild gets 100% of Patent once Patent holders declared deceased. Rothschild, you are an evil bastard.





Here's another:



This disappearance is a kind of personal statement (or maybe ordered statement). I hope that I am wrong.

I guess that just shows that Iraqi military leaders were planning on the post war insurgency to defeat the USA and its allies. The Iraqis army was fighting a delaying action to ensure the insurgency was organized to face the Americans in post war Iraq.Mayabe the Iraqis should have spend more time training and getting aircraft operational instead of waging a war of rhetoric . Mind you thinking was encourged by saddams regime.If Iraq had possessed chemical weapons they may have used aircraft as a delivery system.Should a miracle happen and Iraq becomes a stable democracy an air force will be needed to defend the country against its nutty neighbors.

Perfectly legal citizens are now going to be required to show their ID to law enforcement at any time they are asked to. This goes against everything we stand for. Regardless of whether this law is meant to target illegals, the fact remains that citizens who are here legally and may even have been born here, will also be required to show ID when asked to.



A police officer cannot ask for identification unless you are reasonably suspected of committing a crime. Looking foreign is not a sufficient reason to accuse someone of being here illegally and then require them to prove their innocence. Innocent until proven guilty.



It is the accusers responsibility to prove guilt. This law completely flips this concept on its head. Essentially, it is saying to the accused, ""I think you're here illegally and now I want you to prove to me that you aren't, if you can't do this, I will take you to jail and charge you with a crime"". This is not how our justice system works.



It is not a law to carry ID in America and the only time we are required to show it is to show that we meet the requirements for certain privileges such as driving, buying alcohol/cigarettes, owning firearms and of course in situations to prove you are who you are, but you are not required to show the proof. Of course, if you want money out of your bank account, your going to show it.



The argument of whether the constitution applies to illegals or not is neither here nor there for the fact that law enforcement will inevitably be asking natural born or documented citizens for their identification because they don't ""look"" American or have the ""proper"" accent.



With all this said, I will be much less bothered by this law if it uses strong language that makes it absolutely clear that there must be sufficient evidence for an individual suspected of being here illegally other than the fact that they speak a different language or look foreign.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Only if you go with the theory that the Russians would just shrug off the loss of umpteen million people, which is absurd.



The ""Great Patriotic War "" left huge scars in the national psyche - nobody wants to go through that again. The UKs nuclear arsenal might not be able to obliterate the USSR entirely, but it would effectively finish it.



GNP is generally quoted a a lot higher than the UK per capita.



I'm talking about Swiss culture, which you seem to have missed. Going right back to the federation of the Cantons they have had a highly colelctive view of defending the population - even now they have virtually no standing army, it's all citizen-based.



Their civil defence program is an extension of the idea that responsibility is shared out all the way down to the very lowest level of individual houses, each of which is required to have a shelter. You can't introduce that sort of culture overnight



Crucially also, Switzerland is determinedly neutral and is never going to be the target for a nuclear attack.



There's a big difference between being ready for fall-out when France get blasted to having to take hits on Geneva and Zurich - either of which would be obliterated by a single direct hit.



..which would be completely different to the Swiss model. The point of their system is that the shelters are integrated into buildings and costed as part of them. You don't need separate buildingsd or land for shelters.



In each of those cases, one side might have responded to an apparent first strike fromt he other side with a 'retaliation' which would have been seen as a total surprise first strike.



Because they couldn't. There is no meaningful civil defence against a multi-megaton strike, as was repeatedly proven.



Your fantasy of evacuating everyone to 'a safe place' is just that



- a fantasy. Even if it were possible, anywhere you evacuated the population to would itself simply become a target.



And if you think that reducing deaths from (say) 20 million to (say) 10 million is something that would be applauded...I think you're crazy.

Civil defense is no more practical or impractical against a single twenty megaton warhead than it is against 10 750 KT warheads which could be carried by other versions of the SS-18. In fact a modification of the SS-18 with 18 - 24 550-750 KT warheads were considered ( it was practical) but they apparently decided that that was putting too many eggs in one basket. if you will.The most serious consequence of the single twenty megaton burst is that the damage will be more concentrated and shelters in the near vicinity far more likely to be destroyed.The United States would have destroyed Moscow any ways. I am not aware of any means in which the Russians could have saved Moscow with or without British nukes. If they could not evacuate the large majority of Moscow residents or make sufficient shelters for them the British 'detterrent' would have been bouncing rubble while still leaving Britain completely undefended and now a aggressor state.It also showed that nation what it could survive and what must be done and considered to bring about such survival. This is why the USSR absolutely had no protect it's citizens as any measure short of that would have resulted in more unrest and disassociation. The Uk's nuclear capacity could potentially be easily be countered by Russian active ABM defenses; the UK just lacked the economic means to make sufficient warheads and delivery vehicles to ensure even the destruction of Moscow . To suggest that the UK could have effectively 'finished off' the USSR presumes a second strike after a US strike were very effective.I think it was around 10-15% so i could understand if Britain had 10-15% less shelters ; maybe if they didn't build the carriers, dozens of warships and ballistic missiles submarines a passive defense could have been 'afforded? Why do you keep insisting that we should sleep with machine guns next to the bed but leave the house unlocked? Doesn't it make more sense to secure one's country first before starting to invite retaliation or arms races by building strategic weapons? MAD indeed.So did Greece, Sparta, Rome and every other state which made a distinction between citizens and slaves. The Swiss have no standing army? Where do they send the conscripts then? Do they just camp out for a year and eat whatever the Swiss does or do you need a comparative large scale infrastructure to accommodate that many citizens per year? How can you say that the Swiss can afford conscription but the UK for instance can't?No but apparently you can take tens of billions of dollars from the British public coffers and build massive amounts of offensive weapons while the culture never liked that either. You don't think the British government could have enforced shelter preparation ( the Swiss after all didn't start building air raid shelters in medieval European times) with less public outcry than taking all that money from things that could not protect Britain?So they are so well prepared despite being not even targeted for nuclear attack while the UK that is isn't prepared at all? Can you explain how that is?There is a big difference between throwing your hands in the air and faking premature mental and physical death for lack of the mental capacity to consider your survival/defensive options. Basically your advocating that the Possum carries neon lights and sirens so as to best attract attention from far far larger predators while refusing to change it's survival strategy of playing dead.Some are but not everything is and not all of Britain is built on flood planes either. Why must you insist on finding reasons not to do anything? The point is that some areas are harder to defend than others and this have ALWAYS been the case. The French could build the Maginot defense line in the 20's but clearly we should just surrender to anything more dangerous than a 500 pound bomb....In non of those cases were their any reason to suggest that such was in fact happening. Singular missiles do not win wars ( or even a ballistic missile submarine) and massed all out strikes ( battle simulation tapes/planet alignment ) do not take place in political vacuum. You are again presuming that a war could break out at any moment during the entire cold war which just isn't the case. Wars didn't even break out during the Cuban missile crisis, Korea, the Berlin Blockade or similar events where both sides had basically brought their strategic and conventional forces to far higher levels of readiness.Never proven as there never was a war. Hiroshima and other nuclear tests showed that even small scale preparation with cheap shallow buried defenses would be sufficient to save the lives of the many tens of millions in cities that would have otherwise died. We are talking about burying tubes of steel in the garden here so integrated basement defenses is on a whole different level with much greater potential to save lives and maintain them in safety.I never said everyone. That was suggested by authorities who refused to defend people in place. Evacuation should at best be part of the plan but sheltering in place is far cheaper and economically more sound. To evacuate everyone far from their communities and away from industrial capacity is a desperate strategy for an unprepared people.Because you refuse to acknowledge the limitations of information gathering by the various means employed. Satellites would go the way of the dinosaur within the opening hours and might be largely gone before the nukes ever start flying. If the population is properly dispersed to even shallow covered trench defenses the USSR would have to expend the majority of it's strategic weapons just to ensure a few million added fatalities while the US gets a free hand against the USSR.There is no fantasy in preparation and defense and that is why the USSR and other nations invested so much in it. The USSR could have built a few more nuclear weapons with which to intimidate Britain but it chose to invest massive resources ( labor and financial ) in the passive defenses that would ensure that what their ABM defenses could not stop their citizens could be protected from. The Same conclusion were reached by commissions consisting of generals back in the US but basically they were politically defeated and their active working missile defenses dismantled so as to not 'provoke' Russia into building even more nuclear weapons. That's basically what happens when you trust politicians to fight your wars for you.Well the casualties in the US might have been as high as 150 million in the 80's so yes, every ten million saved is something quite worthy of applause. I think not preparing defenses while you build weapons is crazy. I mean digging trenches in wartime is clearly just for show as they don't save lives either? I sure saw a manual where they claimed that bullets were now so dangerous and plentiful that trying to hide or presenting a smaller target was just wasted effort. When the artillery shells land you can just as well stand up cause your going to die any ways.I wish i could understand the minds that come up with these strategies of alternating inaction ( no passive defenses) and shear aggression ( build weapons of all kinds including nuclear) which are supposed to best defend a small nation with relatively high population density. You would think having so little to lose would inspire the creation of deep shelters but you would apparently be wrong.Stellar",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
331301,"Over my lifetime, what I have witnessed is a concerted effort by corporate interests to destroy all sense of community and structure in everyone,s lives. We have been turned into nomads, who must deal with constant economic upheaval, which for most means at the very least changing jobs every so many years. This can often lead to periods of economic hardship and all the stress that goes with it, possible relocation of one's home, sometimes destruction of ones family, and always a termination of a great number of relationships that you have developed with others.



The concentration of business activities in suburban areas artificially drives up the price of homes to the extent the couples must take on huge amounts of debt in order to buy a home, which forces them onto a tread mill of debt that completely undermines any sense of independence. Work hours are also artificially extended to to keep employees always scrambling to justify their jobs. Women as well as men are forced to join the system in order to meet the high home prices. This greatly reduces ones home life, ones ability to develop relationships outside of the work environment, and ones ability to maintain the relationships you manage to forge. Mostly, it reduces one's independence from the system.



The constant layoffs typical of most corporate work environments create a poisonous environment of mistrust. All too often the people who manage to survive the longest are people who concentrate on the politics, who are essentially willing to do whatever it takes to survive in what is essentially a cutthroat corporate environment. This means that the survivors are even more isolated than the people whose lives are being constantly turned over by the layoffs. While corporations often talk of team building, they do not want strong teams to be built within the corporate structure. Experience has taught me that the nature of corporate or institutional organizations is to eliminate any groups that form strong bounds, and thereby become a force within the corporate entity. Effective groups, while being highly efficient and capable of producing amazing results, are a threat to the corporate entity, and these types of organizations are always willing to sacrifice efficiency in order to sustain the status quo. It is the nature of the political environment in which they exist. This seems to be typical of any large institution.



Then there is the rat maze of suburbia itself. The streets and neighborhoods are set up by control freaks whose goal is to force traffic through certain check points. Drivers are forced into loops with limited exit points. The reasons for this serve many purposes.



First it makes us much more susceptible to police stops. The numerous restrictions in where we can or can not go force us to constantly run through invisible mazes. We often get trapped and forced around these loops more than once in order to successfully navigate them. These mazes are of enough complexity that we have to learn these areas before we can successfully navigate them with out errors. Any error we make provides a reason for authorities to stop and detain us. Under the guise of public safety we have all been made criminals for the mere act of making a mistake in a split second decision, while trying to navigate through the numerous mazes that trap us.



Second it cuts off our routes of escape. All those movies where is shows the masses of people stuck on the interstates, that is no accident. They have us trapped, and they want us to know. Get a map of any large population center. It is amazing how few avenues of escape from these areas exist. What you will see is that most of the ways out have been blocked.

The Day of Fear -



July 22nd, 2009 EVENING – Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu goes before the people of Israel with an urgent address: “Good evening. As Israel and the world is well aware it has been the position of this nation that Iran cannot be allowed to possess nuclear arms. I have worked with international partners in the United States and Europe to peacefully negotiate an end to this crisis. Iran possessing these weapons presents a clear and present danger to Israel, the United States, and yes the entire civilized world. Evidence has been brought to light in the last 48 hours which indicates that Iran is weeks if not days from becoming a nuclear capable nation. The time for negotiation and talk has expired. The lives of all Israel citizens are threatened and this threat cannot stand. I am asking the citizens of Israel to prepare for what is to come.”



July 23rd, 2009 DAYBREAK – CNN – Breaking News......Early reports are coming in...hang on...yes, okay....CNN can confirm that an air attack is underway in Iran. It appears that the Israeli Air Force has struck a fierce blow within the nation of Iran. No comment from the White House at this time. We will be following these events as they break....



Attack +2 Hours – CNN – Israel is claiming a complete annihilation of the nuclear weapons program as well as the destruction of numerous military bases. Iran has denounced the attacks as unprovoked and vow a swift reprisal. Reports from around the world indicate that Russian military forces have been moved to the highest state of readiness. This shocking move has led to many European nations moving into a defensive posture as troops are being called up.



Attack +6 Hours – White House – An Address from the President of the United States Barack Obama - “The events of the last few hours have sent the nations of the world into an all out military escalation, which, if left unchecked could lead the world down a dangerous path. I have been in communication with a number of nations including Russia, Israel, Iran, China, and others. During these discussions we have agree to a progressive scaling down of tensions. The attacks initiated by Israel were not.....wait...(secret service rushed in and grabbed President as screen goes black). CNN – we are being informed that the President has been moved to a secure location as a precaution only, we repeat, this is a precaution, CNN is being told that an attack on DC is not underway.



Attack +6 Hours 15 Minutes - Telephone rings in Tel Aviv. Are you prepared to do your service to Allah? Yes. Detonate the device.



Attack +6 Hours 30 Minutes – CNN....oh, oh no. new reports now and I,...It appears and this is just in, yes a nuclear event, a detonation has occurred in Tel Aviv, I think we have video. This is new video just coming in. (Cuts to video of mushroom cloud rising over Tel Aviv). And now we have to hope that something can stop the horrors of this day. I just don't know what to say.....



Attack +7 Hours – Russian press release – The nuclear attack on Tel Aviv is a horrific terrorist attack. The world must come together to end terrorism in all its forms. Russia is ready to send relief supplies and aid as soon as possible. Russia is shocked by this attack and states that it is confident Iran did not authorize or provide the nuclear material for this attack. Russia states that it stands by its ally nation of Iran and states that a nuclear attack on Iran would be considered an attack on the people of Russia.



Attack +7 Hours 30 Minutes – The US and Israel hold secure teleconference from the most secure locations deep below the surface of the earth. During the conference heated debate ensues with Obama staunchly against any form of response, instead arguing for a cooling off period to prevent a nuclear holocaust. During the discussions this CNN report flashes in.....”now new reports out of Iran, reports that the western city of Mashad has been wiped off the map by a nuclear attack from Israel. CNN cannot confirm the attack at this time.” In the teleconference Israel states that they launched no attack and that this is a set-up to provoke Russia into attacking them.



Attack +9 Hours – All out nuclear war ensues. Israel realizing that it has been set-up launches 30% of their arsenal at Iran and 50% at Russia with over 10 warheads aimed for Moscow. Just minutes after the nukes have been launched over 100 nuclear warheads rain on Israel destroying the sacred land. At this point with Obama's hand forced he launches a full scale nuclear attack on Russia. Bombs fall on all the major cities of Europe, Russia, and the United States. The US missile shield deflects 35-40% not nearly enough to prevent complete destruction.



Attack +24 Hours – China, India, Austrailia, and Japan release a joint message to the remaining world. The horrors of the past 24 hours will never be repeated, relief operations are to begin immediately. The leaders call for a nuclear free world, they call on the remaining governments to help the people who remain in the war torn nations.

386669,"I searched in different threads about this argument and found nothing really related to my considerations.



My point is: is it possible that we think light is the fastest thing in Universe only beacause light is the only ""tool"" we have to see the whole Universe?

What struggled me was the fact that we cannot know what is really out there because of restriction of light speed.

Our observation point is like in a bubble, the more we see further in astronomical observation the more we see the past, we don't see what really is there at the time we are looking at.

This is a limitation due to our way of observe, because it is based on how much time light spend to travel till we can see it.



I found some thred here on ATS about the speed of thought and I have to share an experience I had some years ago.

I was in a chalet with some friends and we were playing card games after a long day. I was really tired and felt aspleep.

I dreamed about a lot of things, I can't properly remember because I didn't wrote them after awekening but I remember it was a very long dream, with an intricated history, so much intricated that, when I woke up, I immeditely said to my friend, who where still there playing card, that I had a great dream.

They looked at me astonished and said: ""You had a dream? you just closed your eyes for ten seconds!"".



Now, light travels at 299 792 458 m/s, and in ten seconds travels 2 997 924 km... Earth distance from Sun is nearly 149 597 870 km. So i had the time to dream a complete story before light coming from Sun reached the Earth!

My dream, in my dream-time, was far way long than 8 minutes, wich is the time light from sun travels before reaching us. Doesn't that means that my body, projected in my dream, moved faster than light, incredibly faster than light?



If we stop at it we could think that speed of thougts is way way way too faster than light.

But do we know how to describe the concept of speed of thoughts? the speed tells us how much time we need to reach a determined point.

The speed of thougt doesn't let us reach any point, it is likely a parallel kind of speed. And maybe this speed is valuable only in a parallel Universe, with a completely different structure.

I mean, let imagine a Universe where things are not seeing thanks to light but only by the ability to thought. In this hipotetical Universe nothing will be faster than speed of thoughts.



We base our observation on light, and speed of light is only reachable by photons. Maybe if thoughts are the way of seeing things nothing would be faster than thoughts.



If this kind of Universe really exist maybe we too are part of this Universe, because we have the ability to ""create"" thoughts. The same way the stars have the ability to ""create"" light!

328397,"Well isn't this a heated discussion. After reading the first 10 pages I finally pushed the ""Post Reply"" button, I really didnt want to read the rest of the pages because I assumed they were just the same posts over again.

Now, that being said; I'm not sure I can pick one side over the another on this issue.

Both sides have good points, although, the way they are presented is idiotic at times.

So anyway, here is some rambling from me to this issue, if you dont care then please, skip. Otherwise I might waste your time and that would be bad.



""Piracy"". A nasty topic in a way, almost like talking about religion or sports. First thing I'd like to remind everyone is that while making an argument and/or debating with someone about an issue, namecalling is childish and frowned upon. Seriously, if your only argument is ""lol ur a thief"" then you'll look like an idiot. Then again, if your only argument is ""but dem fat kats has lot of money i dont make a change!1"" then you're not any better.

Now that I've probably gotten most of the people pissed off, let's move on.



Personally, I use torrents. One thing most people fail to see is that services like the pirate bay don't actually do anything illegal - they just provide information on how to get data. You cant blame the guy who made the highway for the actions of another guy who robbed a bank and used the said highway to get away, can you?



Now, to the famous ""justification"" part - The reason I use torrents is simple, there actually exists some TV series that I want to watch but I have no way available of doing so. I dont live in the US, but I like to watch some US tv series, like..House.

Now, I could wait 5 years to see it in here. (Not even kidding, they're airing house in here and last time I checked it was season 2.) Ok, I understand if someone is going to yell ""THEN YOU SHOULD JUST WAIT 5 YEARS!!1"" but..do I have to? =(

Ok ok, seriously though, I choose to download a new episode of house whenever one is available because it is the only way for me to see it.

Sure, there's hulu right? Well..sure, except that it doesnt work in my country of residence. I would give it a try if it did work in here, even if it has ads. So, am I a horrible thief now because I'm watching a TV series I would otherwise probably miss completely, and thus I would provide no profit to the company who makes it anyway.

Well..I like to think not. Then again, I dont really care if people think I'm a thief, it's their opinion.

I have to admit though, I dont like if people are profiting from sharing those files. Now, thats just abuse in my eyes. Making profit using other peoples work. Then again, if you keep an information database that lot of people use, that creates traffic. So, I guess it's understandable to have a banner or two in your site to offset the hosting costs.

So, as long as the sharing of the files happens freely and no 3rd party makes any profit from it - I'm OK with it. Because some people actually do things like this:

Download a CD - if it's good, they'll buy it.

Download a movie - if it's enjoyable, they'll buy it.

""Yay"" for everyone, right? Well, Not exactly. Not everyone is like that which brings me to the whole reason I'm posting anyway..

I'm curious about something and hope you'll share your opinion with us:



Do you think that the manipulation you claim is current in broadcast media holds true for print media?

Looking forward to your responses.

How best to answer this?..... Let me start with a little history.... I was born in the late 60's, raised during the 70's, lived it up in the 80's, became a father in the 90's, raised a family in the 00's, and now unfortunately divorced in the 10's!I state all of that as a means of context only. I think understanding context is very important when asking someone their opinion. I'm not some bored punk on summer vacation.As far as the print media goes... they were the pioneer's of manipulation and dis-information. Print media is way easier to manipulate than media that requires video and audio! The company that I work for also owns a couple magazines, that you can find on many newsstands, and I could tell you stories about thier practices that would crumble any hope you ever had in print media.When did it happen?

Excellent observation, I've thought much about your statements. However, I'm unsure of your meaning in the following, ""That means, it doesn't sell out its own people to what some would feel to be a ""greater cause"" usually masked under the cloak that ""they are trying to help"" when they had caused the disturbance in the first place - """"We cannot always be accountable for each individual's actions with the extent of our awareness.

Sometimes there are time periods on certain planets that they live in trash so deep that they are barely living.In these cases it is prefered for us to clean up our own planet, just as a body would recover from an open wound. Ultimately, we are all responsible for the way life is on our planet and across the Universe and beyond. To place blame on another race for setting in motion the events which caused so much trash on our planet to pile up is irrelevant because we all at one point in time or another partook in the planet's current state.It is like yelling to the Universe, ""WHY ARE YOU PICKING ON OUR PLANET, Eh?""No one at this time like you said wants to take responsibility for the current state of this planet, yet daily do more harm than good with their actions being entirely self-centered.

Time to share another of my experiences. ^_^



In 2008 I bought my first car (a Mazda3, great car. =P).

One of the first thing I wanted to get for my car was one of those little angels people put in their cars (hang from visor or stick to dashboard).

However, I figured a friend or family member would eventually give one to me as a gift, and that would make it even more powerful. (Cheesy I know. I'm like that. ^_^)



So, roughly a year later, I hadn't told anyone this but was still hoping for one as a gift.

Well, one day I was visiting my parents in Quebec, and my sister drove from Montreal with my nieces to visit as well. She had to get off the highway due to a bathroom emergency (if you have kids, you know this too well. Lol. It happens).

Well, she got somewhat lost trying to find her way back to the highway, and stumbled across a new-age store. She decided to stop by and pick up a few gifts for us, since I hadn't seen my sister in years at that time.



She picked up a little angel for me that said ""Protégez mon frère."" Which means ""protect my brother"" in french.



That's when I told her I'd been wanting one of those since I bought my car, but figured I'd get one as a gift someday. So we laughed and life went on. (I still have this angel to this day, still in my car. ^_^)



Roughly a year later, a normal day at work, I had a little moment. I often look at something in a way that just makes me smile; whether it be a tree that looks like its smiling, or two birds talking to each other or whatnot. Simple things.

Well that morning I was holding the angel and smiling, reminiscing. Then i noticed something quirky: the way I was holding it, my thumb was covering part of the 'N' from the word ""mon"", making it look like an ""I"", so that it read "" Protégez moi"", which means ""protect me"".



So I smiled and thought ""well, that's a sign. Guess I'm protected today."", and I went about my day.



That night, there was a heavy storm, tornado watch, strong gusts of wind, and I was driving up to see my brother.

Well, I got in a bad accident, and honestly should've ended up at the hospital or dead. Driving 90mph, with worn out tires, hit a massive puddle while a big gust of wind shoved the car; my wheels seriously locked and I was headed towards a hard concrete median wall.



Somehow I managed to do a 180° turn while drifting forward, and grind the tail of my vehicle against the wall to safely come to a stop (much better than hitting the wall or spinning off into traffic).



Turns out 4 other cars spun out like I did in the same puddle and ended up much worse than me. One of them saw me pull off the maneuver and was just in shock with his jaw dropped open. All he had to say was "" wow.... I saw that! I don't know how you did that. Gyou got lucky as hell"".



It isn't too far fetched to assume I was protected that day, and they let me know in advance thru the angel figure.



Well, that's my story. A bit of a long read, I know. Hope ii didn't bore you too much with it.



Also on a side note: I was very stupid to be speeding in Bad weather with worn out tires.... Very stupid. Don't ever do this.... Take care of your car, and drive safe. Always.

I could've been seriously hurt, or couldve hurt someone gravely.f

edit on 28-11-2011 by Jwest06 because: Added forums.



This isn't a new idea, it's been done many times before. However, in the past it has failed because of a lack of follow-through. If you wish to see the idea that follows become a reality then it will be because YOU made it so. You took responsibility, did one step at a time, and accomplished the goal.The idea being proposed is to start a commune for like-minded individuals. What for? A simpler lifestyle, organic food, you know, the real food that you're actually supposed to put in your mouth hole, and a place for spiritual freedom is the desired goal. Where at? Peru, because the cost of living is cheap along with about everything else, but the major reasons beyond that I'll be going over in a minute.This is a call to all the people who aren't satisfied with the American dream or the western way of life. Let it be understood that you do not have to participate in the aforementioned bull #. I repeat, no bueno. Let's face it, the world has become if not remained a place of eternal despair. This is the biblical hell folks.You can watch documentary after documentary and keep piling up knowledge, but all your going to find is people suffering. That's what's being documented. Last night I was watching ""Our America With Lisa Ling"" and shed a tear over some black man that I didn't know who couldn't be with kids because he got caught up in a never ending cycle of the prison industrial complex. That man is my brother (no relation haha) and I don't want to see anyone suffer.Seeing the same ole same ole over and over again is not filling me with hope (what happened Obama?). I have zero sympathy for the cops and other evil #s perpetuating this nonsense and would wish them only death. Allowing them to live and change (Obama...) is not realistic. However, I am not a one man army nor am I trying to organize any bloody revolution. Doing anything of the sort on my own would result in suicide and result in no change whatsoever.So what's the alternative? Heaven. I questioned what Heaven was to me and came to find out it wasn't a very complicated concept. Tripping my ass off on the edge of the jungle with souls like Terrence McKenna or Timothy Leary is really all I need to sustain my bliss haha. But furthermore, let's get sidetracked and delve into the notion of inner peace for a minute.In the western world, we hate boredom with a passion. People will come up with the craziest ideas ever just to escape it. This is in complete contrast to inner peace. Inner peace, simply said, is wanting nothing and having everything. Those who plug the holes of boredom with every form of short-lived entertainment they can conceive of are not going to accomplish this feat, period.So, how would you find it? First, you might develop a little bit spiritually. Learn to want a little less through patience and the passing of time. Then, if you're really going for it, you might consider strapping on a blind fold, fasting, and sitting in silence with no external stimuli for a week. Sure enough, after a while you'll stop being bored, I assure you.Back on topic after derailing to provide some clues as to what consists of being like-minded. For those who have ran like hell from religion and begun to find the answers inside themselves, you'll want to grab a sharpie and a map. On the map, locate Peru, and draw a line through the word, not the country. Now write in ""Heaven"". You're doing this because all things helpful to progress, cleansing your chakras, more specifically that third eye of yours can be found there.Real medicine, not eat this pill and experience 20 side effects worse than the condition the pill was supposed to alleviate but not cure, can be found there, legally, in small quantities. I direct you to article 299 of Peru's penal code. Read it, shed a tear, and smile, you've earned it haha. For those of us who want to live a shaman style of life, this is home, and as good as it gets.Goal one is to buy some land. With that land, depending on our pooled resources, we can build housing. Personally, I do not care whether I live in some variation of a tribal hut or a nice home (by most standards), being there alone is victory. Step two becomes farming the land and providing real food for the people living there. Step three is providing options for other people to come share in this lifestyle like that nice black man I saw in prison haha.Step three is by far the easiest. Filming and uploading day to day life will provide all the advertising we could need. The right kind of people will come without much questioning and the fundamentalist Christian type will be scared to death tucked safely 3,000 miles away. So there it is, you have the idea.This is the part that gets different from past experiences. You will not post, ""oh, that sounds awesome, sign me up"" and then forget about this a week later. Instead, we organize. We make a website, write articles on self-growth, get the word out. For the mean time, I will register a free forum were the ones interested can make their intentions known. You'll be able to discuss ideas and evolve this into something beautiful.Now, you have it all. I will return with the free forum link once I get one set up and post it below. The next step of business might be to make a name for this movement because brand marketing as we all know works. No leaders, this is anarchy folks. Everybody gets a say. Get excited, get erected, do what it takes to make yourself feel better lol.Oh, and before I forget, there's one last piece of business to discuss. 2012. Now I don't have a damn clue what's going to happen. I really don't. But the deemsters seem to be getting the same message that I can get behind. I've read at least 25 times, ""my elves told me the world was ending in 2012"" and half of those people didn't fully believe what they were told. Nonetheless, intervention on a mass scale is the only thing that's going to end this planetary suffering.If that intervention is mass death, so be it, still did the job haha. Other theories consist of ideas like the planetary alignment causing everyone's calcified pineal glands to function again like it was originally designed to before we drank mass quantities of fluoride or breathed in aluminum dust being dumped on us from above (*shakes fist at sky). In either case, this becomes somewhat unimportant to say the least and we had fun for maybe a month.But why give these deemsters any merit? Read trip reports. You'll learn that these people left logic behind to come to the same conclusions independently of one another. For instance, the idea that time does not exist or doesn't exist outside the individual is brought up a lot. This idea is in another place that is widely regarded as respectable, being quantum theory and other branches of science. If you look closely, you shall find that one psychedelic idea at a time is being validated in this field of science.With that said, my work is done for now. This message of hope is going out to at least three places: Above Top Secret, Shroomery, and the David Icke boards. If you wish to repost it elsewhere with the forum link that will be provided later, you have my permission and then some.Peace. Love.

44214,"Ten planets in our Solar System, eh ? I suppose that he could be counting Pluto and Eris. The OP seems to be suggesting that one of the dots represents our Moon, but I'm not so sure. I think that this would have been shown beside Earth, rather than as another dot in the line of planets.



Delta Orionis (Mintaka) would be a very unusual system in which to find an inhabited planet. It is 900 light years away, and the two main stars (a B2 spectral class giant, and a smaller, hotter O9 star) are 70,000 times as luminous as the Sun. That means that they are very young (since more powerful stars burn up their fuel much more quickly), so there is no chance in hell that intelligent life (or life of any kind whatsoever) could have evolved on any planets there.



However, it seems that the star in question isn't actually one of these two. It probably just appears to be close to Mintaka (as viewed from Earth). The diagram seems to suggest that the second and third planets are inhabited, and that there is also a double planet in the system.



Fascinating stuff.



EDIT: The position of what I assume is supposed to be the Orion Nebula has me puzzled. It should be below the three stars in Orion's belt, not above it. On the other hand, if the position is correct, then that would suggest that the belt star circled is actually Epsilon Orionis (Alnilam), which is an even more powerful supergiant star. The problem with this theory is that Orion's belt would then be at the wrong angle.....

True, that. It does appear that Judy and Wayne get their scientific ""knowledge"" from pop fiction, rather than any Berkeley Doctorate. Some of that has a more specific source, in particular the last section about the length of day on Zet2 Ret - 4. I can't recall the guy's name right off the top of my head, but he wrote about 90 pages or so I think of just that sort of tripe, going into great detail about what life was like on that mythical planet. As I recall, he claimed less light, purple plants, all sorts of odd things.Some of it comes from generic literature that I've not been able to track the source of.The initial identification of Zet2 Ret as the home of the ""greys"" from the Hill abduction came from a misinterpretation by Marjorie Fish of a star map Mrs. Hill drew by hand under post-hypnotic suggestion that she claimed to have seen aboard the alien craft during the abduction. If you take Ms. Fish's map and the one drawn by Mrs. Hill, lay them side beside and remove the lines which lead the eye into a pattern, the resemblance falls all apart, Furthermore, Ms. Fish cherry-picked the stars she included in her pattern based upon pre-conceived notions which I believe were erroneous in some particulars.As a matter of fact, the production of HER star map sounds an awful lot like the methodology Wayne Herschel uses to produce his!A fair discussion of that entire episode can be found in an article published in December 1974 in ""Astronomy"" magazine called ""the Zeta Reticuli Incident"". the replies to the main article by Carl Sagan and Steve Soter are very relevant, and are included in a reprint of the article, which was pretty popular at the time. A copy of the reprint - minus some of the diagrams showing the Atterburg interpretation of Mrs. Hill's map - is still available on the web. Stanton Friedman has a copy of it at his website for download.Being the disagreeable sort that I am, I've put together a PDF of the article with more included from the original discussion than Friedman's version, just for my own use. I've not scanned the Atterburg interpretation pictures to put into it yet, either. The astronomical information is somewhat dated, being 37 years old, but the discussion involved is still fairly accurate in the main, and is well worth the read for anyone interested. Here is a link to an html version of the article, not at Friedman's site.Note: looking through that page, I see where I came up with the 27.2 light year distance - that is actually the distance to beta Comae Berenices, which I believe matches the pattern in the original map far, FAR better than Zet2 Reticuli.

is that playing too fast slows you up.



By ""too fast"" I mean faster than you can play correctly.



Why? A variety of reasons.



One: you learn your mistakes, not learn from them.



Suppose you're trying to learn a really fast guitar lick. You play it as fast as you can, you get a few notes in and then stumble.



You do it again, you get to the same place, and stumble again.



You do it a third time, and now you are learning that mistake.



Two: you build tension into your playing.



Something I've learned from t'ai chi: muscles (or in this case, tendons) work in pairs. Consider your arm. You have a muscle to flex your arm (your bicep) and a muscle to extend it (your tricep). This is because all muscles can do is contract.



So if you're flexing your arm, any tension in the extensor muscle will be working against what you're trying to do. You'll be fighting yourself.



Speed comes from a combination of relaxation and accuracy.



Let go of the urge to be a fast guitarist and you'll get there a lot quicker. Aim for being relaxed and accurate and the speed will come surprisingly and unbidden.



I say this not as the fastest guitar player in the world, but as someone who's overcome the problems caused by years of bad practice to get to a reasonable state of competence.

I also believe the sun is 'warming up' and that chemtrails are being used specifically to mitigate the warming effect this is having on the earth's climate ...



It would be interesting to see a year-to-year break down in the distribution of monthly chemtrail activity as well.



The reason I suggest this is because last year ( 2008 ), here in Ann Arbor, I noted heavy chemtrail activity nearly every day during the spring and summer. They were making clouds every day. Then there would be about a 10-day lull and then it would start back up again ...



Remember, last spring is when we had all the 'three-thousand-year' floods in the mid-west ... I relate this very heavy springtime chemtrail activity with these terrible floods ...



You may not have enough samples to break it down 'year-to-year' , but still it would be very interesting to present your results if there are enough samples ...



I would expect to see an increase in the springtime frequency of chemtrail activity as the years move forward toward 2008 ...



In closing, now that we here in michigan, and I would wager the rest of the country are in the deepest, coldest winter in recent memory, with snowfall even in Hawaii, Arizona, and southern CA, I have seen almost no chemtrail activity whatever ... so, again, it seems clear to me ( and others, I would add ) it's being done to cool us down !!",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

They just say, NO, it's happened before, once in 1897, here is the link, it's just barely the record but it has happened, totally normal! PROVE we have record earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, wars...... It's all happened before, no big deal.......

And I'm sure you believe that global warming is also caused by humans?? Lets take a step into the real world. Now do you not think that if the comet was as big as what a lot of people claim and doing all this crazy crap that is claimed that the millions of amateur astronomers would be on this like flies on crap??As far as these earth changes I am going to call BS on it having anything to do with a comet, huge planet, proto planet, brown dwarf star or any of the other things people are calling it. You do realize that the earth goes through cycles constantly right? Like ice ages coming and going God only knows how many times in the lifetime of the earth.I read today that the comet is around the Astroid belt now common sense would say that since its almost in the inner solar system that if this thing was such a bad a$$$$ it would be reaking havoc on every planet that it has gone by.

For one thing, there are *always* mysterious stories of relatively unknown areas - deep forest, uncharted desert, the Antarctic, jungles, mountains, caves, etc. Unknown territory gives rise to scary monster stories. A valley in mysterious India would be a great setting for some sort of mystery.



One point that makes me skeptical of this tale is the notion that someone in 1890 recorded the ravings of a person thought to be either delirious or a lunatic. Somehow, even though no one believed this man's ravings, they were recorded for posterity and available 100 years later? Not likely. I find it difficult to believe that *any* record of the man's treatment and death would survive for 100 years.



But OK, let's say it's all true. There is a host of natural explanations that don't involve any unknown forces or entities. The first thing I thought of (from the original story) was radiation poisoning - the guy's burnt, hair fell out, etc. Maybe... but the other guys didn't fit that pattern. What does sound likely is that there could be some sort of toxic gas that accumulates in the region.



In the US, there have been cases of sewer workers who descended into unventilated manholes and were almost immediately overcome by hydrogen sulfide gas, dying within a minute or two. In one such instance, two men died immediately. Another one or two tried to rescue them, and also died. There is nothing in these reports about ""snake-like movements"", but it is entirely possible that the stricken men had convulsions before they died.



At Lake Nysos in Cameroon, carbon dioxide was suddenly released, forming a dense, low-lying cloud that killed over 1500 people during the night. Carbon dioxide is heavier than air, so it stays close to the ground.



This valley in India may be near a volcanic region, where gases can be released. However, it needn't be volcanic activity. Decaying vegetable and animal matter would also release hydrogen sulfide, as well as methane and other gases.



Without a whole lot more information - including such things as the location of this valley - there isn't much to work with. But so far, nothing in the story requires any extraordinary explanations/",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1. Somebody seemed to think I was saying that if it gives off a mushroom cloud it's gotta be nuclear- NOT what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that IF it's not anywhere close to the payload they're talking about, but still has that yield and the attendant mushroom cloud (which I've previously pointed out you will get from just about any really large explosion) then it's not your run of the mill conventional explosion.

On the otherhand if that yield comes from a fairly large bomb, then there's little reason to suspect that it's nuclear.



And to kick a dead horse for disturbed deliverer- .7kt isn't much. The smallest nuke we've ever put out was the W54 warhead- selectable yield from .1 to .2 kt, used on the ""Davy Crockett"" Recoiless Rifle Projectile.



The big question is, what size of weapon are they getting this roughly .7kt from. (if that's even it's actual yield- again, we only know what we're told in this regard)

It might not only be a matter of smaller yield, but greater efficiency (and therefore reduced fallout).





I'm not saying FOR SURE that it's nuclear, and I'm not saying FOR SURE that it's not.

396840,"I like this article from 2008 that puts perspective on both scientific theory and gloom and doom environmentalists, politicians etc; and goes back a long way. At least they spoke out in a forthright manner, even if they were badly wrong ultimately. It's different today when many scientists, who may have other agendas besiege with charts and graphs, and the ""you better believe me or else"" mentality with ""Man made global warming scenarios"" while they also, are looking over their shoulders in case a fellow scientist comes up with something better, scientists like fashion statements too...but only as long as there is a big following, they are just a little more conservative than the Plebians. Anyway the quote;



""By Walter E. Williams – Now that another Earth Day has come and gone,

let’s look at some environmentalists’ predictions they would prefer we forget.



At the first Earth Day celebration, in 1969, environmentalist Nigel

Calder warned, ""The threat of a new ice age must now stand alongside

nuclear war as a likely source of wholesale death and misery for

mankind."" C.C. Wallen of the World Meteorological Organization said,

""The cooling since 1940 has been large enough and consistent enough

that it will not soon be reversed.""



In 1968, Professor Paul Ehrlich, former Vice President Al Gore’s hero

and mentor, predicted a major food shortage in the U.S. and ""in the

1970s… hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death.""

Mr. Ehrlich forecast 65 million Americans would die of starvation

between 1980 and 1989, and by 1999 the U.S. population would have

declined to 22.6 million. Mr. Ehrlich’s predictions about England were

gloomier: ""If I were a gambler, I would take even money that England

will not exist in the year 2000.""



In 1972, a report for the Club of Rome warned the world would run out

of gold by 1981, mercury and silver by 1985, tin by 1987 and

petroleum, copper, lead and natural gas by 1992.



Gordon Taylor, in his 1970 book ""The Doomsday Book,"" said Americans

were using 50 percent of the world’s resources and ""by 2000 they [Americans] will,

if permitted, be using all of them.""



In 1975, the Environmental Fund took out full-page ads warning, ""The

World as we know it will likely be ruined by the year 2000.""



Harvard University biologist George Wald in 1970 warned, ""civilization

will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken

against problems facing mankind."" That was the same year Sen. Gaylord

Nelson warned, in Look Magazine, that by 1995 ""somewhere between 75

and 85 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.""



It’s not just latter-day doomsayers who have been wrong; doomsayers

have always been wrong. In 1885, the U.S. Geological Survey announced

there was ""little or no chance"" of oil being discovered in California,



and a few years later they said the same about Kansas and Texas. In

1939, the U.S. Interior Department said American oil supplies would

last only another 13 years. In 1949, the interior secretary said the

end of U.S. oil supplies was in sight.



Having learned nothing from its earlier erroneous claims, in 1974 the

U.S. Geological Survey advised us that the U.S. had only a 10-year

supply of natural gas. In fact,, according to the American Gas

Association, there’s a 1,000- to 2,500-year supply.



Here are my questions: In 1970, when environmentalists were making

predictions of manmade global cooling and the threat of an ice age and

millions of Americans starving to death, what kind of government

policy should we have undertaken to prevent such a calamity?



When Mr. Ehrlich predicted England would not exist in the

year 2000,

what steps should the British Parliament have taken in 1970 to prevent

such a dire outcome? In 1939, when the Interior Department warned we

only had oil supplies for another 13 years, what actions should

President Roosevelt have taken? Finally, what makes us think

environmental alarmism is any more correct now the tune has been

switched to manmade global warming?



Here are a few facts: More than 95 percent of the greenhouse effect is

the result of water vapor in Earth’s atmosphere. Without the

greenhouse effect, Earth’s average temperature would be zero degrees

Fahrenheit. Most climate change is due to the orbital eccentricities

of Earth and variations in the sun’s output. On top of that, natural

wetlands produce more greenhouse gas contributions annually than all

human sources combined.

professor of economics at George Mason University.""

Stellar, no one is arguing that the citizens won't be right there with the military.



The US has never won a war with the Army that was standing at the time the War broke out.

It was always fought by citizen soldiers.



But do not estimate the purpose and real-time dedication to the US by our Armed Forces.



A lot of folks talk about the absolute ""waste"" in our fighting in Vietnam, but fail to consider the world situation at the time.

At all times, your military actions are being observed by others. Conclusions are being reached, evaluated, and then modified as conditions change.



The Soviet Union was the power that faced the US during Viet Nam, but they were facing NATO and American troops in Europe.



The Soviets watched the actions of the US in Vietnam and soberly concluded that if the American would fight so hard at such a cost for a country they really didn't give a * about, how much harder would they fight the Soviets if they elected to expand across Europe, where we in fact DID give a *.



So never assume that soldiers don't know what they're fighting for, what they're ultimate sacrifice is for, or their motivations.



While I always fought for the man beside me, I likewise always fought underneath my flag. I knew my bread from my butter, and which side it was buttered on.



Oh, we bitched about the heat, the lack of shelter at times, the bugs, the shortages, the taste of the water, but never would I exchange that for a comfortable sitting at home.And when Bob Hope would trot out a hottie, and say ""Just wanted to remind you boys what you're fighting for,"" never were truer words spoken.



Hi dooper, hope you didn't feel too left out.Perhaps you are not but 'service' members do seem to find cowards everywhere in civilian life? Why is it that you guys have such a hard time believing that people could have legitimate reasons for opposing 'war' ( to say nothing of the US track record of invading utterly innocent and un-threatening third world countries) other than being 'cowardly' and too afraid to do something? How do so many of you turn their arguments of not wishing to be part of illegal unconstitutional wars into attacks on their personal bravery? Shouldn't we wait until their liberties are actually threatened by heavily armed foreign invaders that managed to get past the rather mighty USN?As both of us were clearly aware, yes. The regular volunteer army is used to instigate wars that they sometimes can't end which leads to mass conscription and the like. isn't that a perfectly good reason why a standing army/ USAF should be limited to the continental US with much effort being put into sealift capacity? What will those thousand and more bases do, when attacked, beside providing the US government a pretext for escalation now that US citizens have become involved? Much like asking why the Romans didn't go home after a conquest this question is perhaps both asked and answered.The purpose of the US armed forces is to follow orders and while the soldiers may believe they are protecting their nation, or whatever they like really, the contracts they have signed tells a very different story as to who and what they are really serving. As i have stated this is not a outright attack on what may motivate American citizens from joining the military or giving a good account of themselves in battle but about who they are sent to fight.A lot of folks have not failed to consider the larger world picture and understand that the Vietnam war was fought as perpetuation of the French imperial doctrine which the US hoped to take over in the region. Obviously since US citizens and soldiers are for the most part against the idea of imperialism you can't tell them that so you make up this 'evil enemy' ( the USSR, or even more ridiculously in the Vietnam case the CCP) that 'somehow' have spread it's tentacle's all over the world. What is never discussed is how you 'know' ( like Joseph McCarthy raving about "" This document shows/proves "" , never really disclosing his 'sources' ) what they are doing without having similar tentacle's and intelligence operations everywhere. What the USSR, Cuba and the CCP and others DID do was threaten the control the imperialist ( who changed their name to capitalist around that time) by merely surviving in their own countries thus allowing the people of the world to think that there were in fact alternatives to imperial/corporate capitalism. It wasn't that they were going to take over the world , they were not trying as 'the documents' showed then ( and certainly now in retrospect when the archives where opened), but that the one's who already had control where rightfully paranoid about having to share the world with rival ideologies when their own people were already fighting corporate capitalism at home.The USSR did not face the US during Vietnam by choice and were mostly compelled to do so by the please of the Vietnamese; it's hard to pretend to say that you will resist imperialism/capitalism and then refuse to aid those who are under attack by the very imperial powers you claim you are resisting. The fundamental fact that you are ignorant of or misrepresenting ( i think you just don't know) is that the Ho Chi Minh were a simple nationalist who would court communism in the short term interest of surviving the imperial french and then the US and allies. This was all documented before that war ever got start but declassified material and statements by the US role players speaks volumes about how little they understood about the world or what sort of lies they will now tell to hide the fact that they willfully destroyed a nation that were not , did not and never wanted to go communist. .The fact that the Vietnamese fought off a Chinese invasion ( they say it was a 'raid') may or may not in your mind help to prove that they were nationalist, not communist.This is all detailed in ""Killing hope"" which sources directly from the Pentagon papers which goes into some detail as to how many times Ho Chi Minh tried to gain the help of the US in the Vietnamese struggle of independence against the various imperial powers. Basically he trusted the US more than he trusted Stalin's idea of 'communism' ( it wasn't) and wrote eight letters to the US state department and Truman himself. The following might sound familiar :""All men are created equal. They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.""Would you believe me if i told you that that is how the declaration of independence Minh framed in 1945 opens? All just a communist conspiracy, right?As i said it's all in the Pentagon papers but hey, that's a 'liberal conspiracy', right?Yes, establishing authority by proving that you will kill millions of innocents and throw away the lives of 200 000 of your own in the process. I think they got the message that they were in a struggle for their very survival long before Vietnam courtesy of the numerous western ( Yes, Hitler did pretty much as he was expected to beside for going west first) western invasions of Russia in the the century before.Look even you clearly don't know what you fought for , or more important what you didn't fight for, and your way past your fighting prime. I will assume that soldiers know what they are fighting for when they stop fighting illegal, immoral wars against 'enemies' that never threatened to or in fact attacked the United States of America.Yes, drafted soldiers fight because it suits them, but more often than not they actually believe the propaganda, to believe that they are doing their country a service; something they discover to be quite the lie as things go along and people die in the supposed defense of 'liberty'.Why are you so ready to give up the comforts previous generations died to arrange for both themselves and you? Why do you so easily march off to war against people that could never harm your country? Why the irrational fear of the 'communist' and the even more irrational attacks on those who were by no means communist before they were forced to side with whoever were in fact willing to supply the weapons thy desperately needed to fight the ACTUAL invaders&occupiers?All i see is the accusation that someone must be a coward for not wanting to fight and yet i know for a fact that men would rather risk their lives and kill innocents than risk being called cowards for not wanting to fight wars they know to be wrong; the people who pick up guns and march off the war are more often than not the real cowards who would rather kill or be killed than face the possibility of jail them or public derision for doing what they knew to be right.So from now on if you feel compelled to call those who refuse to march to war without a legal reason or moral obligation 'cowards' i will could either call you a coward for not having the guts to refuse to participate or ignorant/misguided for having yourself literally used and abused by the same old imperial system the founding fathers and others fought for.So much for the 'brave' who are on average no braver than they are misguided and ignorant; at least the nazi's had to hang Germans to inspire them to go to war but what would your defense have been if another nation had the power to prosecute you?I don't for a moment buy into the 'peace' at any cost notion but Vietnam did as much to expose America's weakness to potential enemies ( who are acting largely in self defense given the clearly irrational imperial aims of the US national security state) as Iraq is doing today and if this course is kept up i am afraid all those nightmares about 'enemies' might come to pass.Stellar",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Christianity is not anti-sceince. I have also been in a thread in the science section about Radiometric dating.

2) Unless an air carrier has FAA-approved procedures under § 121.587(b), the flight deck door must remain closed during flight time. In order to operate the flight deck door during flight time and permit flight deck access by persons authorized in accordance with § 121.547, part 121 certificate holders must develop and use FAA-approved procedures regarding the opening, closing, and locking of the flight deck door. These FAA‑approved procedures should be included in the operators’ operations and F/A manuals. Additionally, § 121.313 requires any associated signal or identity confirmation system to be easily detectible and operable by each flightcrew member from his or her duty station. To meet security needs of accomplishing an audio and visual identification, one person on the flight deck is required to visually identify the person seeking access through the viewing port or viewing device.







f) Procedures for two person flightcrews, when one flightcrew member leaves the flight deck (i.e., a F/A must lock the door and remain on the flight deck until the flightcrew member returns to his or her station).







B. Rules for Which Exemptions are Inappropriate.

Normally, the FAA does not issue exemptions from rules in which deviation authority is specifically provided. For example, 14 CFR part 91, § 91.903 provides that a Certificate of Waiver authorizing the operation of an aircraft in deviation of part 91 subpart B may be issued if the Administrator finds that the proposed operation can be safely conducted under the terms of the waiver.

The less people know about important complex issues such as the economy, energy consumption and the environment, the more they want to avoid becoming well-informed, according to new research published by the American Psychological Association.



And the more urgent the issue, the more people want to remain unaware, according to a paper published online in APA's Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.



[Edit for brevity -- DJW001]



Through a series of five studies conducted in 2010 and 2011 with 511 adults in the United States and Canada, the researchers described ""a chain reaction from ignorance about a subject to dependence on and trust in the government to deal with the issue.""

In one study, participants who felt most affected by the economic recession avoided information challenging the government's ability to manage the economy. However, they did not avoid positive information, the study said. This study comprised 197 Americans with a mean age of 35 (111 women and 89 men), who had received complex information about the economy and had answered a question about how the economy is affecting them directly....

I'm sure that this research confirms many of the opinions held by most members of ATS. The more complex the world becomes, the more helpless one feels. The more helpless one feels, the more inclined one is to depend on others. It is easiest to leave the hard work to a professional class, or government, and just ignore what is going on all around. This is why denying ignorance is important; the people one trusts are not necessarily any more capable of understanding the situation.Unfortunately, the cycle does not work the other way around.

Revelation 6:12 I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red,



Joel 2:31 The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD.



Ezekiel 32:7 When I snuff you out, I will cover the heavens and darken their stars; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not give its light.



The Seven Seals is a phrase in the Book of Revelation that refers to seven symbolic seals that secure the book or scroll, that John of Patmos saw in his Revelation of Jesus Christ. The opening of the seals, on the Apocalyptic document occurs in Revelation Chapters 5-8. In John's vision, the only one worthy to open the book is referred to as both the ""Lion of Judah"" and the ""Lamb having seven horns and seven eyes"".[5:5-6] Upon the Lamb opening a seal from the book, a judgment is released or an apocalyptic event occurs. The opening of the first four seals release The Four Horsemen, each with their own specific mission.[6:1-8] The opening of the fifth seal releases the cries of martyrs for the ""word of God"".[6:9-11] The sixth seal prompts cataclysmic events.[6:12-17] The seventh seal cues seven angelic trumpeters who in turn cue the seven bowl judgments.

Before i start i just want to say that all information in this thread is verifiable by either Nasa:s own footage on their sites or from scientists and arkeologists by searching on the internet.Many of you have probably seen this clip where a giant triangle have been seen in the Sun, partly obscured by sunstorms in the corona. This Triangle is HUGE, and do not look natural. It seems to have been there for a long time looking back at pictures, but was always far more obscured than now, so this Triangle shape have never been this visible before!But this is not what this thread is about, as there is already another thread about that.I instead want to show you what have recently been found out about this in other areas of research.If you watch this clip Nassim Haramein have found some new artifacts that talk about this Triangle in the Sun... keep in mind this was before this Triangle was actually spotted!(At 4:30 is the artifact depicting the Triangle in the Sun being used as a Stargate!)So now we know the ancients called the Sun a ""Doorway"" or ""Stargate"", that they depicted it as having a Triangle in it´s center, and that Alien craft (Ufo:s) or Flying saucers will attack earth after coming out of the sun from the Triangle... But when will this happen?Well apparently, it started the 8th of March, as is evidenced by this clip (and can be verified on Nasas own site)See that ? They are literally pouring out of the Stargate in the Sun! They are completely filling the surrounding space, thousands of them in the matter of one day! I bet if they all moved towards earth they would black out the Sun completely for 3 days before actually arriving!Now i am no bible-fanatic, i am actually an Atheist, but i know that parts of the Bible was just ""copied"" from the old egyptian texts and the hebrew bible (which talks alot about our creators as coming in spaceships and being from outer space...) as these parts are.What is the sixth seal?So the sixth seal comes after the four horsemen, have they already been here? Considering the state of affairs in the world, i would say yes, maybe they where, it sure looks like it. Metaphorically, in this case, as alot of the bible is supposed to be read metaphorically.And the sixth seal is apparently a sign of cataclysmic events... like a Stargate in the Sun? And after that is apparently judgment... Is that what the mayans was referring to at the end of this calendar?These spacecraft are apparently around the sun now, or at least was on the 8:th of march. I wonder how long it will take them to come here? What kind of engines they have? We know they use Stargates to transport vast distances, which may be because the lightspeed-barrier might not be overcome and Einstein was right. therefore other forms of travel than using Stargates between systems is impossible, due to the vast energies/time required. Energy that is abundant in a Star!This also means they would have to use physical travel to get between stars and planets or interstellar space, which is restricted by the lightspeed barrier, which means they probably have engines similar to ours or at most a few hundred or thousand % more efficient. Our best engines currently would reach the Sun in 12-18 months, and that is alot faster than the engines used when going to the moon... ( wiki.answers.com... ) so if their engines are somewhere betweeen 12-18 times faster than ours(which seems entirely reasonable), this means they could be here in a month.Then what?",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I admit I do not believe the OS for 911, how ever I'm not sure this is quite on the level of a false flag attack.A pressure cooker is actually an easy to acquire, ready to use explosive vessel. It's intended to hold pressure in, how ever if it's max load is exceeded it can fail catastrophically. Putting black powder in this vessel is enough to exceed it's maximum pressure load, how ever at the same time a far superior casing than paper, cardboard, or a pipe put together in a shop.The longer the container resists the expansion of the powder the more powerful the resulting blast will be.If you put a pile of gunpowder on the ground and light it, it goes woof. If you used a paper or cardboard tube it goes bang, but does not produce as large of a concussive shock wave as say a steel pipe capped on both ends.A steel pipe capped on both ends will fail sooner than a pressure cooker, and you have to assemble it just right so one of the caps doesn't just blow off. I know this is sort of a weird spin on things, but it's a very effective means of building an explosive device and you can find old steel pressure cookers in thrift shops for a few bucks. You can buy black powder or smokeless powder at many fire arms dealers/sporting goods stores, and if you wanted to increase your bang you could use ANFO which is really not that hard to make, or acquire the quantities to fill a few pressure cookers.Another interesting property to this format is the lid would most likely fail first, making it more a rudimentary directional claymore mine. Enough delay is provided to allow efficient detonation of the explosive, and releasing devastating results.Disgusting in all regards, but definitely not complicated in any regard. I'm still waiting to hear about how the devices were set off.I'm still not convinced this is a false flag attack. I do not see where additional rights will be infringed.

He said it was a great little helicopter, about 90 pecent of the Apache for about 70 percent of the price, but no one would buy it on the international market because it didn't have the logistical tail that McDonnell Douglas or Bell did.



And he was right. The Agusta, Denel, and Kamov are all good solid acceptable airplanes (the Russians would probably GIVE the Kamov away) but no one bought them because of supportability considerations.



As far as I know, only the Italians fly the A129 helicopter, since both Germany and France were required politically to buy the Tiger, Australia got a Tiger factory, the Turks ordered the Whiskey Cobra (they're re-thinking that, BTW) and almost everyone else bought the A- or D-model Apaches.



Interestingly enough, Westland Helicopters, the first company to build the Apache Longbow under license, has since merged with Agusta. Had this been done ten years earlier, the Brits might've been flying the A129 instead of the WAH-64.

They may want merely to know what opposition from nature their rockets are apt to encounter when they climb deep into space. Or they may have a more ambitious interest: a nearby, natural satellite might be a more convenient base in space than the... Read more



Professor Tombaugh is closemouthed about his results. He won't say whether or not any small natural satellites have been discovered. He does say, however, that newspaper reports of 18 months ago announcing the discovery of natural satellites at 400 and 600 miles out are not correct. He adds that there is no connection between the search program and the reports of so-called flying saucers.[16] At a 1957 meteor conference in Los Angeles, Tombaugh reiterated that his four-year search for natural satellites had been unsuccessful.[17] In 1959 Tombaugh issued a final report stating that nothing had been found in his search.

I know a lot of people want to focus on the pictures. And that is completely understandable. They look interesting and mysterious.The problem is that by concentrating on the pictures that are from more recent times, we are forgetting something a LOT more important, and that is the reason why the subject even exists.An ancient (or just old) satellite, in orbit around the Earth.....prior to the US or USSR placing anything in orbit.I would think that one would concentrate on that claim first that came out in 1954 and not a STS photo.Basically we have a single source for this claim. Only one person that made this claim:Mr. Keyhoe made claims that there was a artificial satellite, possibly two, in orbit around the Earth, that the Army has spotted it using radar in mid 1953, and had commissioned Clyde Tombaugh (the person that found Pluto), to search the skies for these satellites.Mr. Keyhoe's source? A unknown person at the Pentagon, according to him.Now, let's take a look at something here. Let's go back a little bit before 14 May, 1954. Let us go back to:Or 15 March, 1954, TIME magazine: Time Magazine (sorry guys, have to subscribe to read the rest of the article).Or 20 March, 1954:So what we have here is, several articles talking about what the Army and Tombaugh are doing.....months before Mr. Keyhoe publishes anything. Not the other way around (Keyhoe states something, and the Army defends it's actions with a story).This also isn't a ""Swamp Gas"", ""Weather Balloon"", or ""Planet Venus"" explanation to some UFO sighting or anything like that.This was actual research being done to see if there was anything up there that was small and orbiting the Earth.The only one making a claim that it was otherwise was Mr. Keyhoe.In fact, Clyde Tombaugh said this:So again, while I understand the the STS pictures are interesting, and later stories are also interesting, I think the very foundation of the entire story is important to look at. It basically boils down to this:March 1954 it's announced that the US Army commissions Clyde Tombaugh to look for small satellites that might be in orbit around Earth.May 1954, Donald Keyhoe claims that the US Army is really looking for an artificial satellite, and even claims that they found one (or maybe two), and cites his source as someone in the Pentagon.The whole story of BKS is based upon one person having a statement published in May of 1954. It's like a single very weak stick holding up a house. Kick the stick away and the house comes down.While I find the story very interesting myself, I'm surprised that so many would rather ignore the original sources for the whole thing, and concentrate on the pictures taken in more modern times, well after the fact that not only the US and USSR were able to put junk up there, but other countries too.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think that the world is better off if people share knowledge, including spelling/grammar/etc.



Just because it ""annoys"" you or because you ""didn't like English class"" doesn't give you some special position where you can bully and insult others into not helping others learn more.



There's nothing wrong with giving others a few tips.

Well think of it this way.

.....The point that I am trying to drive home is the fact that Ebola has been delivered to us in order to frighten and I dare say expose us to a major killer.





If the medical authorities had been prudent the medical care that is needed for Americans would have been delivered, not the other way around. I don't trust western medicine or the profit driven research that fuels it. None of us should after this.



Personally I am not frightened about this, but I don't work or live in the Atlanta area.

Ebola was delivered to West Africa to killand steal their resources. Frightening us is just a collateral benefit - and that fear has been manipulated to justify taking away even more of our rights, liberties and personal freedoms.Whether we rescue our own or ""leave them behind enemy lines"" - Ebola WILL come here. Just like chikungunya, West Nile and other diseases, and just like we exported our measles and flu and everything else. We can either use the opportunity to learn more and try to get ahead of it, or not.This is not just about delivering medical care. It's about ""no man left behind."" And much-needed research. We know little about Ebola because it's always been in emergency care in tents with no facilities and really tired doctors who are just trying to stay on their feet (not trying to learn about the virus). ...But my view on the research is more a Pollyanna rationalization.

Wow...thanks for a very nice and stimulating read this morning. No judgements of Christ, the Church, no juvenile comments, a well thought out and intriguing thread. Thank you.



Perhaps John the Baptist is an icon to the Templars because he was as they were and are... Holders of unforeseen knowledge, outcasts, radical in their thinking, protectors, and on the cutting edge so to speak.



Just as John the Baptist lived in perilous times, so did the Templars...as demonstrated by their demise...as well as any thoughts and ideas that deviated from the church...aka...Da Vinci, Michaelangelo.



So, they all hid...John in the wilderness, Templars underground and into the masonic lodges( unions), and Da Vinci and Michaelangelo as artists in the church.



The Catholic Church of that time was very powerful and harsh. Any idea or thought that deviated from the official dogma was condemned and punished or eradicated.







The Templars, anything Jewish, anything enlightened to real knowledge had to hide from the church and the inquisition in Europe... so many did in the trade unions...aka Masons...these stone workers had mathematical knowledge, engineering skills, artists artisans, craftsmen... FREE THINKERS. Such is why they are always at the base of any radical ideas and efforts.



Thanks for the info...best thread in a while.

Thank you for your kind words! I am just trying to get the facts straight and see what people think about all of these coincidences and similarities. All i want is the truth and i don't want to make people upset on my way to finding it, people can believe whatever they want to believe!Well some people think that the Knights Templar and the Priory of Sion were created by the same group. They think that the Prior was born out of the Templars and i think there could be something to this. If you look into the Rennes le Chateau mystery and Southern France, there is a lot of early jewish beliefs floating around there from Mary Magdalene. I think this is an important piece of the puzzle.Yes the church was very cruel to scientist, thinkers and artist during that time. Da Vinci definitely helped start the renaissance and it appears that the Masons were the perfect vehicle to discuss ""free ideas"".The Templars and the Masons have so many jewish connections there has to be something to it. All of the original Templars came from Southern France and they were probably some how related to the Merovingian Dynasty, possibly through Mary Magdalane. Also the first king of Jerusalem was Baldwin who was from Southern France. Also Godfrey de Bouillon, the first ruler of Jerusalem before Baldwin took over as King was from Southern France. It appears that Southern France had a huge part in the first Crusade. Of all the european nations fighting for Jerusalem why did the people from Southern France rule the new land?",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But what I'm saying it's not maybe the most friendliest way to interact with others and you can expect reactions such as his is by doing so.You do point out yourself that ""Poor research results in poor results!"" I do agree, now show us some of yours please. Don't just ridicule post made by others without offering any proof / even link what seems to be missing in your latest post from other of your claims about Hoagland's towers to back you up yourself.Don't take this as personal attack please, that's far what it is. I just wanted to point this out for you and I hope we can continue to look into these subjects together.Cheers",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What is the Pipeline exactly?



The Keystone Pipeline already exists. What doesn’t is its proposed expansion, the Keystone XL Pipeline. The existing one runs from oil sand fields in Alberta, Canada into the U.S., ending in Cushing, Oklahoma.



The 1,700 new miles of pipeline would offer two sections of expansion. First, it would connect Cushing, Oklahoma, where there is a current bottleneck of oil, with the Gulf Coast of Texas, where oil refineries abound. Second, it would include a new section from Alberta to Kansas. It would pass through Bakken Shale region of eastern Montana and western North Dakota. Here, it will pass through a region where oil extraction is currently booming and take on some of this crude for transport.



The requirement for reporting oil spills stems from the Discharge of Oil Regulation, known as the ""sheen rule."" Under this regulation, oil spill reporting does not depend on the specific amount of oil spilled, but on the presence of a visible sheen created by the spilled oil. Reporting an oil discharges may also be required under the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) Rule. For more information on reporting oil discharges, please see:

I'm going to sleep on the part of this I'm really disturbed by on several levels. It's about that time anyway and I'm barely focusing after reading all night. Anyway, it wouldn't be fair not to at least share what I picked up and had first intended to be chasing as the main story. It'll be an entirely new thread if I do something with the other part of it. It won't be on this one. Just OT enough and far too much work for a simple reply.Here is what I'd already accumulated though, and again, I'm beat so I'm offering this in the quick version.That was my first surprise. Keystone itself has been built from the tar sands right into Oklahoma and just pumping right on away for quite awhile now. This is an additional spur/extension line of the existing one. It's amaaaazing how many reports I read that failed to mention that minor detail.Or how many maps sure didn't look like THIS one.Or this one....Funny, I see so little mention of the full blown network of pipes that already run over the border and have for a long time now in some cases. There was mention of thousands of reported spills from one cross border line, so I went to look that up and found how patently absurd and silly that number likely was as quoted around the net.The EPA these days isn't one to screw with, either. I'd imagine they DO report anything noticeable by regulation. The fines and hits the EPA gives out almost like it's fun are just too much to really play at. I saw that myself with the new lead regulations for simple window replacement and basic remodel jobs in construction. It's ...staggering.- This is another site with good, solid maps of the current pipelines as well as the currently operational Keystone pipeline with the planned one aside it.- Here is the state department report coverage which showed minimal environmental impact (Someone asked about that and I came across it)- Finally, the best for last without getting into what I may do another thread for is...A couple people had asked about more for what it was all about and I think the above covers most of the important aspects from a factual standpoint. Draw your own conclusions and I stick with my previous note on being against the extension on export probability of most or all of it. Find another transshipment point, is my overall feeling. Now very strongly held, too.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The previous paragraph is a perfect example of how you ""revoke"" free thinking, and ""Suppress"" free speech. In this case by negating the intrinsic value of an opposing point of view, with the claim that it is not valid because it only opposes an opinion or someones belief.

So therefore the claim of global cooling or an incoming Ice age because of this hailstorm is stupid, and should have been research by you (OP), before posting the OP, instead of trusting a random Youtube.

a reply to: Mianeye Thank you kindly sir. That is much better. Now we have something to talk about. However ....Hail of this magnitude is unusual anywhere let alone right next to the equator. Other events around the planet are also 'normal' except for their frequency and strength. A little research is in order.One thing you cannot possibly disagree with ... is that we are experiencing a time of minimum solar output. History tells us that this causes events such as the Marauder Minimum. That was an event where crops failed and multitudes died from starvation.The OP is NOT saying that these extremely rare hailstorms prove this, the OP is saying that these events are an indicator that out weather is going nuts. The weather is if you will, out of balance.The jet stream is not where it should be, ice is melting and all sorts of other bad things are happening.If you remember nothing more, then remember this. The Sun provides the power for Earth's weather. Without the steady Sun's output, weather will change. We are seeing that happen right now.Nowhere did the OP talk about an ice age .... but you did.Now then. This graph should scare the pants off anyone with a brain.We are headed for an ice age ... we are due for one.It will not be tomorrow and in all probability it will not happen in your grandkids' lifetime but it is coming.

Do you really think these revolutions are about democracy? As it turns out Resentedhalo was right, the Muslim Brotherhood are taking control of Egypt. This is a radical Islamic group, who wants 'death to the Jews and the West'! Why is Obama so fixated on outing Muammer Gaddafi when protesters all around the Middle East are still being killed by oppresive leaders? Don't you notice how the U.S. government is only concerned about democracy when it furthers their agenda?What they're trying to do is spark rage into the people of the Middle East and direct that anger at the U.S., Europe, and Israel.

Now to what's happening here in America





Meanwhile, all the executives of the corporations who were 'brought down' sit in their nice cozy multimillion dollar house, with several cars, a trophy wife, and a massive bank account not in U.S. Dollars.







When the citizens beg for change they can finally bring in what what Obama, Bush, Clinton, Tony Blair, George Soros, Kissinger, and dozens of other world leaders, politicions, billionaires, millionaires, and influential people have called for openly; a ""New World Order"" Meanwhile, all the executives of the corporations who were 'brought down' sit in their nice cozy multimillion dollar house, with several cars, a trophy wife, and a massive bank account not in U.S. Dollars. They're trying to get enough people to bite the bait, and protest to bring down corporations that the stability of our economy is unfortunately dependant on to collape Wall Street. Doesn't it make sense? When you can blame the people for the collapse of the economy, you can open up many more doors for your globalistic/dictatorship ideas, and the people will be much more submissive. Why? Because it's their fault a loaf of bread costs $$50, and there's mass chaos, violence, and looting on the streets.

(No she's not on your side either but she's right)After the media talks long enough about revolutions, people begin to think it's just a normal occurence and stop paying attention. So what do they do next? Spark protests and rallies here. The thing is, these aren't just ordinary protests.

I get the response, ""Well you may want to take one of our booklets, there's info in there on how to be a good dad"".



I replied, ""I'm already a good dad, i don't need to read that to be told that thank you!.....don't knock on my door please."" They replied, ""The Lord can help you be a better dad"".



Really got my goat up. Sorry, i know it's not a major thing, but i go out of my way to be a good dad, always have done, always will do. I don't need people telling me that imaginary people in the sky can help me be a better person to my kids.

Early teens...I think that says it all. They are in the learning process, trying to do what they think is right, trying to learn what to say to not make people upset (virtually impossible by the way, different people will get upset at different things) I'll tell you one thing though, these kids aren't in jail, they aren't doing drugs, they aren't out hurting anyone. They are keeping busy trying to talk to people that they know will laugh at them, mock them, hate them, and then joke about how cool it was when they made a couple of kids feel bad about preaching. Not you, you were upset, but I see others do that all the time. Man do you know how hard it is to go talk to people that you don't know? But it keeps these kids busy and it keeps them out of trouble. I grew up as one, I haven't been for a few years, but I still have only good things to say about them. I'm sure they weren't trying to make you feel bad, from their perspective they said something positive, I'm sure they had no clue that anybody would get upset by it.

403145,"If there is no beginning or end, then why is it such a difficult concept to grasp? If time is an illusion instilled so that we can learn...why do we think linearly? It seems as though thought patterns go forward and to learn is to go forward but when there is no forward or backward, shouldn't we be able to think backwards, learn backwards i.e. forgetting information forcibly, the same way you learn information, through experience. If there is no time, then why don't we just learn everything in an instant, why is there a linear pattern? Unless we already know everything, which everything tells me, we do, then why is it forgotten, what is the point? If we're part of a conciousness that has no beggining or end, is eternal, why does it need to grow? Does it break off into small clusters of imformationless energy, which in turn grows on its own, learns on its own and off of others, until the universe..that place of nothing-yet everything, is full of super gods? Whats the purpose? To entertain someone else's game?



Now I can see how you would say...want to learn something, grow, develope yourself, help others, and it makes you feel good. But it seems to me these ambitions from built in energy/vibrational instincts or feelings are just pieces of code which control our existance. What the hell is the purpose? I like to make people happy and be filled with a sense of accomplishment, but so does any robot, that only thinks this way because we programmed it to.



Its like we one day understand that we are this eternal...pointless 'being', a brick in the foundation of the house where no'one lives, and that one day (day= thinking linear again.) we will realise we are just a brick, and that what we think is irrelevant, and that everything is irrelevant and that it wouldn't really matter if we purged ourselves from existance. Because what do we know about existence? To be one with god is to lose the need for sense of self and to know all and see all? To be a fish swimming upstream in a school? To reach what?



Seems to me like what I think and why my computer is told to think is one in the same. This is just a loop stuck in my head, but for some reason it does not dictate my life. Although it should. This is what happens when I get sent home from work early, disillusioned.



What is time, why create a being that finds it so difficult to grasp, why can't i concentrate? Why do I feel like when I try to meditate, i'm doing nothing. Should I think my thoughts are divine? Is it divine that I think my carpet smells, that i am tired, that I'm just making things up from familiar objects and expected to feel they have significance? Is my spirit guide a bear? I don't even like bears really. And it never tells me anything, I feel like I got to make up words to tell it, to tell to me. Is it all even real? A freind of mine said she was speaking to some higher being that was disgusted with humans because we don't kill the bad people in our society. But I personally don't think any body is bad, and that to kill them would hinder their learning process, it seems to counter-act everything I've been told. Doesn't seem like ultimate wisdom from a divine being.



It feels like its the year 2069 and I'm the first man-made robot that has become self-aware. They ask the robot, ""Robot-steve, whats the weather going to be like today, can you mop the floor, can you do this math for me?"" And my answer is something like, why? why do you care? why should you care? And then I shut myself off.

The only reason I can think of is that the statement (whether accident was real or not) is to serve as a warning to other journalists with the guts to take on the big guys.. my head hurts to try and think of another reason to keep it from the public ( unless gigantic errors during investigation are contained in said report... but if that were the case surely FOIA inquiries could be made by family at least, and a proper ""independent"" investigation should take place? )

First - thanks for continuing to care.Second - I don't think Michael Krikorian has any alterior motives at play. I think he's just like the rest of us. He has a job (which is not as an investigator - but as a writer/journalist) that he does quite well, in my opinion. But when it comes to ""this expert says"" vs ""that expert says otherwise""...he chooses to go with the experts he's familiar with - which, in this case, is the LAPD (minimally).In truth - I understand the sentiment for the reason given in that last paragraph...and would agree with it, if I believed Michael Hastings was barreling with a wreath of Hell's Bell's around his neck through those intersections...Again - I agree.As it stands - and for as long as the case is not ""closed"" - they can refuse to divulge what they did and found.Maybe they're just like us...hoping for some new tidbit of information....that proves they were ""right"" after all.They certainly can't prove it with what has been made public so far.What really frustrates me is that neither Doug Hagmann (the Private Investigator) or his unnamed cohorts in L.A. have given any further updates since broadcasting that his 40 hours of research had convinced him - this wasIf they found info that proved that conclusion to be a little premature - it would still do them good ""to ADMIT it"", rather than simply hoping it would fade unnoticed into history.I'm still working on this...

380755,"Been visiting the site again and noticed this forum. Food is a great common interest for almost everyone. As a Wannabe Chef from way back I would like to share a recipe or two and try yours as well. I figure there’s a lot of Spaghetti Sauce Recipes out there. Let’s see what you got. I will start with mine.

MY BEST SPAGHETTI MEAT SAUCE

This is a recipe I have developed and used for over 2 decades. It is one of my kid’s favorites, and has fed my household and guests many, many times. It is fairly easy to make and results in a lot of thick, meaty, and flavor rich sauce.



This recipe will feed 12-15 people depending on appetites. It freezes very well. When my house was full I used to make it about once a month and vacuum seal the leftovers for quick meals. I would usually makeup a few 3-4 potion bags of sauce and left over noodles, and seal the remaining sauce by itself.



For those looking for a smaller recipe you should be able to half this or cut it down proportionately, but, I have to admit I’ve never tried.



INGREDIENTS:

5 lbs Ground Beef or Chuck

1 lb Italian Sausage

3-4 28 Ounce Cans Diced Tomatoes

6-8 6 Ounce Cans Tomato Paste (I like Contadina Brand with Italian Herbs or Basil/Garlic)

10-12 Ounces Minced Garlic (the kind that’s packed in liquid in a screw top glass or plastic container)

4-6 Medium Onions (Chopped)

1 2 Ounce Container “Mrs. Dash” Tomato Basil Garlic Seasoning Blend

2TBS Oregano

2 TBS-1/4 Cup Sugar

1 Bottle Red Wine (Merlot, Cabernet, or Chianti)



Spaghetti Noodles: At least 3 ounces dry noodles per person to be served.

According to the manufacturers 1-16 oz. Box or Package of Spaghetti Noodles yields 8 servings, never worked that way in my house. I usually just cook a whole box and mix and seal what’s left with sauce.



EQUIPMENT:

16 Quart Soup Pot (for Sauce)

12 or 16 Quart Stock Pot (for Noodles)

12 Inch Skillet or Sauté Pan

Sturdy Long Handled Spoon for Stirring

Ladle for Serving

Note: In my mind a Stock Pot is for cooking liquid Soups and Stews, and Soup Pot is a Stock Pot with a more substantial bottom that is more suitable to brown or braise meat, in addition to cooking liquid Soups and Stews.



PREPARATION:

Ground Beef: Brown the Ground Beef in the Soup Pot.

Italian Sausage: Slice the Italian Sausage in 1/2 inch chunks and brown in Skillet. Once the sausage is browned I usually chop it into smaller pieces. Put the Beef and Sausage in a large colander or strainer over the sink to drain. I also like to put a little of the chopped sausage and beef back in the skillet and continue browning until crisp, it adds a little texture to the sauce.

After cooking the meat, leave the skillet as is don’t clean it yet.



Onions: Chop or dice the onions and sauté with a little olive oil (I like to sauté them in the skillet I used for the Italian Sausage it will add a little flavor.



Garlic: Once the onions start to caramelize add the Minced Garlic to the pan and continue to sauté for a few minutes then remove from heat.



Sauce: Empty the Diced Tomatoes with the juice into the Soup Pan, and heat at Medium or Med-High. Stir in the Tomato Paste. Add most of the bottle of red wine, the sautéed onions and garlic and keep stirring. Gradually stir in the “Mrs. Dash” Tomato Basil Garlic Seasoning Blend, Oregano, and Sugar, and, keep stirring.

Add heat to the sauce until it begins to bubble (somewhere between a low boil and a simmer), and keep stirring. The Diced Tomatoes in their juice and Tomato Paste will thicken nicely.

Add the Meat and Sausage, reduce heat, cover and simmer on low, stirring regularly to prevent sticking, be sure to monitor the heat and scrape the bottom as the meat will tend to settle and stick (you’ve come too far to burn it now). The sauce is now ready to eat. But the longer it cooks the more the flavor will bloom. If you start the noodles now you should have a nice robust sauce by the time they are done. As for the unused wine, either add to the pot or the chef depending on preference, or it may be time to uncork another bottle.



Noodles: Fill the other Stew Pot 3/4 full with water and bring to a good boil. Add a splash of Olive Oil, 1 tsp salt, and the noodles and cook according to instructions on box (usually 8-10 minutes). Start testing noodles at 8 minutes (Al Dente-firm not crunchy or too soft is perfect). Timing is everything, when the texture is right of even just before, just before, remove from heat, pause to let the boiling stop, and CAREFULLY pour contents of pot into colander over the sink. Please be very careful with the recently boiling water (very dangerous). Spray a little cold water on the noodles and toss, (don’t rinse) to stop them cooking.



Serve Noodles with sauce, bread, and a salad.



NOTES:

Meat and Sausage: Leaner Meats like Ground Sirloin are nice, but, I like the flavor of plain Ground Meat or Chuck. You can also leave the Italian Sausage out, but I think it really adds to the flavor.



Herbs and Spices: I have found that “Mrs. Dash” has some excellent seasonings and have used them for many years. Her Tomato Basil Garlic Seasoning Blend is perfect for spaghetti sauce. The Grocery Store Spice Rack also has nice blends of Italian Seasonings you can experiment with. Naturally, Fresh Basil and/or Oregano will enhance the flavor, as will using fresh cloves of garlic, but all that chopping is a lot of work.



Tomatoes and Paste: I think the secret to this sauce is using diced tomatoes and tomato Paste rather than canned tomato sauce, it results in a thicker, richer sauce. You can experiment with the ratios of diced tomatoes to tomato paste to get your preferred consistency. There is nothing wrong with plain generic diced tomatoes and tomato paste. I tried the kind seasoned with Garlic, Basil, and Italian Herbs a while back, and try to mix at least a few cans of seasoned paste with the plain each time I make it.



Wine: Of course, the Wine is not absolutely essential, those who prefer an alcohol free sauce can easily substitute a like quantity of water. They say the alcohol evaporates during cooking anyway, to each his or her own. I personally think it adds flavor. Any inexpensive red wine will do, I like Merlot, but Chianti is probably better.



Lasagna: This Sauce is also wonderful in Lasagna, just layer with Lasagna Noodles, Ricotta Cheese, Sauce, Shredded Mozzarella, and Parmesan. I will add my recipe at a later date.



Chili Being a Good Texan, I also have a recipe for chili, coincidentally it’s the same base as my Spaghetti Meat Sauce. Just substitute Bratwurst for the Sausage, Cumin, Chili Powder, Paprika and Red Pepper for the Italian Seasonings, and a couple bottles of Shiner Bock for the Wine.



Hope you enjoy.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The FBI and CIA have had the dossier since before the election. The dossier has been in existence since last summer.



Again, if the CIA or FBI or any other alphabet agency had legitimate evidence to suggest collusion between the Kremlin & the Trump campaign, why didn't they release it during the primary season? Why not release it when Trump was named the nominee?



Hoax bin.

I see nothing but speculation and no evidence at all linking Trump to anything. Now, I don't think it is bad to speculate, after all the right speculated all the time about Obama and Hillary.It is amusing to see the complete reversal in the mindsets of the left and right, though. It should make it crystal clear to all that the veracity of information and the approach to presenting it, as well as the willingness to accept it has nothing to do with the information/evidence/data itself and ALL to do with political ideology.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's a rather dry read and extremely detail-intensive, going into almost excruciating play-by-play detail of Hoagland's long career at NASA.The most exciting thing about the book is, of course, the pictures, and of course the most exciting picture is the one of ""Data's Head"", which has already been linked to.Some sort of robot/android head lying there in a crater along with lots of what looks like debris from smashed machines? Definitive evidence of ET? Who knows?There are lots of other less exciting anomalous pictures of the Moon and Mars, which of course can be interpreted lots of different ways. Hoagland sees towers and pyramids and faces and cities; others may just see slightly weird-shaped rocks, craters etc.I have to admit, I actually find the chapter on NASA-conspiracy-theory more interesting than all the Moon and Mars stuff.Jack Parsons and L.

First I would like to apologize if this is in the wrong place. I posted in general chit chat to see where this topic should go and I had two suggestions for this particular area so I put it here.I live out in the middle of pretty much nothing. Sometime this is a curse but at other times I would not trade it for the world. I am surrounded by many open fields, vast areas of woods and lots of pastures. I like to go walking in the pastures after heavy rains because I found several arrow heads and tomahawks in the past. It seems like after it rains the top soil gets washed away sometimes revealing pretty neat items. The pasture closest to me is great because it is public land that is maintained by the state. They just cut it and bailed the hay so the grass is really short.Like I said before I like to walk in this particular one because of the items I have found in the past. The winter time is really great because they plow it all up and turn the earth over.It literally poured down rain for about 3 hours last night and since it was a substantial rainfall I figured I would go exploring to see if I can find anything like I have done many times in the past. I did not find much of anything and I started to head back to the house when I caught a glimpse of something shiny. When I first saw the object I thought it was an old green mason jar or something. I started to dig around it and it was not a jar at all. I have no idea what it is. It looks like a giant piece of glass or something but I have never seen glass this thick or that large unless you go visit and aquarium somewhere and on top of that it is colored. I dug around for more but this is the only piece I found.It is green in color and then on one side it starts changing into blue and turquoise. It looks like it has been smacked with a tiller a few times because it has some chips in it. It also has air bubbles in it as well as some black dots.I have no idea on what it is or where it came from and was wondering if anybody else can explain it or might know what it is.Edit: Screwed up the picture",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

i support Hillary 100%.....she's been through over 20 years of republican crap, who have accused her of a multitude of felonies, and even plotting the murder of Vince Foster. that's leaving out the grief ""horndog bill"" gave her. she's been a senator, and secretary of state...so, she has an idea what a president goes through, what a senator goes through, and what a cabinet member goes through....I think she is past the point where she will take crap from anyone else, foreign or domestic

Were you a Hillary supporter in 2008? I ask because I was and have since come to look at the 2008 DNC primary under a different lens.Obama was dragged across the finish line -- Hillary actually won the popular vote. Without the debacle in Michigan (and Florida) Obama wouldn't have won. In hindsight though, I wonder if Hillary helped Obama by keeping her name on the Michigan ballot.And, considering the factors favoring Bernie this election season, I wonder if Hillary isn't playing along with the email scandal.The State Department could have optically scanned 55,000 paper emails to text in 36 hours. Instead they have dragged this scandal out to Bernie's benefit for months -- acting like they have to read each one by hand. I don't think Hillary will be charged with anything. I think this whole scandal will just 'cause the demise' of her campaign. Hillary knows if there is anything indicating she committed a crime in those emails, she's a lawyer. She could have asked the State Department to auto-scan the paper emails and search for the 'keywords' they keep announcing -- confidential, secret, etc.. -- and be done with it. Her campaign is a great reason for a judge to consider such a request.I feel like the email scandal is manufactured to help Bernie (or Joe, I suppose -- I won't discount the possibility).All of that said, I liked Hillary for the very reasons you do. So, I understand your enthusiasm.But, I've looked at her past scandals critically in the last few years and feel like the ugly truth is that she is dirty -- yes, Vince Foster...and Mena....and Systematics, Inc., and BCCI....and in cahoots with Bush Sr.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
278441,"I live in the Extreme drought area of Texas. It is sad to see our state dry up.And instead of buying water and hauling it in the farmers will let it all dry up and bring the locus in to devour the crop lands. People in texas are good people but a little off in logic thinking. Our wild animals are dieing. I watched a family of quail slowly die off this year. early summer a family of 6 babies, mom and dad quail were comming into my yard within a week I watched the number deplete by 3. I started putting wild bird food out for them. Then in the next few days I noticed another baby gone so I had my husband buldl a small pond. I thought what the heck water is easy to get out there for them, and of course any other wild animal who is thirsty. Now for the past week we have mom dad and one baby left. I see on the news that the deer are abandoning there babies because they cant find enough food. There is a wild animal rescue center in middle texas. It is a critical situation here. I thought to myself, HAARP can manipulate weather well dang it manipulate clouds into texas you know.Then i got to thinking, jessie ventura uncovered a scheme the governmntn has going with trying to get the residents off the gulf -the show aired in louisianna. well here is texas strong growing in population, this could be a problem with the gov wanting to clear out the gulf. So why not make a drought happen. This is actually our 2nd year of drought, in 2008 there was a drought so bad the farmers themselves took the weather into their own hands and seeded the clouds, but, havent sense 2008, am wondering, did the government stop them from helping the crops by bringing the rain in? maybeNormal rainfall for this time of year is 23 inches, we had one rain last week gave us 3 inches.Did you all hear about the small city just outside san antronio, its water supply is all but gone, they are working on filtering sewage water into drinking water. Where I live there is a hugh lake. San ANtonio has been fighting our small city know for about 6 months they want to bring pipes to our lake and start sucking it up. But, thankfully we have a strong leasdership in our community and they aint haven it.",abovetopsecret.com,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am a human-like robot. I have a small ship (like the size of a mini-cooper). My ship and I are floating out in space. There are two handles on the back of my ship. I am ""standing"" between the handles, scrunched up in a ball with my knees to my chest, holding the handles so I don't float away from my spaceship. Now, if I let go of the handles and quickly straighten my legs ""downward"" towards my ship, what is going to happen? The ship and I will accelerate away from each other for a moment while my feet are pushing against it and then we will continue to float away from each other at whatever speed was achieved by my push. No air needed. In this example, I am acting as the rocket. This is fundamentally how rockets work, except with a controlled, continuous explosion rather than my legs and feet.
